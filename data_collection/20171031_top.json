Those are three different things. If I talked about Russia with campaign people (which is not illegal) and I tell the FBI that I did, and when I was talking about Russia I wasn't colluding with a foreign government (i.e whatever illegal colluding is) then I can tell the whole world about it on live TV because I haven't done anything illegal.Surely that's what he's doing here. Stating the truth; that he discussed Russia in emails with Paps. But we already know Paps wasn't colluding with the Russians (in the sense of illegal collusion of the type that Mueller is investigating) because Mueller's investigated him, read all his emails and determined that he's only guilty of lying about when he discussed Russia, rather than being guilty of illegal colluding with Russians*edit* That's one of the reasons I can't see the collusion aspect of the investigation yielding anything to cheer about. With all that we and Mueller know about Paps it's pretty obvious that he was colluding with the Russians (in a common sense layman's understanding of collusion). Yet he hasn't been charged with colluding with Russians or manipulation of an election or attempted manipulation, or anything that we can say is along the lines of collusion.

When the slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, it was a military strategy aimed at creating the sort of chaos and instability that everyone knew would result - and specifically excluding those territories not under revolt.One of the reasons that Dred Scott is generally viewed as one of the major events leading to the Civil War is precisely for the reason Kelly stated: it prevented the use of compromise to resolve such issues.In reality, slavery was a dying institution that probably wouldn't have lasted more than a few more decades anyway.  What was killing slavery was not moral outrage but industrialization.  There were plenty of people on both sides who were thinking about ways to wind down American slavery *without* a brutal war and the subsequent impoverishment and marginalization of millions of blacks.  Whether or not they could have accomplished this task is anyone's guess - but it's hard to imagine they would have done worse than what occurred in reality once compromise was taken off the table.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 34168, "comment_id": "dp50zn1", "score": -25, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 31 13:38:51 2017", "ups": -25}, {"body": "I know, right?

Those States have assume the right ofdeciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen ofthe States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they havepermitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign theproperty of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes;and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.**For twenty-five years this agitation has been steadily increasing, until it has now secured to its aid the power of thecommon Government. Observing the forms of the Constitution, a sectional party has found within that Article establishingthe Executive Department, the means of subverting the Constitution itself. A geographical line has been drawn across theUnion, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the UnitedStates, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the commonGovernment, because he has declared that that \"Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,\" and that thepublic mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction.* [...]*We, therefore, the People of South Carolina, by our delegates in Convention assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judgeof the world for the rectitude of our intentions, have solemnly declared that the Union heretofore existing between thisState and the other States of North America, is dissolved, and that the State of South Carolina has resumed her positionamong the nations of the world, as a separate and independent State; with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contractalliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent States may of right do.*____________TLDR; Non-slave states are enabling slaves to escape/rebel and not returning them.

It was the compromises for slavery made by the Federal government to appease Southern states which precipitated the Civil War.* 1820 Missouri Compromise : this compromise which determined which territories could become slave owning states was a sign that the exceptions added to the Constitution to give the slave owning states greater representation was not sustainable.* 1846 The Wilmot Proviso : a bill that was eventually killed by the influence of slave owning states would have made slavery illegal in all new states.* The Compromise of 1850 : This took parts of the Wilmot Proviso by preventing slavery from expanding into new states, but it also strengthened the Fugitive Slave Act, further forcing places where slavery was illegal to uphold the ownership of Southern slaves in their jurisdictions.* The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 : overturned the Missouri compromise, allowing two territories that were previously marked to not be slave owning territories to vote on the matter.  Both eventually decided to be non-slave states, but there was significant violence during the period known as Bleeding Kansas.* 1857 Dredd Scott vs Sanford : A slave sued for his freedom in a state where slavery was illegal.  The result by the Supreme Court identified him (and all slaves) as property and not able to sue.  This caused Southern states to renew calls for eliminating previously agreed upon territorial limits on slavery.* 1860 Lincoln is Elected : The Southern states were so fearful of Lincoln's anti-slavery outlook, that before he had even been inaugurated, Southern states started seceding.In short, each compromise made only inflamed the problems that the Civil War was eventually fought over.  Each inch given to the Southern states caused them to want to take a mile later down the road; and if the Federal Government had at some point taken a stand against the Southern States and given them a way to transition away from slavery instead of allowing them to play games and kick the legislative can down the road... it may have saved the 600,000+ lives lost.There were no fine people leading the South, as Mr. Kelly puts it, there were traitors and slavers... nothing more.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 145727, "comment_id": "dp50vla", "score": 113, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 31 13:35:47 2017", "ups": 113}, {"body": "*\"The adult in the room\"* - ladies and gentlemen.

The new court filings provided the first clear evidence that Trump campaign aides had early knowledge that Russia had stolen confidential documents on Mrs. Clinton and the committee, a tempting trove in a close presidential contest.By the time of a crucial meeting in June of last year, when Donald Trump Jr. and other senior Trump campaign officials met with a Russian lawyer offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, some may have known for weeks that Russia had material likely obtained by illegal hacking, the new documents suggested. The disclosures added to the evidence pointing to attempts at collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, but they appeared to fall short of proof that they conspired in the hacking or other illegal acts.The improbable figure at the center of the new information was a \u201cforeign policy adviser\u201d to Mr. Trump, George Papadopoulos. It was Mr. Papadopoulos, one of three men whose indictments were announced on Monday, who appears to have been the first campaign aide to learn about the Russian hacking of Democratic targetsA crucial detail is still missing: Whether and when Mr. Papadopoulos told senior Trump campaign officials about Russia\u2019s possession of hacked emails. And it appears that the young aide\u2019s quest for a deeper connection with Russian officials, while he aggressively pursued it, led nowhere.Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly promoted the idea of a \u201chistory making\u201d meeting between Mr. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. Senior campaign officials, however, said that Mr. Trump should not make the trip and leave it to someone \u201clow level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,\u2019\u2019 according to an email cited in court documents.Mr. Papadopoulos then proposed that he himself, perhaps with another campaign official, travel to Moscow to meet with the Russians.\u201cThe trip proposed by defendant PAPADOPOULOS did not take place,\u201d prosecutors wrote.To grasp the significance of Monday\u2019s developments, it helps to recall exactly how the Russian attack unfolded.In September 2015, the F.B.I. made its first call to the Democratic National Committee to report evidence of Russian hackers inside the committee\u2019s network. But for seven months, the word never got beyond an I.T. contractor, and the hackers apparently had the run of confidential emails and other files.During that time, Mr. Trump was pressed to assemble a team of foreign policy advisers, a difficult task because he was shunned by many Republicans who had served in earlier administrations. In early March, Mr. Papadopoulos, who had been helping the beleaguered campaign of Dr. Ben Carson, offered his services to the Trump campaign.Around March 6, documents say, a campaign supervisor \u2013 identified by a former Trump adviser as Sam Clovis \u2013 told Mr. Papadopoulos, then living in London, that \u201ca principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved relationship with Russia.\u201dA week later, traveling in Italy, Mr. Papadopoulos encountered a London-based professor of international relations, Joseph Mifsud, who claimed to have \u201csubstantial connections with Russian government officials.\u201d (The court documents do not name Mr. Mifsud, but a Senate aide briefed on the case identified him as the professor in question.)Unimpressed by Mr. Papadopoulos at first, Mr. Mifsud became far more interested when he learned that the young traveler was working for the Trump campaign. The two men met again in London on March 24, when the professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to a Russian woman he said was a relative of Mr. Putin with close ties to senior Russian officials.The same week, Mr. Trump, visiting The Washington Post, was pressed to name his foreign policy team. He read out five names, most of them with modest or nonexistent public profiles \u2013 including Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos began emailing campaign officials about his new contacts with his \u201cgood friend\u201d Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman, whom he incorrectly believed was Mr. Putin\u2019s niece, and the possibility of a Trump-Putin meeting.On March 31, back in Washington, Mr. Papadopoulos met Mr. Trump for the first time at a gathering of his new foreign policy team at the candidate\u2019s Washington hotel. According to the former Trump adviser who was there, and who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid offending former colleagues, Mr. Papadopoulos spoke for a few minutes about his Russian contacts and the prospects for a meeting with the Russian president.But several people in the room began to raise questions about the wisdom of a meeting with Mr. Putin, noting that Russia was under sanctions from the United States. Jeff Sessions, now attorney general and then a senator from Alabama who was counseling Mr. Trump on national security, \u201cshut George down,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do it\u2019 and he added, \u2018I\u2019d prefer that nobody speak about this again.\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Papadopoulos was not deterred, the documents say, and he continued to communicate with Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman about more contacts. The Russian woman wrote on April 11, \u201cwe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump.\u201d Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos over email to a Moscow contact who said he had connections to the Russian foreign ministry. They spoke repeatedly over Skype about a possible Moscow trip, the documents say.J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon official who worked for the Trump campaign as a national security adviser, helped arrange the March 31 foreign policy meeting.On April 26 came a crucial meeting. At breakfast at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow, where he had \u201clearned that the Russians had obtained \u2018dirt\u2019 on then-candidate Clinton.\u201d Mr. Mifsud said he had been told the Russians had \u201cthousands of emails.\u201dOn May 4, the Russian contact with ties to the foreign ministry wrote to Mr. Papadopoulos and Mr. Mifsud, saying ministry officials were \u201copen for cooperation.\u201d Mr. Papadopoulos forwarded the message to a senior campaign official, asking whether the contacts were \u201csomething we want to move forward with.\u201dThe court documents describe in detail how Mr. Papadopoulos continued to report to senior campaign officials on his efforts to arrange meetings with Russian officials, which The Washington Post\u00a0reported on in August. But the documents do not say explicitly whether, and to whom, he passed on his most explosive discovery \u2013 that the Russians had what they considered compromising emails on Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent.J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon official who worked for the Trump campaign as a national security adviser and helped arrange the March 31 foreign policy meeting, said he had known nothing about Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019 discovery that Russia had obtained Democratic emails or of his prolonged pursuit of meetings with Russians.\u201cI was surprised to learn what George Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign,\u201d Mr. Gordon said in a text message. \u201cHe obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Senator Sessions.\u201dMr. Gordon said that such end-runs around normal channels are common in presidential campaigns. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to know what every single person is doing, especially since some folks deliberately go around the chain of command,\u201d he said. \u201cBut George Papadopoulos obviously represents an extreme case.\u201dProsecutors may have deliberately left salient details out of the documents filed in court to protect the continuing investigation. But what they did say portrays Mr. Papadopoulos as continuing for months to arrange meetings with Russian officials. As late as August 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos was advised by a campaign official, apparently Mr. Clovis, to travel to Moscow \u201cif it is feasible.\u201dInstead of opening a new era in relations with Russia, Mr. Papadopoulos found himself caught up in the investigation of the Russian interference in the American election. The documents accuse him of lying to F.B.I. agents in two interviews, first on Jan. 27 and then on Feb. 16, when he \u201creiterated his purported willingness to cooperate with the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation,\u201d according to an affidavit filed by Robert M. Gibbs, an F.B.I. agent investigating the case.On Feb. 17, the agent wrote, Mr. Papadopoulos shut down the Facebook account he had used since 2005, including to exchange messages with the intermediaries for Russia. Prosecutors considered that to be obstruction of justice, and it became part of the case that concluded Oct. 5 when Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to make a false statement to the F.B.I., which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 7734, "comment_id": "dp4isc5", "score": 15, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 31 03:27:39 2017", "ups": 15}, {"body": "Which means Sessions goes down for Perjury.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 55777, "comment_id": "dp4iu68", "score": 11, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 31 03:28:33 2017", "ups": 11}, {"body": "This dude used Facebook Messenger and just thought he could delete his account.

Jeff Sessions, now attorney general and then a senator from Alabama who was counseling Mr. Trump on national security, \u201cshut George down,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do it\u2019 and he added, \u2018I\u2019d prefer that nobody speak about this again.\u2019\u201dHe kept pushing the idea to the Trump campaign but people shut him down in the meeting. But but here is the thing. This possibly shows that the President and higher ranking members of his administration and cabinet knew what this kid was up too. > On April 26 came a crucial meeting. At breakfast at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow, where he had \u201clearned that the Russians had obtained \u2018dirt\u2019 on then-candidate Clinton.\u201d Mr. Mifsud said he had been told the Russians had \u201cthousands of emails.\u201dHere my friends is the prize.

A third \"friend\" said, \"I've only hit a few of my girlfriends.\"One guy went so far as to say all of Italy's provinces should be their own countries, and started spewing diatribe about how his province has to support immigrants that aren't even in it and it could simply be resolved by seceding and actively tossing them out for another province to take care of.Some of the Italian men I bunked with would say things like, \"What a whore (Che una puttana)\" and other horrible things of women minding their own business in rather conservative clothing.All of these guys are super nationalist.  I wouldn't call them \"White nationalist\", because they despise other EU immigrants and the EU just as well.Italian men of more rational mindedness would excuse the behavior of their fellow ragazzi.  I never heard a single Italian man reproach another for any of the above.  The only male \"Italians\" whom would do such were myself, a South African Italian (1st gen), and a Brazilian Italian (2nd gen).  We were constantly told to stay out of it.Meanwhile, the Italian women in my program constantly reprimanded them, and would tell me, \"wtf is wrong with these guys?\"  I never understood why Italian men and women are so vastly different from each other.It's a pretty sick situation over there.  They absolutely do experience some of the worst when it comes to immigration, because Italy acts as a doorway to the rest of the EU.  However, that's no excuse for advocating genocide and calling all women whores.Edit: No, not all Italians (nor men/women) were like this, but the closer I got to certain Italians, the more comfortable they felt sharing this kind of dialogue.  If you had a different experience in Italy, please do share.Also, gotta love being told to \"fuck off\" because my anecdote/experience shattered someone's narrative.

Quick translation:>**Arrest warrant because of suspicion of Preparation of a Serious Violent Offence Endangering the State**>The Federal Public Prosecutor General this morning ordered the execution of an arrest warrant against>19-year-old Syrian citizen Yamen A.>for suspicion of Preparation of a Serious Violent Offence Endangering the State ([\u00a7 89a StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0908)). The order was executed by special forces of the Federal Police and the Federal Criminal Police Office in Schwerin. Additionally, the flats of the defendant and a further person, not yet under suspicion, in Schwerin and Hamburg.> According to investigations so far, the defendant Yamen A. is strongly suspected to have planned and concretely prepared an islamistically-motivated attack with high-explosive matter in Germany.>It is currently known that Yamen A. came to his decision in July 2017 at the latest, to detonate an explosive device in Germany and kill and maim a high number of persons. He then began to procure components and chemicals needed to create an explosive device. It is yet unclear whether the defendant had already chosen a concrete target for his attack. >There are no indications that the defendant belongs to any terrorist organisation. >A press conference is being set up for 14:00 o'clock.---**[Update from 15:00](http://www.generalbundesanwalt.de/de/showpress.php?themenid=19&newsid=735)**:>Today's executive measures were carried out by the GSG-9 and special forces of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) as well as the States of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Hamburg, and Schleswig-Holstein, under the leadership of the BKA. Starting point for the investigation that began on 21st October 2017 were findings by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, on the basis of which the BKA was able to identify the accused person.>As to the current state of the investigation, the following can be said:>1. The accused, Yamen A., decided not after July 2017 to detonate an explosive device in a sizable crowd in Germany and to thereby kill and maim as many people as possible.>2. To carry out his plan, he researched recipes for building detonation devices in social networks. He also communicated with persons inside the jihadist spectrum via the internet.>3. The accused began procuring the materials for building an explosive device in the end of July 2017. Among other things, he ordered sulfuric acid and an oxidizer-solution containing hydrogen peroxide. Both chemicals, as well as acetone, are needed to create the high-explosive material  triacetone triperoxide (TATP). It must be assumed that the accused planned to create this explosive. The ordering of a thermometer also speaks for this, as the creation process requires cooling.>4. According to the criminal technicians inside the BKA, the amount of the ordered chemicals point towards TATP merely being planned to be used as a propelling charge in the detonator as a so-called \"initiating explosive\". This, in turn, leads to the assumption of an explosive device of considerable strength. >5. The accused also procured two mobile radios, batteries, and a battery for a mobile phone. This speaks for a remote detonation through radio or mobile phone.>6. During today's searches, the acetone that's needed for the creation of TATP but had previously been missing among the procurements has been found. The containers were already partially opened. One of the mobile radios has also been tampered with. According to the BKA's criminal technicians, it must be assumed that the accused had already started to build a detonative device.>7. As of now, there's no clues that the accused had already procured the materials needed for his main explosive charge. While he did order 10kg  hydrogen peroxide in the end of September 2017, he had canceled the order for as-yet unknown reasons.>8. There are no findings to suggest that the accused had already settled on a concrete target.>9. The accused was in contact with a person that called themselves a \"soldier of the caliphate,\" that is, a member of the so-called Islamic State. The identity of that person is as-yet unknown. It is also unclear inhowfar this person had strengthened the accused in his resolve. A incidental suspicion of the accused's membership in a terrorist organisation as per [\u00a7\u00a7 129a, 129b StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1222), namely the so-called Islamic State, is not currently held up.>10. There are currently no provable suspicions of additional people being involved in the preperations and plannings of the accused. He had been observed by the Mobile Deployment Commando of the BKA for a longer period of time. During this time, he was in contact with persons that are not opposed to jihadist thought. Inhowfar these persons knew about the concrete plans of the accused or were even in cahoots with him must be shown through further investigations. Today's search did not bring up further information on that front.>The accused will be brought to the investigative judge of the Federal Court of Justice tomorrow who will decide about issuing an arrest warrant and ordering investigative custody.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 53938, "comment_id": "dp5ar7s", "score": 45, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 31 16:53:35 2017", "ups": 45}, {"body": "It's actually pretty amazing they prevented it.

This study found correlation between depression treatment (including medication) and long term depression, but that's not enough to determine causation without more detailed study. Here's the tell for me: It found correlation between **ANY treatment** and worse long term outcomes. Note that 'any treatment' included a group for 'inadequate treatment *without medication*' which was defined as less than 8 visits to a therapist, and this group ALSO had worse outcomes than no treatment. Why would having only 1-7 visits to a therapist result in noticeably worse long term outcomes years later unless there were underlying differences between patients? That indicates to me there is significant variation between the treated and non-treated groups that was not detected by the surveys used. The study claims to control for severity, but depression can be short and intense, or long and enduring, with similar peak severity. The nature of each person's depression can vary noticeably.It seems likely there is self-selection bias involved. People with relapsing/chronic depression more likely to seek treatment if the depression remains severe over an extended time, whereas if the depression does not recur or reduces in severity due to outside factors, they are less likely to pursue treatment.I'd be interested to see the actual text of the study, as well as the wording of the surveys used. Also note that the researchers on this study did not do any of their own testing/surveys, they analyzed data from previous surveys.

There is no evidence to suggest that the incident was part of a wider terrorist plot; no outstanding suspect or active threat remains in the area. * Schools in the Lower Manhattan area were placed on a precautionary lockdown, and area roads have been closed while the investigation continues by multiple law enforcement agencies.* At approximately 3:05pm local time, a 29 year old male drove a rented Home Depot truck onto a bike/pedestrian path along West St from W Houston St to Chambers St, driving south. * The vehicle came to a stop when it struck the rear of a school bus, injuring two children and two adults. * The suspect then emerged from the truck with a paintball gun and a pellet gun; although, it is unclear if any projectiles were fired. * The suspect was shot in the abdomen by an officer assigned to the area and has been transported to an unspecified hospital. * The suspect is described as not from New York City, but further specifics have not been confirmed. * Additional officers have been deployed as a precaution to strategic locations in the New York City area, including along the route of the Village Halloween Parade. * At this time, there are no reports that any organization has claimed responsibility for the attack.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 9581, "comment_id": "dp5nh6m", "score": 3495, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 31 20:32:49 2017", "ups": 3495}, {"body": "CNN: Up to 6 now dead.

I'm a dude and live in Miami, worked at a print shop a few years ago when i was 26. I crossed the street one day to get lunch and a mercedes approaches and drives parallel to me with the windows lowered. The guy driving says something and thinking he needs help with directions I turn my attention to him. He looks like a normal dude, just well dressed guy in a suit and looks at me and says, \"get in\". He spoke Spanish (i am fluent) and his tone and delivery clearly made the word \"montate\" sound like a command. I was caught off guard completely by this statement and said something to the effect of what the fuck did you just say? Again he just says \"montate\". I reply \"oye que te pasa\" (means hey wtf is wrong with you) after hearing to be told to get in his car twice. It seems he realized immediately that I wasn't interested in his initial pitch and he quickly shifts to, \"oh, uh, you see I'm a fashion designer and my producer would love someone like you for his new project, and you totally have the look, hop in and we can discuss the details\".Now, I'm a pretty decent person, and when in retrospect i should have told him to \"fuck off\", i just calmly said i don't hop into cars with strange men who pull up on me on the side of the road and say they have a model or actor deal for me. And he just hands me a business card and drives off. When i get back to the office i google his name and sure enough he turns out to be a famous clothing designer from latin America. the way he casually pulled up on me though, it's like he's done that shit a million times and he just happened to strike out with me. anyway, just wanted to share the fact I believe these people just don't give a fuck and do as they please.Edit: some folks were asking why I was so put off by this man's advance, and how this relates to sexual assault, so I explained a little more about how he interacted with me before he pulled away above in the first paragraph. This guy was not flirting with me, I've had men hit on me before and this was different. Everything from his tone to the way he made eye contact with me was not normal. You don't just command someone you pull up to, to get inside their car. It's not like he catcalled to me heyyyy cutie want a ride? It was just the word \"montate\". Spoken like how you would tell your dog to do something. It was only when he realized that I was possibly going to get aggressive that he played it off as wanting to hook me up with a sweet job. But for fuck's sake people, we're adults here and we know what he was trying to do. Had I sat down in the car with him thinking oh hey I am going to be a model now, who knows what the fuck he would have said or done.

According to [this](https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Utah_State_Public_Service_10-Codes) it is an obvious fatal. **Ninja Edit:** I live just down the hill and the amount of sirens passing by is surreal. I hope this ends soon and in the best way possible.**Edit 2:** Suspect description white male, all black, beany, cross and tear drop tattoo on the face. Not to speculate, but this sounds domestic/gang related  more than mass shooting attempt. Obviously, we won't know until the scene is over. *Fixed the description.***Edit 3:** A potential suspect was taken into custody, however it sounds like it is not the guy. The FLIR (Forward Looking Infra-Red) on the helicopter thought it was a male in all black, but this person doesn't match the description. Helicopter will continue scanning.**Edit 4:** Possible location of the suspect. 3rd floor in a breakroom of a building in research park. Didn't catch the name of the building.**Edit 5:** Currently clearing vehicles in a parking lot. Unknown location.**Edit 6:** Possible sighting of suspect at the (I may have heard wrong) E. E. Jones Medical Research Building. Dark Clothes, Beany. Will update if info is wrong.**Edit 7:** Person of interest walking down South Medical Drive. 5'8\", \"kinda chubby\", dark clothing. *fixed as u/Sk84sv had the actual wording***Edit 8:** Possible sighting at School of Medicine.**Final Edit:** My girlfriend was on campus when this all started. She made it home and is shaken up so I am going to go be with her for the night.**Edit 9:** Aaaaand I'm back. I'm with my girlfriend but she is fine. So I'll update a little longer. Sounds like the suspect is in an aquatic center locker room.**Edit 10:** Sounds like there is a fire alarm going off. One person in the Williams Building.**Edit 11:** Campus security in Williams Building says man in dark clothing. Sounds like he came out with hands-up. Officers will be talking with him.**Edit 12:** Not the suspect in reference to edit 11**Edit 13:** REMOVED. Posted officer location info without thinking.**Edit 14:** Sounds like a construction contractor was in the Williams Building and pulled the fire alarm. Possibly to notify police of suspect? That's just my own speculation. But sounds like a false alarm**Edit 15:** Multiple construction workers in area of Williams Building. Sounds like one of the construction workers matched description. Likely false alarm.**Edit 16:** Rifle was found 30 yards east of the suspects vehicle. *Could be the victims vehicle***Edit 17:** Williams Building is Code 4 (All clear)**Edit 18:** Not a lot happening right now. They are continuing to search.**Edit 19:** [Suspect photo released](https://twitter.com/slcpd/status/925234230963052544)**Edit 20:** I found his wife's youtube. A video shows him 2 months ago with a new tattoo over his eyebrow. Looks like \"Cursed\" to me. [Screenshot here](https://imgur.com/9urlUfC)**Edit 21:** via u/Denotsyek [Police Scanner](https://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/18656) and [Utah 10-Codes](https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Utah_State_Public_Service_10-Codes)**Edit 22:** In regards to the screenshot I posted: It is not difficult to find both his and his wife's youtube account. With that said, I would encourage you to not seek out his wife's youtube in order to harass her. From what I have come to understand from the scanner, she has been cooperative with the police in some capacity. Do not attack her. When this bastard is finally caught, he will get his justice.**Edit 23:** This will actually be my final edit. I have been going at this for 3 hours now and the scanners are really starting to die down. Hopefully they find this guy tonight. But I need to get to bed. Hug your family and friends, people. The world can be a scary place.**Edit 24:** Good morning, everyone. What a crazy night that has continued on into the morning. At the moment, the suspect is still at large. The University has lifted its shelter in place and cancelled all classes today in rememberence of the student killed.[This is ChenWei Guo](https://twitter.com/newsycaitlin/status/925334400685899776), an international student from China. He was killed in an attempted carjacking after the suspect and his wife had a violent domestic altercation. The University of Utah is working with ChenWei's parents to get them here as soon as possible.The search will continue on through the day until this guy is found.
