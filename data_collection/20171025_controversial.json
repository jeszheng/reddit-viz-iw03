According to this WaPo article, 4th paragraph, Clinton's law firm, Perkins Coie, hired Fusion GPS to dig dirt on Trump in APRIL 2016\u2026.In paragraph 21, WaPo tells us that \"Some of Steele\u2019s allegations began circulating in Washington in the summer of 2016 as the FBI launched its counterintelligence investigation into possible connections between Trump associates and the Kremlin.\"Just so we're all clear here, it looks like OBAMA's team used the Clinton-funded \"Trump Dossier\" as the basis for obtaining a FISA Warrant in the special court for counterintelligence to spy on Trump's campaign workers, including at the very least Paul Manafort and Carter Paige.  THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY THAT OBAMA DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE TRUMP DOSSIER WAS CLINTON CAMPAIGN \"OPPO\" WORK PRODUCT WHEN IT PRESENTED THAT DOSSIER TO THE INTELLIGENCE COURT AS EVIDENCE.So Clinton put together a fake dossier that Obama then bootstraps into an intelligence investigation of the Trump campaign for purposes of spying on Trump and his associates during an election year.   THIS IS A FUCKING HUGE SCANDAL FOLKS.This is a fabrication to shift blame to trump for the uranium one scandal, which it appears the podesta group is also tied into as more information has come out recently.

I live in the south where Pitbulls are just about every other dog.  Unlike other parts of the country, the good ol boys who get pitbulls around here aren\u2019t buying them as status symbols or to look hard in front of their friends.  They\u2019re hunting dogs, work dogs, and family pets.  The old country guy who comes to spray for pests once a month is in love with my dog.  Pitbulls are a staple in the south.  That being said, I\u2019ve been working with and training dogs for the past two years now and every pit bull I\u2019ve met at work has been a bubbly goofy fun family dog without a malicious bone in their body.  They\u2019re very loyal, obedient, and exceptionally easy to train too.  We often have over a hundred dogs in our facility and truth be told, I\u2019ll take the pitbulls over just about any other breed we\u2019ve got.  It\u2019s honestly the smaller breed dogs that I have an issue with.I ended up adopting a pit but like I said, I know dogs well, I work with them, I\u2019m trained and know how to socialize and train a dog.  I treat my pit bull like a daughter and she is extremely cuddly and friendly.  She\u2019s also 70 plus pounds and fully capable of killing someone if she wanted.The point is, pitbulls are dogs.  period.  They\u2019re going to behave like dogs.  They aren\u2019t monsters, they aren\u2019t angels.  They\u2019re dogs.  Knowing what they are capable of means that most people who have a pit are going to make sure they go through far more training and socialization than your average dog.  It\u2019s not that they *require* more training or socialization than other dogs but the stigma makes it necessary.  A shit dog owner can usually get away with mistreating or neglecting their small breed house dogs.  They\u2019ll have a shitty destructive disobedient dog but it just won\u2019t be capable of killing a person.  Failure to properly train and socialize a pit bull on the other hand can have deadly consequences.  Every large breed is dangerous though.  Every large breed is capable of killing and maiming a person.  Even Labrador retrievers score lower on temperament tests than pitbulls do.  I don\u2019t know what the solution is because banning a breed that doesn\u2019t deserve the ban is absolutely something I\u2019m against.  But demanding a certain level of responsibility from people who get pitbulls is an absolute must.  I love my dog and I won\u2019t give her up without a fight. (Truth be told, I\u2019d likely get violent if someone came to my home to take her away from me)  That said...  I\u2019d be more than happy to go through obligatory training, testing, and licensing to prove I\u2019m a responsible pitbull handler/owner because the truth is, there aren\u2019t just people out there who have no business owning pitbulls...  there are people out there who have no business owning a dog period.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 102, "stickied": false, "score": 32, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 17:09:41 2017", "ups": 32}, {"body": "I've been bailed up by piece of shit pitbulls on two occasions, after doing absolutely nothing, except walking along the street.
