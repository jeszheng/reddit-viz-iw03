Those are meaningful victories that shouldn't be overlooked. That being said, I don't necessarily think some measure of success constitutes \"an appropriate handling of the situation.\" The making up silly names for Kim Jong Un is most likely harmful to the efforts of the State Department, but (contrary to what many people seem to believe) I don't have a problem with the threats of military action. If your enemy legitimately believes that military action is an option (even if it's the last thing on your mind) then they'll be much less likely to directly antagonize you, and it gives your negotiating team some serious leverage. This was the inherent problem with the Obama approach, because the North Koreans knew that, short of an actual invasion of South Korea, there was no chance of him ever using military force.

The best hope we've had is getting the people of North Korea to realize they're being treated poorly, and rise up against an obviously misleading and manipulative government, and a lot of progress had been made in educating the populace through leaks of entertainment and media from other countries. But Trump's threats play directly into the hands of the North Korean leadership who have been more or less lying about American hatred and aggression for 50 years. Now they literally have direct quotes from the American president saying that they're all going to die burning. Trump's entire approach relies on the assumption that Kim is bluffing, and will never use any of the weapons they have against his enemies, and Trump basically wants to push him to the cliff and tell him to jump if he's going to jump. If Kim decides to let his bluff get called, then Trump \"wins\" but North Korea is much further away from world integration than they would be through other approaches. The whole country still loses tons of respect (that they believe they have), and feel that the entire rest of the planet is their enemy. If Kim feels that he *can't* back down because his family has spent literally more than 50 years programming the population to believe he's a God who can't ever fail or whatever, what happens?Everything Trump is alluding to (or outright threatening) leads very very easily to tens of millions of innocent people dead, and after that, we're left with potentially hundreds of millions of refugees from North Korea and the surrounding areas with nobody else very excited to take them in.

The diverging section (bell) allows the gases to expand, speed up, and drop in pressure. The specific bell shape comes about to control the expansion of the gas. Ideally, the gas is allowed to expand just enough that the pressure of the gas at the nozzle exit equals the pressure of the atmosphere around, and the shockwave from the gas changing from super to subsonic occurs at the exit plane. If the nozzle is too big at the exit, the gas pressure drops below the atmospheric pressure and atmospheric air actualy enters the engine and drops efficiency. Shocks also form inside the engine nozzle. If it is too small, the gases exit the nozzle at a higher pressure than atmosphere, and you lose efficiency because the air has left over energy that could be converted to velocity still. Shocks also form at weird places outside the engine. The characteristic smoothness of the bell helps the flow change continuously and in a laminar fashion.

If you want you can go back to the ancient Greeks who had vigorous debates about vacuum and nothing, and nothingness. But to make it short, if you skip forward to Newton's day, you'd had Torricelli and Pascal having established that a vacuum (in the present-day sense) existed, and how air pressure worked and decreased with altitude. The theory of gravity helped show why, and by Newton's laws of motion, the planets should stay in motion as long as there's nothing there to slow them down, i.e. they move in a vacuum. That left the problem of how light moves through the vacuum. Which wasn't such a problem for Newton himself as he held a 'corpuscular' (particle) view of light. That view lost out (for a time) against the wave theory of light, due to the work by Fresnel and others. So that's when they came up with the ether/aether, as a medium for those waves. A mysterious 'gas' of sorts that permeated everything, allowed light waves to ripple through it, yet didn't seem to interact much with ordinary matter. Now you get some semantics issues. Is this a vacuum or not? It's not a vacuum in the sense that it's 'empty' as the aether (as ill-defined as it was) was there. But a vacuum, as in a space devoid of ordinary matter, the thing you create with a vacuum pump, always contained aether. So even when they believed in the aether, space was still mostly devoid of ordinary matter.Then the late 19th century Michelson-Morley experiment famously showed that the aether didn't follow the rules of relative motion. And thus it was concluded it didn't exist, at least not as some kind of invisible 'fluid' or 'gas'. Science at the time had gotten very fed up with invisible fluids that permeated everything after having debunked a number of them (chemical oxidation was explained by the invisible 'phlogiston', heat by 'caloric', and electricity was also though to be an invisible 'fluid' prior to the electron's discovery). Conceptually aether got replaced with the concept of the electromagnetic field, which rather than a kind of subtle 'matter', is a _property of space itself_.

If you want you can go back to the ancient Greeks who had vigorous debates about vacuum and nothing, and nothingness. But to make it short, if you skip forward to Newton's day, you'd had Torricelli and Pascal having established that a vacuum (in the present-day sense) existed, and how air pressure worked and decreased with altitude. The theory of gravity helped show why, and by Newton's laws of motion, the planets should stay in motion as long as there's nothing there to slow them down, i.e. they move in a vacuum. That left the problem of how light moves through the vacuum. Which wasn't such a problem for Newton himself as he held a 'corpuscular' (particle) view of light. That view lost out (for a time) against the wave theory of light, due to the work by Fresnel and others. So that's when they came up with the ether/aether, as a medium for those waves. A mysterious 'gas' of sorts that permeated everything, allowed light waves to ripple through it, yet didn't seem to interact much with ordinary matter. Now you get some semantics issues. Is this a vacuum or not? It's not a vacuum in the sense that it's 'empty' as the aether (as ill-defined as it was) was there. But a vacuum, as in a space devoid of ordinary matter, the thing you create with a vacuum pump, always contained aether. So even when they believed in the aether, space was still mostly devoid of ordinary matter.Then the late 19th century Michelson-Morley experiment famously showed that the aether didn't follow the rules of relative motion. And thus it was concluded it didn't exist, at least not as some kind of invisible 'fluid' or 'gas'. Science at the time had gotten very fed up with invisible fluids that permeated everything after having debunked a number of them (chemical oxidation was explained by the invisible 'phlogiston', heat by 'caloric', and electricity was also though to be an invisible 'fluid' prior to the electron's discovery). Conceptually aether got replaced with the concept of the electromagnetic field, which rather than a kind of subtle 'matter', is a _property of space itself_.

You won't be able to walk or run fast enough to notice the difference in gravity, but a large radius means a very high cost.The idea of making two relatively small habitable volumes connected by a long cable is often brought up in AskScience, but IMO it'd be really difficult (if at all possible) for a spacecraft to dock with your rotating space station if you don't have a non-rotating or slowly-rotating part in the center.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 24924, "stickied": false, "score": 6, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 18:25:17 2017", "ups": 6}, {"body": "In any rotating frame of reference there are apparent centrifugal and coriolis forces.

Every post he makes drives me crazy for it's genereal lack of factual relivence. Here is is post about the recent Boy Scout/ Girls news.\"A quick note on the Boy Scouts deciding to remove any remaining reason for their own existence by admitting girls.Many people have told me that this is good and fair because the Boy Scouts offers the opportunity to do things that girls can't do in Girl Scouts. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's completely irrelevant.Here's a crazy idea: maybe not everything in society needs to be centered around giving opportunities to girls. Maybe not everything is about girls always. Maybe some things are about boys and for boys. Or used to be, anyway. It's OK for boys to have their own spaces. It's OK for boys to do their own thing sometimes. Or it used to be, anyway.Boy Scouts are supposed to be for boys. That's the whole point. It's right in the name of the organization. Boy Scouts were meant to help boys become men. Girls don't need help becoming men because they're girls.This may be a scandalous notion for feminists, but guess what? Sometimes boys like to just be around other boys and have the kind of male bonding that is simply not possible if girls are forced into the mix. And this bonding is important. It's essential to the healthy formation of boys.I know there are girl who like to say, \"I'm just one of the guys, really.\" But you're not. You're not one of the guys anymore than I'm one of the girls. Maybe you like camping and sports and whatever else, but that doesn't make you a boy, nor does it entitle you to intrude into every single male space or male gathering.And we wonder why our boys are struggling so much. They're growing up with the impression that there's nothing special or unique about boyhood, and their desire to just be with the guys sometimes is wrong and bigoted. They're made to hate themselves and forced to bond with girls in a way that's unnatural and unfulfilling, pretending that they see the girls just as they see other boys. It's confusing, degrading, and unfair.Meanwhile, girls can still have their own spaces. Except for the locker room. Boys can go there. Because nothing makes sense in our ridiculous culture.\"Source: https://www.facebook.com/MattWalshBlogAlso, he apparently worked for Glenn Beck.

Because a guy who doesn't take 'no' for an answer the first time, who may not even think he did anything wrong, is definitely not going to listen the next time or the time after that. If you don't at the very least call him out on this (and I vote for a full on screaming-rage-fight, preferably through a telephone, since if silent glaring didn't do the trick then volume might, but that's just me) then the message he is going to take away from this morning is that you're fine with it. Or, maybe you aren't fine with it, but just like leaving the toilet seat up or not doing his share of the dishes, it's not that big a deal. He absolutely will do it again.

I made my \"quit that, it's annoying\" sound and slept for what was probably just another minute or two before he was doing it again. I grunted more aggressively and he stopped again. I went back to sleep and then was roused again (not sure how long I slept that time) with my boyfriend pulling my PJ pants off. I sleepily made another \"stop it\" sound, but it was pretty obvious what I was saying because my boyfriend replied, \"Hey,\" in this tone that suggested, \"Just be quiet and let me do this, please.\" I wasn't speaking because I take meds for insomnia and words were a bit beyond me this early in the morning. However, I remember I was clear in what I meant because my boyfriend did respond by stopping a few times, and then even went so far as to tell me to stop complaining. Despite being under the drugs I remember thinking pretty clearly, \"Wow, this is happening. I'm actually being raped. I told him to stop and he basically told me to shut up.\" So I just laid there and let him finish. Afterwards he was acting like he always does after sex, as if this was a normal encounter. I just sort of sat there and glared at him. I eventually went back to sleep because it was ridiculously early. It doesn't really feel like I was raped though. I know I was, since I'm a firm believer in stopping when the other person says no, but I'm feeling that since I just laid there and went back to sleep afterwards with no problems I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is. My strongest feelings about this are, \"You're sort of an asshole.\" I don't feel like my life is that changed. I don't feel like it'll even impact our next sex encounter. Things rape victims say they feel afterwards I'm just not feeling. My attitude towards the whole situation is pretty much, \"Meh.\" I know I should be more upset. I know I should even break up with him after this, but I probably won't. Basically, I was raped (I think) and don't care all that much.

I went to an adult school where most students are 17+. I became pretty good friends with a guy in my classes, he seemed very harmless and sweet. Anyway one night we decided to have some drinks together. We ended up leaving and sitting in the park, just talking. It got dark and he went and bought more alcohol, he poured my drinks and made them really strong. I drank anyway because I'm stupid and wanted to have fun. Well it got to a point where I was resting my head on his shoulder and he kissed me. I kissed him back and we made out for a while. I was very drunk at this point and for a reason I don't remember I stood up and began walking away. He walked behind me and grabbed me, so I ran and he chased me. It became a sortof game and we were laughing. Then he caught me and pushed me onto the grass and got ontop of me. I started to panic and tried to get away but he held me down and was kissing me so I let him. He then started groping me and I told him I don't want to have sex, and I distinctly remember him saying \"if you don't I'll kill you\" so I just laid there. He pulled my pants down and penetrated me and I started crying and saying it hurt. After about a minute he stopped without finishing and stood up. After that I don't remember anything except getting a lift home. Writing it out it does sound like I was assaulted but I also feel like it was my fault for encouraging him by kissing. Rape is a very strong accusation to put on someone but it has been over a year and I still feel disgusted. I had to see him every day at school after that and he acted like nothing happened and was indifferent towards me.

A good friend of fifteen years now.For a long time she worked as a police officer and then an armed guard. She is a trans woman, which is relevant.

Again, I am supportive of this as I have no issue with sex workers.But- over the past month or so, she has started working for this guy/company. They have her on some kind of drug 24/7 and make her listen to hypnosis tapes to make her more submissive. Normally I don't really believe in hypnosis, but it seems to be having some effect in combination with the drugs.They have her working with other girls. They are offering to pay for her sex reassignment surgery in exchange for her her work. She has to follow their instructions exactly. They want to send her to a \"training camp\"... in the middle of nowhere in the desert. Cut off from all of society.She is getting the leader's name tattooed on her. A typical pimp tactic.When I talk to her, she can't have normal conversations anymore. All she talks about is her work and the drugs and the guy she works for. She seems mesmerized. We used to have deep conversations for hours and hours about so many things. Now she is a one dimensional stepford wife robot.I am *extremely fucking worried* about her. I don't know what to do. So far I have been acting curious and probing her for information. Apparently these people have been involved in things like kidnappings/rape. She seems upset about the idea of going to the \"training camp\" but is going along with it anyway.I don't know what to do? Is this as bad as it seems? because it seems really bad to me. I desperately want to save my friend. Please help.She is so caught up in the idea of how much money they're telling her she can make and the fact that they're offering to do gender reassignment surgery/breast augmentation for her for free.

Personally, I'd go for a doctor first, because it can be really quick to resolve once diagnosed. As with any other medical case, you should expect to go through a serious of tests and have the doctor analyse the results and sort out the possible origins. *disclosure, I'm not a doctor myself, but I am familiar with hormone therapy and it should not be taken lightly, so I recommend only doing it under the care of a medical expert.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 12333, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 18:46:14 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "It is natural for our libidos to wax and wane throughout our lives. There is probably nothing wrong with you or your testosterone (although it can't hurt to get it checked), this is just how your body works right now. You may find that your libido comes roaring back into action in a couple years, or maybe this is just gonna be your normal from here on out. Either way, one thing that definitely *isn't* going to bring it back is stressing out about it. Worrying about it, taking pills for it, all of that is just putting pressure on yourself and pressure is not arousing. My best advice is to just let it be. You may develop stronger sexual desire in the future, you may not. Try to be okay with both of those options. So, what to do in the mean time? If you're not completely repulsed by sex (and be thankful if you're not, some women find their sex drives swinging into full anti-sex mode!), then keep on having sex with your husband with as much enthusiasm as you can muster. Some people are in the camp that you should never have sex unless you are 100% into it, but personally, I've never subscribed to that. I'm rarely 100% into doing a lot of the necessary stuff I do (work, chores, maintenance) but I do it anyway because it's important to continuing to enjoy all the other parts of my life. Keeping your sexual partner happy is emotional maintenance that you can choose to do because you appreciate everything else your partner contributes to your shared lives and it's your way of taking care of him. If it's important to him, and not painful/repulsive/unpleasant for you, then go ahead and keep doing it even if it feels obligatory.On that note, most guys are okay with replacing full penetrative sex with more frequent blowjobs and handjobs. If that's easier for you and still gets his needs met, you might want to start doing them more often. I do this a lot myself when my husband has had a rough day and clearly needs some release but I don't really feel like getting it on myself; it's a nice low-energy activity that he really enjoys, and he doesn't have to know that I'm actually thinking about a work assignment or a new craft project while I'm doing it. ;3 Lastly, if you have a hard time talking about this... welcome to the internet! Anonymity is a wonderful thing. Make some sockpuppet accounts, find you some sympathetic ladyfriends, (hello!) and go ahead and lay it all out. Sometimes it can be easier talking to complete strangers than it is to talk to those close to us, knowing that nothing is at stake and you can ghost off without consequence if you feel uncomfortable. On that note, if you do need someone to talk to, go ahead and drop me a line.

Boob 'tweeks' do happen occasionally without sexual intent. They kind of stick out. I'm not saying he is a great guy, but this kind of thing is NOTHING like something who's made a career/habit of imposing themselves on women.  I also don't think some actor not doing everything they can to stop alleged sexual harassment from their boss is comparable either. That's not the same as covering up abuse or a pattern or abuse. The biggest issue beside the sexual invasion, is these guys are in positions of power over people and using them to GET AWAY with that. You don't even have to sexually touch someone to use their employment over them to have a significant chance of influencing them, especially younger people. That doesn't seem the case here at all.I would have to say, one boob tweak does not a dirty dog make. Getting on Affleck for denouncing sexual ABUSE by pointing out one time his hand touched sometimes boob, doesn't seem entirely honest.It wreaks of media issue pandering to me. By pretending Affleck's single action is the same as a pattern of abuse by people in professional relationships, is doing an injustice to the real problem, which is men in positions of power ROUTINELY abusing that power and getting away with it. Also, a lot of them and their buddies have influence in the media, which means it's easy to generate false equivalencies. Affleck didn't appear to be trying to get away with anything, he was on camera when this all happened. It's not even close to the same I suspect, but I certainly don't know Ben Affleck either.**Don't be suckered into mob mentality, crimes are rarely equal.
