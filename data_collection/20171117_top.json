I referred to this as a 'rape,' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\"A former Trump business associate, Jill Harth, claimed in a 1997 lawsuit the New York real estate mogul \u201cattempted rape\u201d and groped her without her consent on various occasions.

Isn't that the whole point of what's going on in the movie biz, for example? Clear out all of the scum. Don't just leave the ones that favored your policies but rid all of the people who commit sexual abuse (of which this person sexually assaulted someone, something not to say lightly of).>Donald Trump was caught on tape crudely admitting to both of those transgressions, and we made him our president.Two wrongs don't make a right.> if we set this precedent in the interest of demonstrating our party\u2019s solidarity with harassed and abused women, we\u2019re only going to drain the swamp of people who, however flawed, still regularly vote to protect women\u2019s rights and freedoms.How is that remotely true? Shouldn't we set the policy and then everybody has to follow? For example, we know Moore did really terrible things. But if we brush aside Franken's transgressions then we are basically saying \"since everybody's doing it there's no problem.\"The author's argument hinges on the supposed fact that only people who support women will be the ones exposed. But when has that ever been true? Right now we're seeing people who've been public jackasses to everyone, especially women, exposed (i.e. Weinstein). Republican celebrities have been outed, some very recently like Bill O'Reilly. The argument made here is utterly inconsistent with reality.>But if the short-term \u201cright thing\u201d leads to long-term political catastrophe for American women, I think we need to reconsider our definition of the right thing.It won't. Franken's state is solidly blue. The Democrat governor could easily appoint someone else who is a Democrat. The true catastrophe is if Democrats decide that sexual assault doesn't matter, kind of like they did in the 90's when they shrugged off Bill Clinton's actions. The true problem of the Democrat party is that people don't vote because they think it is no different from the recognized problematic establishment of the Republican party. Not holding one's self accountable sets up an immediate backlash from the party, likely leading to losses in every upcoming election.>After all that, I would like to see him support a qualified progressive woman, who will carry on that important work, to run for his seat.So earlier on, our author decided that Franken needed to stay for the absolute need of his party, principles be damned. Here, our author throws away the need of the party for unreasonable principles: even if Minnesota has men who are more easily electable than women she demands a woman run anyway. So, rather than taking the more obvious, more principled route that would secure a Democrat for the future of Minnesota our author takes a less obvious, less principled, more irrational route that leads to no certain place for Democrats in the state.>Don\u2019t just apologize and drop out of sight. Do penance.I agree with this in principle. One problem with today's harassment accusations is that the media and public at large proscribe the same punishment: \"quit your job and don't ever talk again\" For lighter wrongs, I think this punishment is absurd.But does that qualify for Franken? Do we really want someone who sexually assaults women to have a job with so much power? I would think not. Franken should be in jail for what he did, not with the power to literally determine the laws for what such offenses are.>One more empty apology and resignation, one more head on a pike, will not make American women safer or better off.I disagree. Men do these assaults in part because they know they can get away with it. They should be severely punished and nobody who transgresses should get away with what they did merely because of their clout.Men absolutely need to be punished for what they have done and just because the author has some positive feelings to this person's voting pattern does not mean that they should get a lighter sentence.

I referred to this as a 'rape,' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\"A former Trump business associate, Jill Harth, claimed in a 1997 lawsuit the New York real estate mogul \u201cattempted rape\u201d and groped her without her consent on various occasions. In the suit, Harth described a violent encounter at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, in which Trump allegedly threw her against the wall of one of his children\u2019s bedrooms before lifting up her dress.It was a shocking thing to have him do this, because he knew I was with George [her partner], he knew they were in the next room,\" she recalled in an October 2016 interview with The Guardian. \"How could he be doing this when I'm there for business?\"In the pre-election interview, Harth maintained her allegations against Trump despite having withdrawn her lawsuit against him after he settled a separate suit her partner filed over a business dispute.Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and top aide, defended him against Ivana Trump\u2019s claims, saying, \"**By the very definition, you can't rape your spouse.**\"The president has also been accused of sexual harassment or assault by at least 16 women.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 1741, "comment_id": "dpyqyyk", "score": 185, "submission_time": "Fri Nov 17 19:45:27 2017", "ups": 185}, {"body": "Why Franken did was stupid but not deviant.He was playing his hands NEAR her Kevlar covered breasts, and taking a picture *because he wasn't trying to do a deviant act, onlyy funny*.This is the \"too far\" that I feared our current sex talk fad is going.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 979, "comment_id": "dpytosw", "score": 121, "submission_time": "Fri Nov 17 20:31:31 2017", "ups": 121}, {"body": "He did a stupid thing as a joke.

If you're on tribal lands you get $34.95 subsidy  instead of $9.953. **Self-certification** for tribal residency is being **abused** (one reseller signed up more Tribal customers in Hawaii than there were Tribal residents)4. Removes \u201cport freeze\u201d rule that allows providers to **lock-in** Lifeline customers for a year when providing broadband service5. You have to actually **build infrastructure** on Tribal lands to qualify for Lifelines tribal subsidiesOne important ramification of this is that satellite no longer qualifies (see [Clyburn's dissent](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1116/DOC-347792A3.pdf)) for Lifelines subsidies on tribal lands, because satellite generally doesn't build infrastructure on tribal lands... but if this is were allowed then nobody is ever gonna build on tribal lands. The purpose of the subsidy is to encourage actual **broadband development** on tribal lands.If I understand correctly, poor people can still get $9.95 subsidy, but not the $34.95 subsidy, which was leading to  [almost free cell phones in Tulsa](http://www.newson6.com/story/19914572/oklahoma-is-ground-zero-for-government-cell-phone-fraud).", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 42723, "comment_id": "dpyvyw9", "score": 29, "submission_time": "Fri Nov 17 21:10:15 2017", "ups": 29}, {"body": "Jokes on them.

[Source](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-russian-mobster-tokhtakhounov-miss-universe-moscow)-   **3/21/2017 -** Russian mafia boss still at large after FBI wiretap at Trump    Tower.For two years ending in 2013, the FBI had a court-approved warrant to    eavesdrop on a sophisticated Russian organized crime money-laundering    network that operated out of unit 63A in Trump Tower in New York.    [Source](http://abcnews.go.com/US/story-fbi-wiretap-russians-trump-tower/story?id=46266198)-   **3/28/2017 -** Trump's business network reached alleged Russian mobsters.    [Source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/03/28/trump-business-past-ties-russian-mobsters-organized-crime/98321252/)-   **4/4/2017 -** Trump called for a toast at a birthday party of a member of    the Russian mob. \"The owners were from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and    it was the birthday of one of them, Tofik Arifov(Tevfik Arif), a former    Soviet official turned real estate developer with offices in Manhattan\u2019s    Trump Tower.\"    [Source](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article142584709.html)-   **7/17/2017 -** But even if Trump has no memory of the many deals that he    and his business made with Russian investors, he certainly did not \u201cstay    away\u201d from Russia. For decades, he and his organization have aggressively    promoted his business there, seeking to entice investors and buyers for some    of his most high-profile developments. Whether Trump knew it or not, Russian    mobsters and corrupt oligarchs used his properties not only to launder vast    sums of money from extortion, drugs, gambling, and racketeering, but even as    a base of operations for their criminal activities. In the process, they    propped up Trump\u2019s business and enabled him to reinvent his image. Without    the Russian mafia, it is fair to say, Donald Trump would not be president of    the United States.

The systems failed to comply with the basic binding human rights standards in the treatment of children and young people,\u201d the report said.It upheld shocking allegations raised during the 12 weeks of public hearings, including verbal abuse, physical control, inappropriate force and restraint, and the bribing or daring of children to carry out humiliating or degrading acts, or to commit violence against one another.\u201cChildren and young people were subjected to regular, repeated and distressing mistreatment in detention and there was a failure to follow the procedures and requirements of the law in many instances,\u201d the commissioners said.\u201cThese things happened on our watch, in our country, to our children.\u201dThe commission revealed it had referred a number of matters to police, including potential criminal conduct by youth justice officers, the harassment or threatening of witnesses or potential witnesses, and the physical, sexual and neglectful abuse of children in out-of-home residential care settings.We must stop punishing children for a disadvantaged start in lifeAlison ElliottRead moreThe NT government has three months to deliver a plan for closing Don Dale \u2013 a widely criticised centre that previously housed maximum security adult prisoners until they were transferred because it was no longer suitable for habitation. The isolated high security unit cells should be closed immediately, the report said, describing them as:\u201cwholly inappropriate, oppressive, prison-like environment that is detrimental to [the] health, wellbeing and prospects of rehabilitation\u201d of detainees.Among more than 230 recommendations the commission called for:    The age of criminal responsibility to be raised to 12 and the detention of under-14s to be banned except for serious crimes.    A commissioner for children and young people to be given free access to detention centres and detainees.    The use of force to maintain \u201cgood order\u201d and any use of teargas to be banned.    Policies of isolation, bail, body searches and transfers to be overhauled.Recommendations for the child protection sector included:    The development of a 10-year generational strategy for children and families.    The establishment of a network of at least 20 family support centres across the NT.    The phasing out of purchased home-based care and vast improvements to out-of-home care.    Working with Aboriginal organisations to achieve an increase in kinship care placements for Indigenous children.There are currently 35 children in Don Dale, including 23 on remand and six who are under the age of 14.The stories you need to read, in one handy emailRead moreThe four-volume report of more than 2,100 pages detailed a litany of failures and errors, as well as potential and actual breaches of law and international human rights standards. It targeted every level of authority, including police and executives, and ministers from the Labor and CLP governments.\u201cSenior executives and the management and staff at the detention centres implemented and/or maintained and/or tolerated a detention system seemingly intent on \u2018breaking\u2019 rather than \u2018rehabilitating\u2019 the children and young people in their care,\u201d it said.The absence of up-to-date standard operating procedures was attributed to the former corrections commissioner Ken Middlebrook and, for a limited period, Salli Cohen.Frequent understaffing from 2010 resulted in officers \u2013 who, the report noted, had minimal or no training \u2013 being overworked \u201cwith potentially dangerous consequences\u201d.It made specific findings against individual guards, including Conan Zamolo, who filmed detainees inappropriately on at least three occasions and \u201clikely made a recording of a detainee while he was in the shower\u201d, Derek Tasker, who \u201cput his hand or hands around the throat of detainees on three occasions\u201d, and Trevor Hansen, who used the \u201cwedgie\u201d restraint technique against children.The recommendations also appeared to address concerns raised by the former NT justice minister John Elferink about male circumcision, calling for a forum of boys, advocates, elders and leaders to review any ceremonial practice which affected the health of boys.The findings and recommendations come at the end of a 10-month royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory. It acknowledged the \u201cprofound shift\u201d it was proposing for NT authorities, but said it was necessary given the system to date had continued to \u201csimply fail the entire community\u201d.\u201cThe time for tinkering around the edges and ignoring the conclusions of the myriad of inquiries that have already been conducted must come to an end.\u201cWhat we have found is disturbing on many levels, not least of course because it has occurred on our watch and in our count,\u201d White and Gooda said on the eve of the report\u2019s release.The royal commission uncovered deep-seated and confronting problems in Australia \u201cthat come at an enormous human and financial cost,\u201d they said.\u201cNeither will be sustainable for the NT in the short term.\u201dWhite and Gooda said their recommended changes to the youth justice and detention system would deliver savings of $335.5m by 2027.Conversely, \u201cdoing nothing\u201d would result in last financial year\u2019s costs of $37.3m increasing to $113.4m by 2027. The main driver of that cost blowout would be to continue using existing facilities, they said.NT chief minister Michael Gunner said the report was a story of the NT government\u2019s failure to care about and protect children who needed it most.NT youth detention horrors emerge as commission concludes hearingsRead more\u201cIt will live as a stain on the Northern Territory reputation,\u201d he said in a speech on Friday morning. \u201cFor this I am sorry. But more than this I\u2019m sorry for the stories that live in the children we failed.\u201dHe said the government had received the report only that morning and needed time to consider it, but he believed it shared \u201cthe same vision\u201d. He said the government had already begun improvements with its sweeping justice reforms and housing package.In its report the commission said many of the reforms were positive, but there continued to be \u201ctroubling incidents still occurring\u201d in NT detention centers.The royal commission was called after the ABC broadcast disturbing footage from inside the Don Dale detention centre and Darwin adult prison, of children being mistreated, beaten, restrained, and teargassed. It brought long running concerns to Canberra.The commission received more than 480 witness statements, more than 320 submissions and heard from more than 210 witnesses in 12 weeks of public hearings.Bureaucratic witnesses described a failed system that could not keep up with the volume of child protection reports, could not guarantee protection of those children, and at times covered things up.Corrections witnesses revealed a detention system without sense or accountability. Guards were inadequately trained and got away with abhorrent alleged acts.Juvenile witnesses \u2013 all of whom with the exception of Dylan Voller testified in private \u2013 spoke of the upbringing and poor decisions that landed them in detention, the horrors they endured there and what needed to change.Ministerial witnesses described challenges trying to fix a broken system without cabinet support, of taking the initiative themselves without expertise of their own or seeking advice from others.

Within living memory it was not uncommon for girls in the US to marry as young as 13, and completely normal for 16-17 year olds to marry. I'm not in any way advocating that teens that young should be having sex or getting married, but the reality is that many, if not most people are sexually active before they are legally allowed. It's not uncommon for senior boys in high school to date freshmen girls, and for those relationships to be sexual. I think we really need to look more closely at our laws regarding minors and sexual activity and try to bring some consistency into play. If that means raising the age of consent, reevaluating what we consider to be statutory rape, or just acknowledging the absurdity of labeling someone as a sex offender because their consensual partner hadn't crossed some arbitrary chronological milestone. I totally agree that teachers or people in positions of authority shouldn't be having sexual relationships with their students, but aside from that I have a hard time justifying how easily people throw around terms like pedophile and child abuser in cases where the age difference is relatively small, both parties are past the age of consent, but they fail into the realm of statutory rape due to the inconsistencies in our laws.I think by screaming rape, child abuse and pedophile in cases of older teens being sexually active with young adults, we are muddying the waters regarding \"actual\" pedophilia and child sexual abuse, and generally diluting the meaning of the terms. We have decided as a culture and as a society of laws what ages and under what circumstances people are legally allowed to be sexually active with one another, but we haven't really addressed the fact that many young teens, and just teens in general have always had sex and always will. By spending our time and resources regulating biologically intrinsic behavior in people who are physically sexually mature, we are taking away time and resources that could be spent tracking down those who the laws are really intended to punish - legitimate pedophiles engaging in sexual activities with children who are not physically sexually mature and not mentally or legally capable of consent.For the record, my late wife was raped as a child by two teenage boys, and I have a 17 year old daughter for whom I would gladly kill if she were sexually (or otherwise) abused in any way. I do not take anything about this topic lightly - I just feel like the growing ease with which we throw around terms like pedophile and (statutory) rapist is not really doing much to help things and may even be taking the focus off of the truly helpless young victims we want to protect by trying to make biologically normal behavior illicit. TL;DR - pedophiles and rapists suck, but let's be careful throwing those terms around in cases like this because our laws are not very consistent with the actual behavior of most teens and young adults.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 874, "comment_id": "dpyrmg9", "score": 72, "submission_time": "Fri Nov 17 19:56:20 2017", "ups": 72}, {"body": "I am 19 years old and I can say with 100% certainty that I absolutely wanted at least three of my highschool teachers to \"rape\" me as hard as they fucking could and I did try to let that be known to one of them and if I could go back in time and try again I would.The fact that it's considered rape to have sex with a 17 year old when kids are fucking eachother at 14 and 15 is absolutely retarded. One day's difference and an imaginary number doesn't make your ability to consent any more or less real. People develop at different speeds and reach maturity at different ages. Everyone who thinks this woman is a \"pedophile child molester criminal\" is either jealous that they don't get pussy like that, or they're jealous that she's hot and she gets all sorts of dick. I will agree that it is wrong to have a relationship with a student because that breaches the dynamic of student to instructor, and she definetly should lose her job, but she shouldn't be put in prison.

Russian trolls are on reddit, and they sure as hell brigade certain articles and posts, especially ones that have to do with feminism, race relations, the DNC, etc.    2. /r/T_D also brigades the same posts as the Russians naturally (though there is often some light suggestion of brigading on the /r/T_D, but not enough to outright ban the sub) doubling the conservative voices.         3. Reddit is 2/3 male, 70% white and disproportionately involved in STEM fields [according to a 2016 gallup survey](http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/). This means the vast majority of legitimate users took a minimum of courses in the humanities and social science departments and there are very few people with formal education in these fields on reddit. Ccomments getting upvoted on topics such as history, philosophy, current events, politics, sociology, feminism, etc are being pushed there by fairly uninformed people outside of the world of science and technology and much more homogenous group than it would appear, despite reddit's large user base.            So ya, reddit is a great source of information, but you have to know how to use it. This means ignoring upvotes/downvotes and also read entire comment threads. Here is a great examples from the [Trump  building in Panama has Russian Mafia Ties](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7dlho2/trump_building_in_panama_tied_to_russian_mafia/) article that is currently on the front page:        This is the third most upvoted top level comment about how this whole thing is a baseless smear against Trump:          >From a quick look in the article:The Reuters and NBC News investigation said it found no indication that the Trump family or the Trump Organization engaged in any illegal activity or know of the backgrounds of people who did have links to organized crime.+The Trump Organization does not own the hotel, but rather licenses the Trump name to the project in order to boost sales.So now you say, holy shit liberals on reddit. Way to make another idiotic attack of Trump proving what the right says about liberal bubbles and their media actively trying to undermine the Trump administration. Shows you that both sides are just as bad!           Except, here is a reply to that comment that has only a fraction of the upvotes:           >Talk about picking and choosing. The part in between those two block quotes that you conveniently cut out reads :>>Still, legal experts contacted by Reuters for the story said Trump should have asked those questions.Because Panama is \u201cperceived to be highly corrupt,\u201d said Arthur Middlemiss, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan and a former head of JPMorgan\u2019s global anti-corruption program, those who do business there should perform due diligence on others involved in their ventures.If they fail to do so, he told Reuters, they risk being liable under U.S. law of being found having turned a blind eye to wrongdoing.    >The article goes on to describe the salesman for the Trump hotel:>>Ventura, according to the report, had a \"challenge\" with Ivanka Trump over whether he could sell 100 of the units in the building. If he succeeded, she would name him the lead sales rep for the project.\u201cThe agreement was, I had a week to sell 100 units,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m going to do better, I\u2019m going to sell without telling (the buyers) the price.\u201dVentura ended up selling the units, and eventually ended up appearing alongside Trump in a video promoting the project. He was also photographed with President Trump himself.Several of those units were sold to David Murcia Guzm\u00e1n, the founder of a large Colombian marketing company. Guzm\u00e1n now sits in a U.S. jail cell, awaiting extradition to Colombia after being convicted of laundering money for drug cartels.In fact, some of the units seemed to be sold several times. Once the project was completed, complaints began arising that Ventura double- or triple-sold units and that several customers \"ran into each other.\"\u201cWhen the building was completed and people arrived to seek out their apartments, they ran into each other \u2014 two, three people who were fighting for the same apartment,\" said a former lawyer for Ventura.Now, Ventura is a fugitive from justice in Panama, where he told Reuters an arrest warrant is still waiting for him. He is under a federal investigation for international money laundering, and admitted to laundering money for corrupt Panamanian politicians. In 2009, he was arrested on fraud charges related to the project.       In other words, Trump is culpable for having failed to property investigate a business deal he entered into. This is not a nothing burger, and is in fact a fairly damning article on Trump that he is willfully negligent in his business dealings, yet there is no highly upvoted response comment pointing this out.             **TL;DR:** upvotes are meaningless, read all comments as possibly equally valid, and always read a ton of responses to any comment you agree or disagree with.
