Russia has expended significant resources trying to interfere the political process of (to name a few): Estonia, Poland, Germany, France, the UK, the US, and Spain. This included active measures like setting up front groups and impersonating/ buying off native activists to exploit tensions. It's not that Putin was merely noting these tensions, *his efforts were specifically meant to exacerbate them through lies and disinformation.* Societies cannot solve these problems when such efforts are successful, which impacts the success of these countries overall. The truth is, Western powers are only now beginning to engage with Russia on these fronts. (The invasion of Ukraine is another data point to support Russian engagement of Cold War 2.0).>\u201cHe certainly does not run Russia outside the inner beltway of Moscow. The pact that he has with those people who actually do run the various regions of the country is a rather simple one: You bring out the level of vote that I need for my purposes, and I let you do what you want to do in your region. That\u2019s how it works, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work in these upcoming elections.\u201dAnother bit of disinformation/distraction. Nobody is saying that Putin runs the day to day at the local DMV. But if Putin really wanted to keep an individual from getting a driver's license it's pretty clear that person would have a hard time getting one. None of the oligarchs are in their position in spite of Putin and throughout his reign he's made it very clear that he can take all their power away at his discretion by nationalizing their companies or just throwing them in jail. His power is pretty much absolute there.Outside Russia the article has a valid point, that Russia isn't as powerful as it's often portrayed. It's economy is crappy and resource dependent, he's a pariah on the world stage, and the only reason their military is taken seriously is because of all the nukes they have left over from Cold War 1.0. But it's precisely that which makes Putin and Russia dangerous. The only way Russia becomes a great power again with Putin at the helm is to have the liberal international framework stood up after WWII to collapse on itself, of which the US is the lynchpin. Then brute force and the threat of nukes becomes a much more effective from of power. Otherwise, to become a power Russia would have to adopt free elections, basic human rights, and move away from a blatant kleptocracy.

Russia has expended significant resources trying to interfere the political process of (to name a few): Estonia, Poland, Germany, France, the UK, the US, and Spain. This included active measures like setting up front groups and impersonating/ buying off native activists to exploit tensions. It's not that Putin was merely noting these tensions, *his efforts were specifically meant to exacerbate them through lies and disinformation.* Societies cannot solve these problems when such efforts are successful, which impacts the success of these countries overall. The truth is, Western powers are only now beginning to engage with Russia on these fronts. (The invasion of Ukraine is another data point to support Russian engagement of Cold War 2.0).>\u201cHe certainly does not run Russia outside the inner beltway of Moscow. The pact that he has with those people who actually do run the various regions of the country is a rather simple one: You bring out the level of vote that I need for my purposes, and I let you do what you want to do in your region. That\u2019s how it works, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work in these upcoming elections.\u201dAnother bit of disinformation/distraction. Nobody is saying that Putin runs the day to day at the local DMV. But if Putin really wanted to keep an individual from getting a driver's license it's pretty clear that person would have a hard time getting one. None of the oligarchs are in their position in spite of Putin and throughout his reign he's made it very clear that he can take all their power away at his discretion by nationalizing their companies or just throwing them in jail. His power is pretty much absolute there.Outside Russia the article has a valid point, that Russia isn't as powerful as it's often portrayed. It's economy is crappy and resource dependent, he's a pariah on the world stage, and the only reason their military is taken seriously is because of all the nukes they have left over from Cold War 1.0. But it's precisely that which makes Putin and Russia dangerous. The only way Russia becomes a great power again with Putin at the helm is to have the liberal international framework stood up after WWII to collapse on itself, of which the US is the lynchpin. Then brute force and the threat of nukes becomes a much more effective from of power. Otherwise, to become a power Russia would have to adopt free elections, basic human rights, and move away from a blatant kleptocracy.

However, what distinguishes a situation like this from that hypothetical is: 1) I'm in a position to judge my friend's credibility since I know them personally.  I know nothing about the person making this claim. and2) If my friend were to specifically accuse a person and say, for example, \"Michael Davis stole my bike\", I'm pretty sure that I  *would* ask them \"How do you know that this person stole it?\"  It would probably be one of the first few questions I asked.  When a person accuses a specific person - particularly publicly names them - there should be *some* standard of proof, shouldn't there?  Even if we assume that only 1 out of 100 public claims made are false, shouldn't we require *some* level of substantiation?I don't want to live in a world where claims of assault are summarily dismissed or discouraged and lives are ruined without proper recourse.

The first indication of his capture was a Low-Level Voice Intercept of an unidentified male talking about an American soldier with a camera looking for someone who speaks English.  This communication was intercepted by a Guardrail signals intelligence aircraft, which used direction finding to determine the location of the transmission.  It was about 9.8 miles to the south-southeast from Mest, in totally the wrong direction Bergdahl would have to head in order to get back to his unit at Sharana FOB.His lawyers claim he got turned around in the mountains, which is a bunch of hooey because there were no mountains of any significance between where he was stationed and where he was captured, and Bergdahl was known for taking long multi-day hikes by himself back in the mountains of Northern Idaho where he grew up:https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/us/many-sharp-turns-in-bergdahls-path-to-army.html>Although his home life was strict, Sergeant Bergdahl was given a long leash by his parents to explore Idaho on foot or bike or motorcycle, and was taught to be self-sufficient. **\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone from Blaine County who could take a compass and a knife and walk off into the mountains to survive on squirrels, it was Bowe,\u201d one friend said.**...>\u201cHe was a seeker,\u201d said Sue Martin, the owner of Zaney\u2019s River Street Coffee House in Hailey, where Sergeant Bergdahl worked as a barista.** He asked for, and received, special dispensation to disappear for days, on a bike ride, a hike, or some other journey. **He had a compass with him when he walked away from Mest OP.  I find it difficult to believe he got \"turned around\" and lost, him having the experience he did solo hiking and otherwise journeying through the mountains near Hailey and Ketchum, ID.I think he was flat-out deserting.  If you extend the line from Mest OP through the grid square where he was caught by the Taliban, you'll see it leads to a river valley that is the only practical way to travel into Pakistan on foot.  It's about a 92 mile hike that way to get over the border, most of it in that valley.  The closest point is about 30 miles away from Mest OP, which would probably be a couple days walk for him.  After that, he'd have access to water, and navigation would have been simple:  Follow the river downstream until you get to the border.A couple of maps to illustrate what I'm talking about:https://imgur.com/a/4PyQT", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 3407, "stickied": false, "score": 12, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 22:54:50 2017", "ups": 12}, {"body": "I think the real punishment should go to whoever decided it was a good idea to ship a guy that got kicked out of the frickin Coast Guard for being screwed up in the head to Iraq.

The first indication of his capture was a Low-Level Voice Intercept of an unidentified male talking about an American soldier with a camera looking for someone who speaks English.  This communication was intercepted by a Guardrail signals intelligence aircraft, which used direction finding to determine the location of the transmission.  It was about 9.8 miles to the south-southeast from Mest, in totally the wrong direction Bergdahl would have to head in order to get back to his unit at Sharana FOB.His lawyers claim he got turned around in the mountains, which is a bunch of hooey because there were no mountains of any significance between where he was stationed and where he was captured, and Bergdahl was known for taking long multi-day hikes by himself back in the mountains of Northern Idaho where he grew up:https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/us/many-sharp-turns-in-bergdahls-path-to-army.html>Although his home life was strict, Sergeant Bergdahl was given a long leash by his parents to explore Idaho on foot or bike or motorcycle, and was taught to be self-sufficient. **\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone from Blaine County who could take a compass and a knife and walk off into the mountains to survive on squirrels, it was Bowe,\u201d one friend said.**...>\u201cHe was a seeker,\u201d said Sue Martin, the owner of Zaney\u2019s River Street Coffee House in Hailey, where Sergeant Bergdahl worked as a barista.** He asked for, and received, special dispensation to disappear for days, on a bike ride, a hike, or some other journey. **He had a compass with him when he walked away from Mest OP.  I find it difficult to believe he got \"turned around\" and lost, him having the experience he did solo hiking and otherwise journeying through the mountains near Hailey and Ketchum, ID.I think he was flat-out deserting.  If you extend the line from Mest OP through the grid square where he was caught by the Taliban, you'll see it leads to a river valley that is the only practical way to travel into Pakistan on foot.  It's about a 92 mile hike that way to get over the border, most of it in that valley.  The closest point is about 30 miles away from Mest OP, which would probably be a couple days walk for him.  After that, he'd have access to water, and navigation would have been simple:  Follow the river downstream until you get to the border.A couple of maps to illustrate what I'm talking about:https://imgur.com/a/4PyQT", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 3407, "stickied": false, "score": 14, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 22:54:50 2017", "ups": 14}], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/bergdahl-sentencing-will-feature-how-desperate-search-changed-3-lives-forever.html", "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "green": 0.2532336414}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": 0.07558750360000001, "top_comments": [{"body": "I am sorry, your title description is a bit misleading.
