Specifically the winter green lifesaver mints. First you have one, thinking hey this is pretty neat. Before you know it, you\u2019re ordering $10 bags of mints from Amazon once a week, you\u2019re popping mints one after another, and you still have enough to hand out to everyone you see at school. You build up a reputation as the Mint Guy and you\u2019ve gained respect from students and teachers because of your mint dealings. Soon enough, your addiction shows its bad side by making your tongue yellow. You try googling why your tongue is yellow, hoping it has nothing to do with the mints. You can\u2019t find anything relating mints and yellow tongue on the internet, but you know deep down that it\u2019s because of your mint addiction. You have to stop eating mints and scrub your tongue with mouthwash for 10 mins everyday. After 5 months, you\u2019re offered a mint. You\u2019ve been clean all this time but you figure one wouldn\u2019t hurt. That one mint lead to another and before you know it your tongue is yellow again, but the mints help you focus. You NEED them. You\u2019re in college now and consider yourself forced to start popping mints again so you could focus on your work, even though you know it\u2019s unhealthy. Only time will tell where this goes, and you pray you find a healthier alternative. Rehab isn\u2019t an option because society doesn\u2019t realize the danger posed by this \u201ccandy\u201d. You just have to come to terms with the fact that you\u2019ll have to scrub your tongue religiously from now on. Don\u2019t do mints, kids. They\u2019ll ruin your life in the long run.Edit: To all the people replying doublemint Dave, I had no idea what you were talking about until I looked it up just now and now I can\u2019t stop laughingEdit 2: To all those who have suffered from mint addictions: know you are not alone. I found that out today too, like there\u2019s a lot of us. Somebody make /r/TheMintMen or /r/MintAddicts a thing cause I\u2019m too lazyEdit 3: So we\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I have oral thrush but is it supposed to come back every time I have a single mint now?Edit 4: I\u2019m just gonna talk a little bit more about my minty experiences. Having a supply of mints was like having a superpower. People would give up their seats for me if I offered them mints and one guy even did some of my homework. I was able to interrupt underclassmen classes and hand out mints to all the students and even the teacher. One of my favorite parts was throwing a mint in the middle of a bunch of kids during lunch and watching them fight over it like scoundrels. When kids asked me about how the mint business was going, I would tell them I\u2019m expecting a new shipment from my supplier in a week. At one point I found out someone else was trying to be a mint guy. Kids would ask me about that and I would tell them that my PRODUCT is higher quality. I eventually confronted the kid and told him I was taking over his business. Whenever he gave out mints, people had to know it was courtesy of ME.

I blurt out \"want to fuck?\" She she pulls down her pants and I enter her from behind and she asked me to cum in her, but I didn't obviously (I'm not a total fucking idiot).  She wants to go to a party and it was only 1am or so at this point, so we call a cab and go to one her friend is throwing.  We get there and their are like three naked chick's and like 15 dudes, some smoking meth/crack, some doing lines, etc.  I pour myself a glass of Makers and try not to judge.  I end up fucking the girl I went with and her topless hot friend in front of the other girl there that was fingering herself, and all of a sudden like 6 or 7 of these guys barge in all spun as fuck and are pissed I'm taking all the women to myself.  A fight breaks out and I'm shitting my pants and get struck a few times and a gun pulled on me.

I came back, and after a year, she broke up with this guy she was dating (who was a fucking idiot and really bad for her), so I took the chance and started talking to her again. She also came to talk to me.  Slowly, we saw each other a few times, but she was still bad about her break up. I was trying my best because, despite I liking her, I wanted her out of her bad relationship with that guy. But she wasn't doing good.  One night we were at a party with her friend, and we were kinda enjoying the moment although the vibe was pretty weird for us. I knew she was still in a bad moment, but was doing my best to help her and make her feel better. Suddenly in the night she started typing into her phone, and changed her mood. I ask her what happened and she didn't want to talk. She goes inside to the bathroom, leaving me with her friend there.

Red light camera. Backstory: My girl of three years decided she needed some time with the girls. Her group of friends were all getting married and falling out of contact. She had been pressuring me to get married, I guess to fit in. I was not ready, but after 5 years of dating I was happy to be in a committed relationship. So I entertained it, let her move in and I bought her a new car, her old one was a shit bucket. So now she has been going out with them pretty consistently. Not a big deal to me because I travel and work a great deal of time.  One day I get a ticket in the mail there is a picture of her and some guy sitting in the passenger seat of the car I bought her. WTF, ok no biggie, lets see what she has to say about this. \"So last time you were out with the girls you told me .... how was it. How is .... I noticed you came in real late are the other husbands boyfriends ok with their girls being out till 4am.\"  She replies, \"we had fun but drank a bit too much so we stayed at ..... house until everyone sobered up. You can call .... we were all there.\"Red flag, she lied. I decided to take a look at the phone logs. I bought her a brand new phone and paid the bill. Sweet there it was, the texts and calls before and after she \"went out with her friends.\" I am not tech savvy but I had just hired a secretary (sec) who was pretty proficient at social media.  My girl was pretty jealous of my new secretary because she was really good looking, going to uni, and sharp. There was no reason at the time because my sec thought I was a \"douche.\" So I asked sec to take a quick look at her posting history for me because I was going to ask her to marry me. I know this was a half-truth but I was sure there was some sort of answer. I thought she must be retarded to throw our relationship away. Ok, my sec came back with tons of information but said she needed passwords. So I gave her the password to the email account I set up for my girl. She changed the passwords to IG and Facebook. It was actually kind of funny because my girl routinely forgot passwords and reset them, like at least once a month. Nothing in the email account but Facebook and IG were full of DM's. Sec asked for more resources, so I gave IT the ok to give her whatever she needed. Basically sec found my girl had been having an affair with a married man for a year and she had about 5 different men trying to be with her. She was flirting and leading them on the whole time. The married man was the only one who knew about me but she made it seem like she was the successful one flashing her purses, car, new phone and clothes. My sec laid it all out. To make things worst he had 3 kids. At this point it was pro-revenge time. So I waited for the exact moment. I visited a jeweler friend of mine and asked him to lend me a 15k ring. I asked her to gather her closest friends for a night, my treat. We drover her car which was a little weird since mine was much nicer. At the beginning of the evening I made it seem like I was going to propose, I got down on one knee but told her that I could not see myself being with her for the rest of my life, I opened the box and let her look at the ring. She got all excited and the girls started to say \"OMG\" is he doing that. At exactly that moment my Sec showed up dressed exquisite looking like a damn model handed me a piece of paper with the guys name, number, address, FB account, and DL#. Which I handed to my soon to be ex girl. She was horrified. I then took my ring put it in my pocket, grabbed my sec, and left in MY car.  Shortly after this happened sec logged into FB one last time. She posted \"So you all know, we broke up because I was cheating on him for a year with a married man.\" I feel like I dodged a bullet! P.S. Pro revenge did not happen, this was what me and my beautiful secretary thought up while laying in bed after getting together shortly after I repoed the car, phone, and kicked her out of my house.

But I hadn't really developed much of an attachment to her.  Well, I'm in class one day and I see her through the window walking with this guy I know, who does not like me one bit for some reason or another.  She gives him a hug goodbye, and it's a bit long.  I tried not to think much of it, just a hug whatever right?  Well, later that night we're out at dinner, just some fast food before we went back to my place, and she gets a text and says she has to bail, because her mom needed her.Now, I'm going to say that I did not in any way mean to follow her or anything.  I think maybe she was just unaware of the timing of things; I hadn't finished my food, she was walking back to her dorms down the road I would take to get home, etc.  I even told her that I'd give her a ride back because it was on my way.  So when I'm driving home, I see her meet up with that guy from before, outside her dorm, and they go up.  Me being mister nosy, I sort of sneak up to her dorm room and see her door slightly cracked.  So I listen, and she's clearly having an orgasm, a loud one.  So I toss open the door and yell \"What the fuck is going on!?\"  It was around that time that I realized she was getting banged by an 8-story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era.  He turned to me and asked me for tree fiddy.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again.

Sometimes I'd try to shimmy up the trunk, other times I would laboriously pull my plastic jungle gym over for use as a step ladder, and on one memorable occasion, I tried to build a staircase out of the waffle-shaped blocks (which were kind of like enormous LEGO bricks) that I'd received for my birthday.This is relevant, I promise.My antics didn't go unnoticed by my parents, who \u2013 though they praised my ingenuity \u2013 told me in no uncertain terms that climbing that tree was a touch too dangerous for me to be doing on a regular basis. The rule became that if I wanted to climb the tree, one of them had to be there watching... and since I viewed my attempts at upward mobility as more of a compulsion than a pastime, I would spend many an afternoon asking for their oversight.Now, my parents were always very attentive, but even they had their limits. One afternoon, after I had asked for an observer's presence while I climbed the tree, my father took me aside and told me that he'd bought a game for me. I mistakenly thought that he meant a *board* game, and thus was very confused when he sat me down in front of the family computer. (My only previous experience with the machine at that point had been the time that my father had told me it was \"alive,\" and then helped me have a conversation with it... through the use of a text-to-speech program.)\"This is a *video* game, Max,\" my father told me. \"You use the mouse to explore. Does that sound like fun?\"\"Can I *climb* in it?\" I asked.My father grinned and nodded. \"You can climb, you can crawl, you can run, you can swim... come have a look!\"I sat down at the computer, and was greeted by a black-and-white image of a manhole cover, along with a predictable title: *The Manhole*. A single click was enough to move it aside, revealing a dark chasm down which \u2013 as promised \u2013 I could climb. From there, I wound up mounting an expedition to all sorts of strange and intriguing locales, including a dragon's cave, a sunken pirate ship, and even an oddly barren birdcage (where the avian who lived there apologized for not having any tea or milk to offer me).It was the start of my first adventure in electronic gaming, and although it was a monumentally simple game \u2013 little more than a slideshow, really \u2013 it got me hooked.Looking back, I suppose you could call that my first level.**TL;DR: I spent a lot of time deep inside a manhole.**", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2852890, "stickied": false, "score": 64, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 18 19:21:56 2017", "ups": 64}, {"body": "Pok\u00e9mon yellow.

I had lost contact with her for several years until I bumped into her working at a hardware store recently.  During her trip at the bottom she had a child as a result of prostituting herself for another fix and ended up going through rehab.

She was someone that I truly loved while we were dating, and I wanted to help with those issues she had but we broke up because she cheated on me and it was a last straw type of moment.

That He was here and told us the very truth of our existence and that because the truth demanded that we admit to being evil and be willing to stop being evil we hated Him and what He had to say. We hated Him so much that we took Him and crucified Him while He loved us so much He was willing to be killed to pay the debt of our sins-that debt being our own eternal, spiritual death in hell. The thought that He then rose from the dead and showed the hope we had to rise from the dead with Him if we followed Him-the thought of coming back to life to a world no longer corrupted by death, suffering, or evil is breathtaking. We accept so blandly the incredible things that Christianity proclaims. Our entire world is numb to the most radical idea that has even graced this world. I believe in Jesus with all my heart, though I used to be a very different man. I was a man that scoffed at those who believed in the message that I have written-I thought men fools who would spend their precious life living for a fantastical story that had no proof. I lived a life seeking satisfaction everywhere it wasn't, specifically in drugs and thrills, and found myself in a place so dark it makes me scared to remember the things I used to think, to remember who I was before I fell on my knees in repentance and confessed Jesus as my Lord. I can't begin to explain to you the joy I have. I can't even begin to tell you what it is like to know your creator. Not just speaking words in the air with my eyes closed, not just reading empty words in a book, but knowing Him. We are all so thirsty for fulfillment in this world and there is fulfillment and it leads to salvation from the hell we so justly deserve and eternal life in paradise. All of you living in Christian cultures know exactly what I'm talking about when I say that there seems to be no one who actually takes this idea of Jesus seriously. I mean can you imagine actually believing this stuff? You'd be floored understanding the things that Christ proclaims in the Bible. Things like an incredible majority of this world-include those identifying as Christians-being condemned to an eternal hell. Things like Jesus coming back at any moment and waging war on this world and those refusing to repent of their evil, destroying cities. Look around you. Do you see anyone in your whole life, anyone you have ever met forsaking their entire lives to spread the gospel and make disciples of all nations? My guess is that you haven't met a single one, though some of you may have met one or two. These are the people who truly believe this message and understand it must be lived by and is worth giving everything for-eternity is at stake. Look around for a second at this idea that permeates our entire world and give it another thought. You aren't living in a country of people that believe in Jesus. You aren't living in a world that loves and follows Him. You are living in a world full of people that yell for His blood to be on them and their children. You live in a world that is entirely under the power of Satan and very few are going to escape with eternal life out of this place. Repent of your sin and believe the gospel. Find a church that actually spreads the gospel, makes disciples, and stands on the Bible as utterly true and authoritative. Many of you are misled in churches that simply hold service on Sunday-this is exactly what Satan wants. These ideas are exactly what is proclaimed by Christianity, and it blows my mind every day. It blows my mind that everyone can walk around in a culture that is bored and numb to these ideas like it's nothing.

After a small amount of time, the excited molecule falls back to a lower energy state and at this point it emits a photon.It is this process of photon emission by excited molecules of the background gas that is responsible for essentially all the visible light in a discharge event (such as lightning).

Locally, we can look at transition lines of elements like hydrogen and helium and magnesium and iron, etc, in a star's atmosphere and compare them to their energies in a lab to determine radial velocities. When we describe a star's color as being \"red\" or \"blue\" due to temperature, we aren't talking about atomic lines being redshifted or blueshifted, but the relative amounts of light in broad bandpasses that changes with temperature. This \"broad-band photometry\" is easier to do than spectroscopy, just because you have more photons to work with. Instead of measuring an atomic line at 656.3 nm relative to continuum at 656.5 nm, you just lump all the light from e.g. 600-700nm together into one big bucket and call it \"red\". Locally, stars aren't moving fast enough for these colors to be impacted by their velocity. It *is* possible to measure redshifts of distant galaxies with broad-band photometry, though, but it's cheating a bit because it's making use of a particularly dramatic atomic feature, the Lyman break of hydrogen. Photometric redshifts are done by measuring the light in several broad bandpasses and fitting where the Lyman break is happening (i.e. what wavelength sees the light suddenly go dim). They aren't as accurate as spectroscopic redshifts, but they exist and are easier to do for faint galaxies.

Absolutely, even if I disagree with the premise and side with those who protest. However, you can make an argument that the Presidents actions influenced the decisions of NFL owners; but I do not believe that is a proper avenue. Kaepernick should be in the league, he's proven himself as a viable athlete, and one that can easily fill the roles when a QB is injured (Like maybe Rodgers?). If you can make an argument for Ryan Fitzpatrick to be in the league, but not a super bowl appearing QB in Kaepernick, then I feel people are overlooking dominant factors. Edit/Addition: * In my honest view, if people would just stop and listen to why players are protesting [because it's not to disrespect the military; but then again idk how kneeling for the flag is disrespectful when service members serve, fight, and die to preserve your right to sit, stand or kneel without subjugation] then I feel this entire ordeal would be remedied far quicker than if we choose to let it divide us on ideologies. * If those who are offended by the gesture of kneeling for the flag listen, and if we act to make our society more inclusive for all Americans, then only at that point will we truly be honoring what the American flag is to represent: freedom, equality, liberty and justice.

It made it look all so staged and fake, sorry, \"scripted\" \ud83d\ude44, with the same kind of horseshit production quality  every TV network reality series does now. At this point you can't  tell what's  the truth in what really happened  in sequence , from start to finish in each battle , and that's  awful since it takes all the fun, suspense and \"magic\" away.  That's a shame because  you can absolutely  see the passion and dedication  on both teams and the amount  of time it took to get to that point. The show cheapened  their  effort.  I can't describe it exactly  but I hated it. Id like to see a more \"raw\" footage style of it. If the same production company handles the next one, I won't  bother to watch even as a big mech scifi fan. If it's  going to be done, cut the BS and do it right! Plus, wtf, it was on Twitch of all places. It didn't  need to be so awfully  edited and quick. Could've  easily  just let it play out in real time or close enough. That's  a huge advantage  of a platform  like that.

As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was \"sweetheart\". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. Second semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the \"boss\" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an \"us\" against \"them\" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: \"if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else\". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the \"jokes\" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that \"some doctors\" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had \"friends\" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. One day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, \"so Coach is like...a creep, right?\" The response was essentially \"yeah, you didn't know?\" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of \"Girls ask Guys\". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say \"pass\". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.

I'm Cora. I'm an artist and writer currently working on a zine about sexual harassment in the workplace, and am seeking relevant personal stories to share in the zine. I want to hear your answers to this question: \"How has workplace sexual harassment affected you?\" HOW TO SHARE YOUR STORYI know this is a sensitive and painful subject, and I appreciate so much that you are willing to talk about it. Let me know how I can best respect your needs in this. I'm happy to answer any questions you have. The format is quite open-ended\u2014write a few sentences or several paragraphs, and include whatever level of detail you're comfortable with. All stories included in the zine will be shared on a strictly anonymous basis, no names of any kind will be attached. Feel free to either answer the question in comments, or send me a private message if that's more comfortable. I reserve the right to leave out any stories that don't seem appropriate for the work, although I don't imagine I'll want to. Anyone who contributes to the zine and would like a free copy will get one (I'll contact you when it's complete to ask for a mailing address).MORE INFO ABOUT THE PROJECTBecause of a harassment complaint and subsequent backlash from my previous employer earlier this year, I ended up doing a lot of research around sexual harassment. I also had a lot of friends reach out to me with stories of their own harassment. I was horrified to realize that the problem is much more rampant than I'd known, particularly in the restaurant industry. I learned a lot about how to navigate these situations in the future, but was very concerned by how difficult it was for me to find that information\u2014I want to make it more accessible to more people. I want to create a guide on sexual harassment that is engaging and personal and realistic, one that's super cheap to produce and distribute, one that is quick and easy to read (instead of a daunting wall of legal jargon). The zine will be about how to navigate harassment situations, but I'd also like a large portion of it to be personal stories from people like you, that shed light on the magnitude of the problem and its many faces. I've been struggling to find the time and energy for this project for months. The recent #MeToo posts from my friends have rekindled my creative fury and reminded me of why this is so important.Please note that there is no length, or level of severity, or any other qualification that your story needs to meet in order to be valuable for this. If it didn't happen to you but is something you witnessed or helped someone else through, even if you don't know whether it legally counts as sexual harassment\u2014if it feels relevant and you feel compelled to share, then I would love to hear from you.Thanks so much for reading this and for your help with this project!-Cora", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "77537m", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "OPEN CALL FOR STORIES: \"How has workplace sexual harassment affected you?\"", "num_comments": 0, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 3, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/77537m/open_call_for_stories_how_has_workplace_sexual/", "submission_time": "Wed Oct 18 11:40:54 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/77537m/open_call_for_stories_how_has_workplace_sexual/", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "That\u2019s exactly it.. your friend thinks men SHOULDNT need to see it but the truth is; some do need to see it.

I've seen a lot of writing that goes beyond \"sharing a story\" and gives lots of insight into victim blaming, supporting victims of assault, how to help women (or anyone else!) who you see being harassed, and how to curb problematic behavior or thoughts you might have and understand others perspectives. I also have seem some great articles that the campaign has spurred with facts, stats, and further information about harassment and assault in the US and how society can work to prevent violence, get bad people out of positions of power, and in general be a better support system for survivors.My friend on the other hand hates this campaign. She believes it is ridiculous and that men shouldn't need to see stories and hashtags on their feed to understand the problem the country has with harassment and assault. She also thinks the campaign is not inclusive: while it is now being posted and used by men and members of the LGBT community, it was originally intended for women writing about harassment they experienced at the hands of men. At the end of the day, she thinks having women recount their stories does more harm than good and won't change the opinions of anyone.I don't necessarily think that either of us is right or wrong, or that there is an definitive answer of whether this campaign \"works.\" I really just would love to hear what your thoughts are and if you think the campaign is positive, negative, helpful, or harmful.

While that world could be full of amazing opportunities, its history is marred by an track record of systematic, widespread inequality directed at women:&nbsp;Women still make far less than their male counterparts. Female incarceration rates have skyrocketed. Our foster care system is in need of a major overhaul and is, all too often, used as a pipeline to sex trafficking for women and young girls. From Cosby to Weinstein, one look at the news today will show you how prevalent sexual assault is in our society. Police departments nationwide are woefully undertrained to handle domestic violence situations and the courts often don\u2019t enforce standards fairly in urban and rural areas. And of course, reproductive healthcare is under constant attack. Far from fading away into the history books, the war on women seems to be kicking into high gear.&nbsp;Women\u2019s rights are used as tokens daily, but their rights are not bargaining chips. Women must be represented as a whole, not through the lens of single issues.&nbsp;They shouldn\u2019t have to fight for access to birth control while corporations systematically employ wage discrimination policies aimed to increase corporate profits.&nbsp;For my daughters, and all our daughters, there is hope on the horizon. We must fight for the future they will inherit.&nbsp;The Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified - meaning women have no guarantee of equal protection under the Constitution. But it\u2019s close. Only two states remain for its passage. What\u2019s more: there\u2019s precedent for a long, but successful, ratification. The 27th Amendment took more than 200 years to pass!&nbsp;The ERA will not solve all our problems, but it would be a giant boost of momentum to help guarantee a world where our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters and friends are treated with equal respect, dignity and opportunity under the law. In Congress, I will fight to ensure its passage.&nbsp;Look for documentary screenings, town halls, blog submissions and videos and join us as we further the fight for women's rights. Through education and sharing experiences, we can make our policymakers and our President see that women\u2019s rights are, in fact, human rights.&nbsp;In Solidarity,&nbsp;**James Thompson Wichita, Kan.**@JamesThompsonKS", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "7739bw", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Hello all - here is the copy from an email the James Thompson for Kansas campaign sent out.", "num_comments": 0, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 4, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/7739bw/hello_all_here_is_the_copy_from_an_email_the/", "submission_time": "Wed Oct 18 05:21:32 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/7739bw/hello_all_here_is_the_copy_from_an_email_the/", "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [], "subreddit": "Feminism", "selftext": "", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "77au1w", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Whose freedom does society value?", "num_comments": 0, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 72350, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/77au1w/whose_freedom_does_society_value/", "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 04:10:54 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "https://i.redd.it/qdb2wugeiosz.png", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "I don\u2019t think people are necessarily wrong that this is a game being played by the Kremlin.

They should cast parts based on the ability to play the part, both in acting ability and in believability for the part (you can't cast someone in their 40s to play a teenager, for example).  Other legitimate factors are availability \u2013 the actor cannot have another time commitment for another project during the filming schedule.  These are all legitimate casting concerns.  What should NOT be a casting concern is willingness to engage in sex with the producer, the director, the casting specialist, etc.  For years, I've preferred independent and foreign films because they often offer better quality films than Hollywood ones.  However, the casting couch in Hollywood has long been another concern.  The casting couch also negatively affects the quality of films because then they may not cast based on who is actually best for the part.  This is why I'm frankly not at all surprised at the scandal involving Harvey Weinstein.  He's a symptom of the problem, not the cause.  Fundamental change in Hollywood is needed, not just the ousting of Weinstein.  Without fundamental change toward a system based on acting merit, the casting couch will continue, which will negatively affect the careers of actors and the quality of films.  Is there something you the film consumer can do about this?  Yes, there is.  You can support independent and foreign films.  There are high quality films out there that get overlooked.  I started watching French films to help me learn to speak French.  To my delight, I found that France creates some very high quality films.  I don't mind reading subtitles.  And with my French improving, sometimes I don't have to.  Of course, if it turns out that France also has a casting couch, I'll be very disappointed.  I hope not.

I didn't know that I was being sexually assaulted as a three year old. I was laying on a cold surface, staring at his white lab coat while he whispered in my ear.\"Does it tickle?\" When I was thirteen my cousin and I were walking my sister home from cheerleading practice. My mom liked us to always walk together, never alone. We passed by my middle school and a man drove next to us, turning his head and staring, his eyes hot and eager. As we walked further up the street, we saw the man standing next to a house directly in front of us. His pants were down and his hand was wrapped around his penis, frantically jerking as he stared at us walking towards him. My sister grabbed my hand and we ran to the closest house we knew. I remember asking her what it meant. I didn't understand.  \"This is why mom wants us to walk together\".When I was twenty I went to my sisters new apartment to get ready for a concert. Her new(now ex) husband had a few friends over that we're going to accompany us. When I arrived, they had all been drinking heavily. Later that evening I overheard the men joking about raping me in an alley, my sisters ex husband leading the conversation. That night he also grabbed my breast and looked me in the eyes while smiling.\"Oh, you're not Amanda.\"When I was twenty three, I went out to a club with my then partner for his sisters birthday. I spent the evening drinking and talking with them, with my partner by my side. We ended up leaving the club early due to having too much; waiting in the car and dozing until our DD came and drove us back to his sisters house. We went straight to his nieces bed and fell asleep. I woke up to my partners brother in law molesting me, while grabbing my hand and trying to get me to touch him. In my drunken haze I panicked and pretended to be passed out, silent and still. He would leave me alone, right? He didn't. He left and came back three times that night. He continued each time while whispering in my ear. \"Don't tell on me, okay?\" I couldn't find my voice then, but I did tell on him. \"Were you flirting with him? Did you entice him to do that?\" \"Why didn't she scream? Why didn't she wake you up? You were sleeping right next to her\" \"He told me he didn't do that. She's lying. He said he doesn't even think she's pretty anyways. She's not his type.\" I'm taking back my voice. #Metoo", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "7770yy", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "#Metoo.

When I was in 8th grade I had no friends, no one to sit with at lunch, not a single soul in the world to talk to besides my mother and father who were very judgmental and difficult to share things with. So I kept most things to myself. Well I ended up talking to one of the most popular guys in the whole school. I couldn't fucking believe he was talking to ME, I felt like a new person. The only thing I wasn't allowed to talk to him in public or at school and I couldn't tell anyone we were friends.So of course I complied I wanted SOMEONE to notice me and the most popular guy in school was interested in me. (Little did I understand he was preying on a weak target) so we started to talk online on AIM (throw back lol) and he said a lot of sexual stuff I had never even heard before and just went along with the conversation. I had barely even kissed a boy, he was my first boyfriend.So he started coming over my house and my mother was so happy I had someone to talk to especially IRL. So she encouraged us to go into the basement so it wasn't weird and awkward as she said. So we would hangout in the basement alone with just the TV on no lights or anything. He would start touching my breasts and vagina without taking off my clothes. I just kind of would push away and say no but he was bigger than I was and very angry. So I complied.Eventually after a few times of that he would push me on the floor (I weighed maybe 80lbs he weighed well over 150lbs) and lay on top of me. I couldn't do anything.This hurts so much but I want to talk about it. He would put all of his weight into my upper body so I could barely breathe as I begged him to let me go, he would cover my mouth if I got too loud or tried to yell out for help. He then would take his fingers and do a .... spreading motion? I don't know how to describe he it would take his fingers and try to fit all of them into my vagina and then open his fingers while inside my vaginaI bled so fucking much and was crying and yelping in agony as this was my first experience of anything sexual. I cannot explain how traumatizing it was. But he told me this is what people did and I should feel lucky someone was doing it to me. So I literally bit my lip as hard as I could with tears streaming down my face as he stuck his penis into me.It was so painful and not what I thought people did that were in love.Eventually I told someone in class that we were talking and it blew up in my face. He would get other people to mercilessly taunt me, push me on the floor and kick me, down throw my food tray down in lunch line,  some of these people were guys. I felt so deeply alone and ashamed. That's how he and I stopped talking and the rapes stopped. I'll never forget loosing my breathe with his weight on my body and his big meaty hand covering my mouth and I had hot tears running down my temples soaking my hair around my ears.My mother and I got into an argument about how I didn't tell her enough. So I blurted it out. I got raped in our basement by that quarter back she loved so much. **Her immediate response was: \"I'm still going to talk to him and we're not going to the cops\"**That response was so heavy I almost lost my breath as I did when he lay on my chest. She said I put myself in that position and didn't scream loud enough. She worked the snack stand at the school games and loved him. She was embarrassed that people would know her daughter got raped by the most popular guy in school. I feel like I'm living ina really sad fucking book sometimes. If anyone reads this and can relate in any way please DM me. I'm in a really dark hole and my mom didn't let me tell the cops (I was only 13) it feels so unreal. So this \"me too\" movement is making me remember that no one listened to me back then, and actually took his side. I hate myself.**TLDR; Got raped by one of the most popular guys in my school when I was 13, he spread my vagina open and traumatized me before raping me. My mom took his side and made me not go to the cops.  Now this \"me too\" movement is taking me back to that time and I feel so ashamed angry sick and confused with her and myself.**", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "777lhl", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "This \"Me Too\" movement is bringing up shitty memories from when I told my mom about my rape.

We were all sharing a hotel room, partying, drinking, etc.  I had a pretty strong buzz by the time I fell asleep.  I woke up to find one of my female friends with her hand down my pants and boxers, basically sexually assaulting me.  I was drunk and shocked.  I just pretended to be asleep because we were in a room full of friends and the whole thing could have blown up into a big embarrassing scene.  I really didn't know what to do.

I used to wonder if people made that up for attention. \u201cI\u2019m so pretty, people scream at me in the street!\u201d I was very naive in thinking the way I did, feeling like I just appear more confident so people know not to mess with me. I wasn\u2019t confident enough, I guess. I let my guard down once. (This got long, but sometimes I just need to talk things through to make it go away again.)Freshman year of college, I met this boy. I used to have trouble making friends, but he and I became close quickly. I didn\u2019t have a roommate because she had decided to just live at home last minute. He and his roommate had a futon, and I got way too comfortable way to fast, and started sleeping over. I learned the joys of having someone next to me at night. It was fun and comfortable to snuggle next to someone and be held. Sleeping over made my heart pound and I was always *ahem* excited in the morning, because it was such a thrill. Most of the other people I knew didn\u2019t really like this guy, but I was totally oblivious. Thinking back on it, I used to feel so strong for having made it through high school taking no shit from anyone, and knowing how to avoid the kinds of boys my sister and her friends were attracted to, who just wanted to use her locker for their stuff and who pushed her around because it was cute to then catch her before she fell. What I got when I discovered the freedoms of college and being so far from everything I was used to wasn\u2019t any better than those boys. He knew I was a virgin. I knew he had just ended his first relationship where he\u2019d lost his own virginity. \u201cWe decided\u201d to take it slow. We \u201cgot together\u201d one night when it was just the two of us, so it was sort of a matter of hear-say that we were indeed a \u201cthing\u201d. One night, I was just dozing off. I was sleeping on my side, and I moved my hand up to rest on my hip. A part of my sleepy brain was aware of how close his penis was to my hand, but I wouldn\u2019t have reached for it on my own, I just moved my hand. He slowly and carefully put my hand down his pants and used it to get himself off. This was my first interaction with a penis and I didn\u2019t even see it, not once. I was confused but also curious, uncomfortable but transfixed. I couldn\u2019t pretend to still be asleep but I couldn\u2019t take my hand back either. He finished, cleaned my arm off with the blanket, threw the blanket on the floor, kissed the side of my head, and then turned around and went to sleep. After a week of conflicted feelings and emotional turmoil, he apologized. I told him I was not comfortable with that and he agreed it shouldn\u2019t have happened, and it wouldn\u2019t happen again. We \u201cgot past it\u201d. Well, weeks later, we were kissing. Not a lot of petting or anything, mostly making out. His roommate was (hopefully) asleep. I still feel embarrassed if I think about it too much. His roommate was in the room when he climbed out of bed and put on a condom. All I could do was lay there, frozen in anxious anticipation. Once again, I never even saw the penis, which to me sort of signifies... something. I guess I just don\u2019t even know what went into my body. Anyway, he climbed up, and only my pants came off. He started slowly, but never stopped, not even as I was whimpering because it was painful for me and I was nervous and kind of wanted to stop but couldn\u2019t say so for some reason. He didn\u2019t kiss me during, he didn\u2019t do anything but stare into the pillow and pound away. When he was done he told me I could put my pants back on now, so I did. I went and got myself cleaned up and we just went to sleep. No talking, no checking in, nothing. The next day I was buzzing with a weird, frantic, anxious energy. Pretty soon after that he stopped wanting to hang out with me, and basically pretended our entire year of friendship/four-ish months of \u201ctogether\u201d never happened. He claimed I was making it up and I made myself look crazy trying to make him talk to me and explain what was going on. It was bewildering, and most of my friends know more than they probably wanted to know, because I needed someone or anyone to explain to me what had happened and why I lost my virginity the way that I did. To their credit, they are still very dear friends of mine to this day, and they don\u2019t ever speak of it. I physically couldn\u2019t eat much of anything for three months, because the sight of food turned my hunger into nausea. My now-boyfriend got me through the summer following freshman year by texting me nearly constantly and just allowing me to talk and build a new friendship, which eventually became our now-three year long relationship. I won\u2019t post on Facebook because my family (hardcore Catholic for the most part) most likely wouldn\u2019t understand, and my friends were subjected to it enough when it first happened. Also, deep down, I do feel like I should\u2019ve done more to stand my ground, to defend myself and my boundaries. I was so confident before him, but for no good reason at all, every bit of it flew out the window and my protective walls crashed down around me. I feel like I allowed things to go until there was no turning back, and I still get twinges of how deeply ashamed I was and how much I regretted it. I\u2019m not sure if this even counts for the MeToo thing, it all just comes back when I hear others talk about their experiences.

I think it was also a kneejerk reaction as I've heard \"but that happens to guys too\" as a way to make womens' issues seem like \"it's not really sexism if it happens to guys too\". In that light, while I get why someone would bring up the \"this happens to guys too\" perspective during a time like this and I agree that it does, I feel like it detracts from the issue we're actually talking about.But yeah, that was yesterday. Today, I mentioned it again because of the #metoo hashtag, and I mentioned that the trend of support for these women seemed really cool to me since I've been sexually assaulted before and it was just so comforting to see so many people care. I'd told him about this assault pretty early on into our relationship (we've been dating for two years and when we first started getting sexual, I told him because it was a part of the reason I was having trust issues in that department; he's a wonderful, loving partner and since then my issues have not been a problem, but that was my reason for disclosing it early on) and I think I'd just assumed he would've told me right then if it had happened to him too.Well today, as we talked, I asked him if he'd experienced any harassment before. To be honest, I didn't expect anything major as a response since he's never hinted at it (which I admit is completely my bad, you should never ask that question casually and my assumptions led me to do so) and he said that something very bad had happened in his past. We were talking over the phone so he said he'd go into detail when we see each other this week in person, but basically he'd been too ashamed to tell me before (which I get since I felt extreme shame when I first told him about my experience). I was really shocked and said that I'm so sorry, and I'm sorry I brought it up so casually. He said that's why he said the thing about \"it happens to guys too\".Is there anything I can do here? He said he's going to tell me the rest when we see each other but I feel kind of like an ass for assuming I was the only one with those experiences. Also would like to hear thoughts from commenters if it's wrong for me to respond to \"it happens to guys too\" in the way I did? Would really appreciate outside insight. I feel like sometimes with stuff that people peg as womens' issues, it's hard to ride the line of when \"it happens to guys too\" makes sense to say or if it's deflecting from the actual conversation, or maybe I was just being exclusionist,  I don't even know. Of course now my goal is just to be there for him when he tells me what happened (I'm not even sure if it was harassment or assault, he didn't go into details at all over the phone, said he's never told anyone before :( )Thanks for any thoughts/advice/insight.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "774gzp", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Advice?

This has his having way too much free time. And he spends it playing games constantly.

For right now, the tv is in our bedroom, because we move out of our place with  roommates places next month into our own place. So he stays up until about 4-6AM playing games even though I work in the morning. He says sorry, he tries to quiet he TV so it doesn't bother me, but it infuriates me. I've told him I feel like he doesn't care about me when he's constantly playing games, I ask him if he wants to go do things with me (take our dog to the park, go to the store, go to a movie, go to a theme park, etc) and he always says nah I'm not in the mood or \"I'm not trying to do all that today\" On my one off day of the week Sunday, I woke up and was excited to spend the day with him, he got a call from his friend saying his parents were out of town so they could play games together at his place so he immediately packed up and went over there and said he'd be back in time to hang out with me before it got dark and then didn't get back until it was dark and still played games when he came over.He doesn't understand that I feel so so so secondary to this stupid ass game.

The difference is I settled back into a healthy 8-hour sleep schedule a couple nights later and in the nearly 10 years I've been married to my husband I have never flaked on him for games, or let my screen light and video game sounds interfere with his sleep.How do you fix your relationship? Honestly, that depends on you, your boyfriend, and the steps both of you take towards health and a healthy relationship with a therapist. I think before that you need to consider that possibility that you're dealing with an addict. I feel that it takes a very special kind of person to make love work with people who suffer from addiction. If that's you, I applaud you, but I strongly encourage you to sit down and ask yourself if this is really acceptable to you.

In my preteens and early teens I became very withdrawn and insecure due to experiences with bullies, poor body image, and other personal issues. So I found solace in the internet and made friends online. I was always very innocent; I didn't kiss a boy until I was 15 (and I was honestly a bit disgusted by it), didn't have sex until I was 17/18 despite having the opportunity to do so sooner. I was far more concerned with getting to know and be comfortable with my own body than letting some short-sighted boy have his way with my body before I'd even figured it out for myself (which, though as an adult I have low self esteem, did *wonders* for my damaged self image as a teenager).The point of all that is to show how violating what happened to me at 14 was. Like I said, I made friends online. I met a guy in his 20s, who began manipulating me and harassing me after initially appearing harmless so I'd let my guard down. Then, he had photoshopped pictures of me. Which he threatened to send out to everyone I knew if I didn't do what he said. I don't remember everything he demanded, honestly I've blocked a most of it out and do *not* want to remember, but it ultimately culminated in him demanding real pictures. Since it felt like he controlled my life at that point, I finally complied after stalling and pleading with him as long as I could. I don't know if he realized how fucked up what he'd done was, if this was genuinely his intentions, or what, but he eventually spun some bullshit about doing that to \"teach me a lesson\" about trusting people on the internet. I begged him to delete the pictures, he said he did. And once I felt brave enough, I blocked him and tried to scrub him out of my memory. Thinking about him honestly makes me feel sick. I had a lot of issues with depression, anxiety, and PTSD afterwards. To the point that most of my memories from 14-almost 16 are really foggy, unclear, jumbled up, or just missing. I didn't begin to feel okay again until I was about 17. To top it off, I never told my family because I was embarrassed, scared of the repercussions, and scared of upsetting the guy. I eventually went to therapy for a few months, but I never told my therapist. It still helped. And I guess I eventually worked through everything on my own. Obviously, I became even more guarded after what happened, so I've never really been in a position where I could be taken advantage of again. I'm really good at reading people and situations now, I never lose my inhibitions, and I'm not afraid to tell a guy to fuck off. But I'm not sure what to consider what happened.

They are often aggressive and hostile and display a disregulated temper, and can lash out violently with provocation or frustration.Serious problems with interpersonal relationships are often seen in those with the disorder.

Individuals with this personality disorder will typically have no compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure, and frequently manipulate and deceive other people, achieving this through wit and a facade of superficial charm, or through intimidation and violence. They may display arrogance and think lowly and negatively of others, and lack remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude to those they have harmed. Irresponsibility is a core characteristic of this disorder: they can have significant difficulties in maintaining stable employment as well as fulfilling their social and financial obligations, and people with this disorder often lead exploitative, unlawful, or parasitic lifestyles.Those with antisocial personality disorder are often impulsive and reckless, failing to consider or disregarding the consequences of their actions. They may repeatedly disregard and jeopardize their own safety and the safety of others, and place themselves and others in danger. They are often aggressive and hostile and display a disregulated temper, and can lash out violently with provocation or frustration.Serious problems with interpersonal relationships are often seen in those with the disorder. Attachments and emotional bonds are weak, and interpersonal relationships often revolve around the manipulation, exploitation and abuse of others.

Instead, they give broad generalizations, not specifics, and even those generalizations change wildly over time.    2) Rarely to never is a solid and realistic solution proposed.

Not that they will be stopped if predictions are provided, but as predictions end up being reasonably correct it gives credence to the scientists providing these warnings. Otherwise, it makes it really easy for an opposing view to simply say \"nuh-uh\" and provide the same level of predictive evidence in making those two syllables.    My case and point is provided by a current example: Climate change. In the 1970s there were scientists predicting we were at risk of going into another ice age due to global cooling caused by humans because of their use of aerosols and the burning of fossil fuels. Then it changed decades later despite increased use of fossil fuels and now temperatures are warming, causing scientists to warn of global warming. But that's not entirely accurate because in recent years we are seeing many areas setting record low temperatures during the winter, making \"global warming\" a harder label to sell. Now that it has been changed to \"climate change\", it's really impossible for it to be obviously false through observable weather patterns, but also we are not provided any metric to confirm it outside of models spanning hundreds of years. Yeah, that's helpful... :/ In the meantime, it makes it really easy for critics to poke holes in the theory. As a byproduct, people are not taking ecological and environmental threats seriously because there are incentives to not do so. Like, you don't want to move into a 75 year old home, you want a new one. So cut down those trees, force those animals into the expressway, and kick your feet up on your new couch in your new home! Oh, and make sure you apply the right fertilizer that is causing algae blooms and the pesticides that are leaching into the water supply and causing bigger ecological damage than just not having mosquitoes in the evening.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 26975, "stickied": false, "score": 14, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 18 23:17:39 2017", "ups": 14}, {"body": "My shed disagrees.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 96428, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 18 23:17:52 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "Now if only the number of mosquitos around here in the summer would \"plunge dramatically\".

The False Narrative of Anti-Rohingya Violence  The history of the Rohingya is not as one-sided as the current media portrayals suggest. The Rohingya are descendants of the Afghan Pathan and Indian Bengali Muslims from the Mughal period. The history of persecution isn\u2019t one-sided either. The animosity goes back to the time of the last Mughals, when Shah Shuja fled to Arakan with his defeated army, then tried to take over the Arakan (Rakhine) kingdom, which was then primarily Buddhist and Hindu, in the seventeenth century.  In the nineteenth century, the British resettled hundreds of thousands of Muslims to Burma for cheap labor, destroying the delicate demographic balance in the Rakhine region. In the 1940s, there were massive anti-Buddhist violence committed by Rohingya calling themselves Mujahideens. Around 50,000 Buddhists were butchered in cyclical violence, around the same time ethnic cleansing was taking place in the great Calcutta killing. All that has resulted in a historic distrust between communities which lasts to this day, not just in Myanmar, but also in the far eastern parts of India.  Ask anyone in eastern Indian states or in Thailand or Burma, and you will get a very different picture of the problem. In modern times, the Rohingya jihad started in around the 1970s and was successfully quashed by the Burmese military, in one of the rare incidents of a successful COIN operation, which resulted in a decade and half of relative peace. This latest crisis is also a brutal reaction to the Rohingya jihadists launching attacks on Burmese policemen, a fact increasingly lost in the repeated argumenta ad passiones in Western media. The Buddhists in Myanmar have seen what fate befell Kashmiri pandits in India and Coptic Christians in Egypt.  For liberals, though, it is all about optics. With the jihadist violence snowballing into an insurgency in Europe alongside the hopelessness and inevitable failure of the Arab Spring and the growing anti-Islamist sentiment across Europe, liberals in the media and academia were on the lookout for another good global battle. Nothing rejuvenates the interventionists and institutionalists as another utopian noble cause, and the Rohingya provide another ultimate opportunity to signal virtues and bolster internationalist credentials that are under question following the recent setbacks.  That is also the same reason why San Suu Kyi, a veritable hero of democracy, suddenly is a figure of villainy. As Peter Hitchens pointed out in 2003, Milosevic was a hero to the Left before he turned nationalist. Suu Kyi, who finally managed to change Myanmar from a junta, led hell to a chaotic and nascent democracy. She understands what our liberal idealist internationalist elites refuse to accept, and is channeling the nationalist majority opinion of her countrymen.  It is about time the debate about Rohingya in the West is more balanced as well. There are no viable options for the West in Myanmar, and sometimes realpolitik and buck-passing is the hardest and right thing to do.

There's an argument to be made for a right to privacy, an argument to be made for public safety, an argument to be made for free practice of religion, and so on and so forth.For some reason I'm reminded of the Rosa Parks story, which was heavily publicised during the American Civil Rights movement. She merely sat down on a bus during segregation which banned black Americans from sitting in that area of the bus. Nothing uncivil, but she refused to get up, and was arrested for that conduct. The incident served as a strong point for the Civil Rights movement.I fast forward to today, imagining a similar incident. Some old Muslim woman gets on a bus wearing a full head covering, is asked to remove it, she declines, and of course is promptly arrested and charged. Then for months on end this story is publicised and overtly exploited by Islamic apologists who claim the west hates them. Deep down, we all know that old Muslim lady wasn't going to start any shit, but we also know that people wearing face coverings usually do so to conceal their identity, and the most obvious reason to do so would be if you have or are about to commit a crime. Thus we write off the injustice as a casualty of maintaining public safety, dismiss the notion that we're intolerant bigots, and move on with our day.Doesn't sit right with me, but I don't know of any better alternatives either.
