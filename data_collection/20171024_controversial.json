That isn't a suppression of free speech in the traditional and lawful extent, but I also don't think it makes us a better society in any way. It makes us less free and less open to new ideas. I also hate it equally from the right. Whether in entertainment, public speeches, or otherwise people should have the right to say what they want, and they do to an extent. But not a year goes by when someone doesn't look to demonize some form of public discourse or entertainment simply because they don't agree with it on a personal level and that annoys the shit out of me.  If a small group of people want to listen to a crazy person on a college campus they should have the right to do so. Anyone who doesn't agree with it, doesn't have to show up and listen.

He is basically *the* Fourth Amendment tech law scholar, and he always provides incisive arguments that make you think. I'm sure TechDirt will be more than willing to flip their opinion when they see where he comes down on things like [Section 702](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/10/20/the-fourth-amendment-and-querying-the-702-database-for-evidence-of-crimes/). Anyway, let's get to the substance of [his brief](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3047300)!> The least weird argument is Kerr's assertion cell site location records shouldn't be covered by the Fourth Amendment because they are the equivalent of \"observation in a public space.\" This is undoubtedly trueYou've already accepted more than you know.> but it does allow the government to perform these \"observations\" without actually having to use its own eyeballs. Instead of tracking someone's movement through direct, in-person surveillance, the government can serve a subpoena to phone companies and use constantly-collected data to perform retrospective tracking.So? I'm serious, and we're about to see why. (EDIT: You might be putting a lot of weight on 'retrospective'. But consider the case of a ticket-taker at a train station. You use the train station in the course of your public movements. The ticket-taker sees you (and has a record of the encounter). He can be subpoenaed to testify about what he saw in public, even though it's \"retrospective\" from the standpoint of the police.) They quote Kerr's example:> [I]magine a world without communications networks. If Alice wants to communicate with Bob, Alice has to leave her home and travel to Bob\u2019s house. If the police suspect that Alice and Bob are conspirators planning a crime, and they assign an officer to watch Alice\u2019s whereabouts, the police can collect only some information without triggering the Fourth Amendment. The police cannot learn the contents of what Alice and Bob said inside Bob\u2019s home without a warrant. On the other hand, the police can observe Alice and see what she did in public \u2013 when she left home, where she traveled, when she arrived at Bob\u2019s house, and where they both live \u2013 without triggering the Fourth Amendment.> Next imagine that Alice calls Bob on her cell phone instead of meeting him in person. Alice no longer has to travel to meet Bob. The cell phone network delivers the call from Alice to Bob, making a remote transfer that eliminates the need for a public trip. But, critically, the same information exists. What was previously the contents of the conversation in Bob\u2019s house is now the contents of the phone call between Alice and Bob. And what was previously Alice\u2019s publicly observable trip from her house to Bob\u2019s house is now a record that the phone provider generated and may keep about when the call was made, to and from what numbers, and what cell towers were used to deliver it.He's getting at the inside/outside distinction from the physical world, the reason why content is different from non-content routing information.> What's glossed over in this analogy is the existence of landlines. This middle step is instructive and its absence from Kerr's brief seems almost disingenuous. For years, criminal collaborators used landlines and payphones to converse. This is what the Third Party Doctrine is predicated on: phone records.You didn't seem to have read Kerr very well. He has an entire section with the phrase, \"The Third Party Doctrine is About Manifesting Subjective Expectations of Privacy.\" He thinks you've just got the whole point of the Third Party Doctrine wrong. It's not \"about phone records\". You'd also have seen this if you continued reading to the end of the section you quoted. From Kerr:> This approach should lead the Court to reaffirm the traditional rule, over a century old, that collection of non-content addressing information for a network communication does not implicate the customer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. See Ex Parte Jackson, 96 U.S. 727, 733 (1878) (postal letters); Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (1979) (telephone calls).The postal letters citation should be illustrative that it's *not* \"about phone records\". (EDIT: Postal letters and phone records are both retrospective from the standpoint of the police, in case you were worried about that above.) And then your argument takes a leap in the direction of weird:> These captured numbers dialed and length of conversations. The only location of interest was already known: the residence/phone booth containing the targeted phone. If law enforcement wanted information on suspects' movements, they still needed to deploy some form of additional surveillance.You're setting up location information as being fundamentally different from phone records in some unspecified way, but it's clear that you've missed the point of Kerr's hypothetical. Before phone/mail, if police wanted to, they could monitor who you talk to by observing your public movements. With phone/mail, the stand-in for your public movements is the routing information that you give to others (either with a phone number you give to the company or an address you write on the exterior of an envelope). His whole point is that *this* is the right analogy, and your distinction of \"types of surveillance\" isn't grounded in either Fourth Amendment law or fundamental principles.> Kerr is arguing law enforcement should have access to people's public movements without having to do the actual legwork.This is false. He's arguing that for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, that information is analogous. Whether or not police actually chose to monitor your public movements or actually chose to get your postal records or actually chose to get your phone records (EDIT: or actually chose to interview the ticket-taker at the train station), the point is that they *could*.

He is basically *the* Fourth Amendment tech law scholar, and he always provides incisive arguments that make you think. I'm sure TechDirt will be more than willing to flip their opinion when they see where he comes down on things like [Section 702](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/10/20/the-fourth-amendment-and-querying-the-702-database-for-evidence-of-crimes/). Anyway, let's get to the substance of [his brief](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3047300)!> The least weird argument is Kerr's assertion cell site location records shouldn't be covered by the Fourth Amendment because they are the equivalent of \"observation in a public space.\" This is undoubtedly trueYou've already accepted more than you know.> but it does allow the government to perform these \"observations\" without actually having to use its own eyeballs. Instead of tracking someone's movement through direct, in-person surveillance, the government can serve a subpoena to phone companies and use constantly-collected data to perform retrospective tracking.So? I'm serious, and we're about to see why. (EDIT: You might be putting a lot of weight on 'retrospective'. But consider the case of a ticket-taker at a train station. You use the train station in the course of your public movements. The ticket-taker sees you (and has a record of the encounter). He can be subpoenaed to testify about what he saw in public, even though it's \"retrospective\" from the standpoint of the police.) They quote Kerr's example:> [I]magine a world without communications networks. If Alice wants to communicate with Bob, Alice has to leave her home and travel to Bob\u2019s house. If the police suspect that Alice and Bob are conspirators planning a crime, and they assign an officer to watch Alice\u2019s whereabouts, the police can collect only some information without triggering the Fourth Amendment. The police cannot learn the contents of what Alice and Bob said inside Bob\u2019s home without a warrant. On the other hand, the police can observe Alice and see what she did in public \u2013 when she left home, where she traveled, when she arrived at Bob\u2019s house, and where they both live \u2013 without triggering the Fourth Amendment.> Next imagine that Alice calls Bob on her cell phone instead of meeting him in person. Alice no longer has to travel to meet Bob. The cell phone network delivers the call from Alice to Bob, making a remote transfer that eliminates the need for a public trip. But, critically, the same information exists. What was previously the contents of the conversation in Bob\u2019s house is now the contents of the phone call between Alice and Bob. And what was previously Alice\u2019s publicly observable trip from her house to Bob\u2019s house is now a record that the phone provider generated and may keep about when the call was made, to and from what numbers, and what cell towers were used to deliver it.He's getting at the inside/outside distinction from the physical world, the reason why content is different from non-content routing information.> What's glossed over in this analogy is the existence of landlines. This middle step is instructive and its absence from Kerr's brief seems almost disingenuous. For years, criminal collaborators used landlines and payphones to converse. This is what the Third Party Doctrine is predicated on: phone records.You didn't seem to have read Kerr very well. He has an entire section with the phrase, \"The Third Party Doctrine is About Manifesting Subjective Expectations of Privacy.\" He thinks you've just got the whole point of the Third Party Doctrine wrong. It's not \"about phone records\". You'd also have seen this if you continued reading to the end of the section you quoted. From Kerr:> This approach should lead the Court to reaffirm the traditional rule, over a century old, that collection of non-content addressing information for a network communication does not implicate the customer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. See Ex Parte Jackson, 96 U.S. 727, 733 (1878) (postal letters); Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (1979) (telephone calls).The postal letters citation should be illustrative that it's *not* \"about phone records\". (EDIT: Postal letters and phone records are both retrospective from the standpoint of the police, in case you were worried about that above.) And then your argument takes a leap in the direction of weird:> These captured numbers dialed and length of conversations. The only location of interest was already known: the residence/phone booth containing the targeted phone. If law enforcement wanted information on suspects' movements, they still needed to deploy some form of additional surveillance.You're setting up location information as being fundamentally different from phone records in some unspecified way, but it's clear that you've missed the point of Kerr's hypothetical. Before phone/mail, if police wanted to, they could monitor who you talk to by observing your public movements. With phone/mail, the stand-in for your public movements is the routing information that you give to others (either with a phone number you give to the company or an address you write on the exterior of an envelope). His whole point is that *this* is the right analogy, and your distinction of \"types of surveillance\" isn't grounded in either Fourth Amendment law or fundamental principles.> Kerr is arguing law enforcement should have access to people's public movements without having to do the actual legwork.This is false. He's arguing that for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, that information is analogous. Whether or not police actually chose to monitor your public movements or actually chose to get your postal records or actually chose to get your phone records (EDIT: or actually chose to interview the ticket-taker at the train station), the point is that they *could*. The Fourth Amendment *permitted it*. The amount of legwork required is nowhere to be found in the Fourth Amendment. There is no, \"...plus, even if it's not a search, if it seems 'too easy', we're going to require a warrant,\" in there.> And he starts this argument by ignoring the fact law enforcement has -- for years! -- been unable to do anything more than collect phone records sans location data.Again, a misreading.

But that's not the meaningful part - it's the analogy between the process of communication and public movement.> But now phone records also contain information about people's movements, and Kerr believes they should be inseparable and easily-accessible.Again, he's not taking a stance on whether it \"should be easily-accessible\".
