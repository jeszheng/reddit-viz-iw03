This class is further broken down into subclasses.  I won't get into semantics, but the main ones include [automatic firearms] [concealable firearms] [.32 calibre firearms]To get a non-restricted firearm you must take a written and practical test by an authorised instructor. Once you pass the test, you send your test papers along with your license papers to the RCMP and pay a fee and then you receive Your Possession and Acquisition License, or PAL. After that, you have full freedom to purchase and transport any non-restricted firearm or ammunition for it, as long as you abide the rules set out in the course.To receive a restricted PAL, you must first take the the non-restricted course, as well as the restricted course (you can take/apply simultaneously). You must also not have been convicted of any crimes which would deem you dangerous with a firearm (theft, assault, murder, rape, etc.) If you have any mental illness, you must receive a note from your doctor saying you are fit to own a firearm. You must also have two references who have known you for at least two years that will vouch for you. Once you have your PAL, if you wish to purchase a restricted firearm you must register it with the RCMP. Included in your PAL is as permit to transport from the place of purchase to your home and to and from a gunsmith or, if the you have the correct type, your gun club.Your right to use the firearm is dependent on the type of PAL you applied for - Target or Collector. Collector PALs are only allowed to own the firearm, not use it. In order to have a target PAL, you must prove you are with a Gun Club. This means purchasing a membership. You are only allowed to use said firearm at that Gun Club.Prohibited Firearms get very complicated, so I'll be leaving a lot out on it. For the case of your average Canadian, you can only receive a Prohibited PAL your parent already owns a prohibited firearm and is passing it down to you, or if you work in a job that requires a prohibited firearm. The process is ten times harder than the other two. You also restricted to only owning the subclass(s) of firearm you are licensed for. There are different restrictions for purchase, transport and use depending on the subclass of firearm. Basically, unless you are very lucky you will never own a prohibited firearm.Other restrictions that don't fall into the prior:*  detachable/internal box magazines are restricted to a five round capacity, except for .22 calibre and some other exceptions (10 for small arms)* Explosive, incendiary, or other types of admonitions with the purpose to maim are outright illegal.* The AK-47 is a class 12-2 prohib, regardless of it being automatic or semi-auto (most semi-auto \"assault rifles\" are restricted).*Silencers are outright illegal*Not all firearms are classified by the definitions I gave them. Ultimately, the gov't decides what class to give them.My biggest complaints with our laws is the 5 round capacity, the classification of .32 calibre as prohibited, and the fact that there are certain firearms that are prohibited, but really have need to.Fun Fact: You can technically own some cool firearms, like grenade launchers or light machine guns. You cannot have explosive rounds, though. This means the grenade launcher is simply a very large rifle.

Criminals will still get their hands on weapons - and yes they'll be less effective and it reduces crime, it also means their victims are often defenceless, less overall victims, but higher risk to victims. If the weapon used in the recent mass shooting was acquired illegally - nothing would be changed with banning guns outright. Regardless of that, I think it would be preferable to move towards a populace without guns in small steps.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 79130, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 20:24:56 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Get your shit together!", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 14849, "stickied": false, "score": -2, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 20:27:32 2017", "ups": -2}, {"body": "They have a serious issue with divisiveness and completely demonizing anyone who disagrees with one of their beliefs.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 9111, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 20:11:04 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "Nice try Donald", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 181, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 19:56:51 2017", "ups": 5}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/741asl/for_those_who_do_not_live_in_the_usa_and_arent_us/", "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "My ex asked me to stop eating in bed.

In a way, this extends to society writ large. A major trope in non-US countries hit on a theme of general helplessness - Old Boy in Korea being a good example, as well as Liar Game in Japan, Clockwork Orange in the UK, et cetera. Part of the US cultural focus on individualism centers around the supremacy of the individual over the powers of state coercion as well as the powers of groupthink, and places the idea of Justice in the hands of the individual - the message that 'you are never helpless, you can always help yourself'. A firearm is thus a tool borne by the individual to demand Justice and to exact it on their own terms, if all other recourse fails. I am not describing this in a strictly positive way, but I am describing how highly individual societies would see guns as a positive in their social system.tl;dr its the reason why many Law and Order episodes where the culprit gets off on a technicality, end with the culprit getting killed on the courtroom steps by an aggrieved party.

During most of its life, a star is a balance of two major forces - gravity, which acts to pull the stars gas down into a single point, and photon pressure, caused by gamma rays produced in the fusion process, that forces that gas away. Gravity causes the gas to contract on itself, increasing core pressure and thermodynamic temperature and thus the rate of fusion. This increased rate of fusion produces more gamma rays that push back on the gas from within, balancing it out.In those massive, low metalicity stars, the gravity is so strong that temperature is high enough that gamma rays with enormous energies are produced in the fusion process.

During most of its life, a star is a balance of two major forces - gravity, which acts to pull the stars gas down into a single point, and photon pressure, caused by gamma rays produced in the fusion process, that forces that gas away. Gravity causes the gas to contract on itself, increasing core pressure and thermodynamic temperature and thus the rate of fusion. This increased rate of fusion produces more gamma rays that push back on the gas from within, balancing it out.In those massive, low metalicity stars, the gravity is so strong that temperature is high enough that gamma rays with enormous energies are produced in the fusion process. These gamma rays can spontaneously interact with a nearby nucleus of hydrogen or helium, converting into a positron and electron pair. But here's the catch - positrons and electrons do not produce that photon pressure that is vital to the stars balance, and the star contracts further, despite it growing hotter.This contraction increases the temperature, which increases the likely hood of positron-electron pair formation, which causes a runaway thermonuclear reaction in the stars core that can burn the entire core's mass of hydrogen in a few *seconds*.This results in an explosion so powerful, it completely destroys the star, leaving nothing but a glowing nebular remnant.

I tell them I write about movies and popular culture, analyzing the message in the medium. Most people find this exciting and want to know more. everyone goes to movies, watches television, glances through magazines, and everyone has thoughts about the messages they receive, about the images they look at. It is easy for the diverse public I encounter to understand what I do as a cultural critic, to understand my passion for writing (lots of want to write, and do). But feminist theory - that\u2019s the place where the questions stop. Instead I tend to hear all about the evil of feminism and the bad feminists: how \u201cthey\u201d hate men; how \u201cthey\u201d want to go against nature and god; how \u201cthey\u201d are all lesbians; how \u201cthey\u201d are taking all the jobs and making the world hard for white men, who do not stand a chance.When I ask these same folks about the feminist books or magazines they read, when I ask them about the feminist talks they have heard, about the feminist activists they know, they respond by letting me know that everything they know about feminism has come into their lives third-hand, that they really have not come close enough to feminist movement to know what really happens, what it\u2019s really about. Mostly they think feminism is a bunch of angry women who want to be like men. They do not even think about feminism as being about rights - about women gaining equal rights. When I talk about the feminism I know - up close and personal - they willingly listen, although when our conversations end, they are quick to tell me I am different, not like the \u201creal\u201d feminists who hate men, who are angry. I assure them I am as a real and as radical a feminist as one can be, and if they dare to come closer to feminism they will see it is not how they have imagined it.Each time I leave one of these encounters, I want to have in my hand a little book so that I can say, read this book, and it will tell you what feminism is, what the movement is about. I want to be holding in my hand a concise, fairly easy to read and understand book; not a long book, not a book thick with hard to understand jargon and academic language, but a straightforward, clear book - easy to read without being simplistic. From the moment feminist thinking, politics, and practice changed my life, I have wanted this book. I have wanted to give it to the folk I love so that they can understand better this cause, this feminist politics I believe in so deeply, that is the foundation of my political life.I have wanted them to have an answer to the question \u201cwhat is feminism?\u201d that is rooted neither in fear or fantasy. I have wanted them to have this simple definition to read again and again so they know: \u201cFeminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.\u201d I love this definition, which I first offered more than 10 years ago in my book Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center. Ilove it because it so clearly states that the movement is not about being anti-male. It makes it clear that the problem is sexism. And that clarity helps us remember that all of us, female and male, have been socialized from birth on to accept sexist thought and action. As a consequence, females can be just as sexist as men. And while that does not excuse or justify male domination, it does mean that it would be naive and wrong-minded for feminist thinkers to see the movement as simplistically being for women against men. To end patriarchy (another way of naming the institutionalized sexism) we need to be clear that we are all participants in perpetuating sexism until we change our minds and hearts, until we let go of sexist thought and action and replace it with feminist thought and action.Males as a group have and do benefit the most from patriarchy, from the assumption that they are superior to females and should rule over us. But those benefits have come with a price. In return for all the goodies men receive from patriarchy, they are required to dominate women, to exploit and oppress us, using violence if they must to keep patriarchy intact. Most men find it difficult to be patriarchs. Most men are disturbed by hatred and fear of women, by male violence against women, even the men who perpetuate this violence. But they fear letting go of the benefits. They are not certain what will happen to the world they know most intimately if patriarchy changes. So they find it easier to passively support male domination even when they know in their minds and hearts that it is wrong. Again and again men tell me they have no idea what it is feminists want. I believe them. I believe in their capacity to change and grow. And I believe that if they knew more about feminism they would no longer fear it, for they would find in feminist movement the hope of their own release from the bondage of patriarchy.It is for these men, young and old, and for all of us, that I have written this short handbook, the book Ihave spent more than 20 years longing for. I had to write it because I kept waiting for it to appear, and it did not. And without it there was no way to address the hordes of people in this nation who are daily bombarded with anti-feminist backlash, who are being told to hate and resist a movement that they know very little about. There should be so many little feminist primers, easy to read pamphlets and books, telling us all about feminism, that this book would be just another passionate voice speaking out on behalf of feminist politics. There should be billboards; ads in magazines; ads on buses, subways, trains; television commercials spreading the word, letting the world know more about feminism. We are not there yet. But this is what we must do to share feminism, to let the movement into everyone\u2019s mind and heart. Feminist change has already touched all our lives in a positive way. And yet we lose sight of the positive when all we hear about feminism is negative.When I began to resist male domination, to rebel against patriarchal thinking (and to oppose the strongest patriarchal voice in my life - my mother\u2019s voice), I was still a teenager, suicidal, depressed, uncertain about how I would find meaning in my life and a place for myself. I needed feminism to give me a foundation of equality and justice to stand on. Mama has come around to feminist thinking. She sees me and all her daughters (we are six) living better lives because of feminist politics. She sees the promise and hope in feminist movement. It is that promise and hope that I want to share with you in this book, with everybody.Imagine living in a world where there is no domination, where females and males are not alike or even always equal, but where a vision of mutuality is the ethos shaping our interaction. Imagine living in a world where we can all be who we are, a world of peace and possibility. Feminist revolution alone will not create such a world; we need to end racism, class elitism, imperialism. But it will make it possible for us to be fully self-actualized females and males able to create beloved community, to live together, realizing our dreams of freedom and justice, living the truth that we are all \u201ccreated equal.\u201d Come closer.

In my eyes as long as the private parts are properly covered, you're fine. Show as much leg and such as you want. My own girlfriend shows a lot of skin, as she has a rather low heat tolerance, and just thinks she looks better dressing in a style that shows more skin. She doesn't show cleavage, as she feels it'd grab too much attention, but she still wears mid-thigh shorts, shows her arms, wears sandals, shows a bit of her collarbones and back, may show a bit of her midriff, etc. Luckily, she doesn't seem to be judged much. Only like one person tried preaching to her about how she should me more \"modest\" and shit. But in general...women are judged a lot for dressing in a manner similar to my girlfriend's.

But outside of an entire system change, I think there's a simple and equitable way to approach it in our current world:  Each partner should think about it and decide whether they more highly value keeping the last name they have or sharing a name with their partner. Anyone can choose to value \"Keep\" or \"Share\", but only one. Both is entitled and demanding.  If you both prefer to keep your names, do so! No trouble, everything easy.   If one of you values Share over Keep, that person changes their name to that of their partner and they now share a name.   If you both value Share over Keep, then you can discuss and decide which name to pick, or whether to choose something new, since you know you're both up for the options. (Personally, I favour choosing the more awesome name - why on earth does Johnny Wiener choose to subject his children to the elementary school he went through??)It's simple and should be no trouble unless one of the partners is an entitled, demanding jerk.It even solves it for children in 3/4 cases, and the fourth one you'll just still need to talk about that part of the equation as well if it's going to be a consideration for you.-----Personally, we both kept our own names because we saw insufficient reason to do anything else.

I have a confession. A little background, I'm a female in my early 20s. I recently moved to Brooklyn after doing a little bit of college back in my hometown. My relationship with my family isn't good, my mom died and my dad was abusing me. I didn't have many friends so I decided to pack a few bags and try to start over in the city while never looking back. I couldn't continue my education after moving to NYC because it was too expensive but I tried to save some money waitressing at an expensive restaurant in TriBeCa for school. To get enough money for my rent and to save for school, my waitressing job wasn't enough. I got into webcamming or being a cam girl from a recommendation from a Reddit user. I tried a sugar baby meeting with a sugar daddy once with the help of a website but didn't like it. I didn't like the whole concept of meeting and hanging out with actual person for money. They could've been dangerous or could've harmed me. The online webcam thing seemed a lot better and safer in my eyes. I've now been camming for about half a year and I'm pretty good at it too if I say so myself. I've made enough money that I'll be able to attend school next semester and continue my education.  One day at work I was serving a man that was dining alone. I did my usual routine and talked about our specials. After I got his order written, he told me I looked familiar and that he knew me from somewhere. I didn't recognize him, I don't know that many people except my coworkers, my parents and few friends back home. I was never a popular girl until I became a bit popular online for my \"girl next door\" image cam shows. A moment later, my worst nightmare happened. \"Oh- I remember now, that internet thing you do, with the live shows.\" I guess I made a really disgusted and scared faced cause he said \"Don't worry I won't tell anyone.\" I continued with the rest of my shift uncomfortable and scared and paranoid. I didn't know that many people so I never thought that someone would've recognized me from the webcam shows. I didn't tell anyone about the creepy guy cause how I could I admit that I worked as a cam girl to my coworkers. After finishing work, I was last cut and was leaving around 2am. As I got off the subway and was walking back to my apartment. I felt kind of scared but it was normal, being a woman walking late at night, and it's kind of in the sketchier part of Brooklyn. After going back to school i had been trying to save money to move to a safer part of New York but it's more expensive.As I unlocked my door, the man from earlier came around the corner and pushed me into my apartment building. He pushed me onto the floor and started stripping his clothes. You can guess what happened next.While it was happening he told me he has been giving me stars since I started the camshows and invested so much money into me so why didn't I ever reply to his messages. I was popular as a cam model cause after my naked scenes I would talk about my viewers about my life and how I was saving up for school. I developed fans really fast due to that's meaningful topics. He said it didn't take much for him to find me. All it took was him reverse google searching one of the images on my pages which lead to my Instagram and Facebook. He found where I worked and followed me home. He told me as he raped me that I shouldn't be saying no because while I was showing my naked body on the cam shows I was secretly telling/signaling him that I wanted his hands to touch me and be inside me. After he finished he told me if I contact the police and report the rape he will reveal to my parents and boss about my cam show past. I'm kind of in shock and depressed and sad and feel so alone right now. I don't know who to talk to about this and just wanted to share or Reddit.

I've also read comments from other Redditors on this topic, which were illuminating.This might not appeal to you at all right now, but just throwing this out there: I was close with someone who was abused by her father and she found relief in taking care of animals in her spare time, to get outside herself. Personally I've also found small acts of kindness to be a breath of fresh air, listening to my friends' problems, giving them advice and support, giving money to someone on the street or to charity (RAINN being one of them), etc. Or sometimes I just binge-watch a show when I feel suffocated by a problem.Maybe this idea is too basic to even be worth suggesting but if you have time, you might consider taking up a hobby where you can make more friends in the city both for support on a regular basis and also to feel safer. Whether that's yoga or a cooking class or going to some kind of one-off event.

The reason that old folks in Japan become 100-110 years old is because they have a functioning care system for the elderly. Here, I have had friends tell me stories of them visiting their grandparents at the care centers, and the grandparents having heart attacks, without the nurses doing anything - in fact, they pretty much ignored them. I have more stories of things that have happened in Norwegian hospitals, if you're interested.

So by bringing up Australia and, implicitly, mass confiscation, you poison the discussion and prevent any kind of moderate accommodation.", "gilded": 3, "author_comment_karma": 6627, "stickied": false, "score": 7611, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 18:25:51 2017", "ups": 7611}, {"body": "Background: First, i do not own a gun, shoot guns, or desire to own a gun. I live in a state where I am certainly not the norm. This post isn't to state my political or social beliefs on the matter. I am a 33yo white male from a completely (and I mean completely) red state.I think part of the problem is America's 'recent' need for them relative to the timeline of history. Most established countries in this world are more than 240 years old. In that 240 years we used guns to liberate ourselves from an oppressive government that was taxing without representation, we used them to expand into the wild frontier, to win a war against ourselves to attempt ending slavery, won two world wars (and multiple others), and fed ourselves. It's not been but for the last 40-50 years America has lost the 'need' for guns.... but have we really? To some, i think the answer is no. We live in a time where we are so divided as a country that we feel the need to forcefully defend ourselves is fast approaching. You can feel the tensions mounting as our presidents fail, one after another, to unify us. We aren't sure what we are going to need them for but there is an undertone that we aren't quite done with guns. The South thinks they will rise again and the government will have to let them out of their cold dead fingers. How can they overthrow the US government without guns? Those opposing know they might need guns to defend themselves. Poverty areas are littered with guns for a different reason... because they are filled with crime and police (in many situations they are simply just out manned) , society, and government do little, if anything,  to help out. Our police dont help the matter any as they are an extension of our government and routinely abuse their power and frequently use a gun to do it. Most police, however, responsibly use them to truely defend but they are only necessary because evryone they encounter has them. So where do we start? Compton? Do we leave them defenseless? Texas? HA, GOOD luck, you're goimg to have to take the nation gaurd with you. Our police? Are we going to send brave men and women into Compton without a way to protect themselves. It's all just so fresh in our minds. We all know we would be better off without them in our society but it's all just excuses because its in our countries DNA that we might need them again very soon. To me, this sums up why i believe we keep them aroumd... Better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them.In the meantime, mentally ill, politically motivated, irresponsible, irrational people pick up the nearest gun and go to work on their neighbor. It's just hard to know where to go next, we are lost on the matter as a country and we havent had and don't have the leadership in the white house, senate, or anywhere in the capitol to fix it.    Edit: thank you to so many for the support on my analysis. Please remember this is just MY analysis on why we are having a hard time as a country with gun control. REMINDER TO SOME: I AM NOT TRYING TO DRAFT LEGISLATION TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. Just having a conversation. The U.S. constitution and Bill of Rights is part of what sets us apart in a good way.

His conclusion was that it was simply not feasible.  There is no outcome where citizens who legally obtained their firearms will willingly give up their weapons the way they did in Aus.  The difference between the countries is that the United States has a relatively short history compared to many other nations and the memories of the Revolutionary war, as well as the culture those memories created, leave us with a unique perspective on the ownership of weapons.  Australia had no such revolution.  The United States would not be a nation, without the ownership of firearms by the colonists.  Our guns are very different now, to be sure....but I'm not the one you need to convince.A portion of them would also likley see such policy as a flagrant violation of the Second Amendment and defend their right to keep those weapons with violence.  I don't think these incidents would be isolated, either.  It's important to keep in mind that the number of people who legally own firearms in the United States DWARFS the number of people the United States government has in the armed forces or law enforcement....nevermind the fact that many of those individuals come from families who are staunch supporters of the 2nd Amendment themselves.
