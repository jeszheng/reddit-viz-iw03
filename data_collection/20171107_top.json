Almost nobody is willing to have reasonable, give and take dialogue with one another. One must always be right and never admit you are wrong. The current clown in the WH certainly doesn\u2019t help. Smaller units are likely more capable of achieving concessi. Americans seem to always let the gun control issue devolve down to whether guns should be banned or not and, for the most part drag the 2nd amendment into the argument when it\u2019s not relevant ( the gun lobby always trots this out and the mob dutifully starts their indignation act about the sanctity of a constitution written over two centuries ago ).It\u2019s about gun control not banning guns. For example the latest madman in Texas left behind 15 empty 30 shot clips behind. That\u2019s 450 rounds of high powered rifle cartridges folks put through a semi-automatic rifle with just a few seconds for someone practiced to eject the empty clip and ram a new one in. I hunted deer for 20 years and never fired more than two shots at the same deer. There is an old native saying; \u201c One shot, dead deer. Two shots, maybe. Three shots, no way. \u201c.The kind of rapid firepower this latest guy had serves only one purpose: to kill a lot of people. It\u2019s a war weapon.You want home defence, buy a 12 gauge. Works much better inside. African big cat hunters use a 12 gauge to go into the long grass after a wounded lion, tiger whatever. I think they have a reason for that. Just think about this. I am Canadian and I know our gun laws pretty well, having practised law for 35 years +. In this country it\u2019s not hard to buy a long gun for most people if you take a federal firearms safety course and pass an exam to qualify  to get your gun licence ( PAL ) and don\u2019t have some violent stuff in your past either through a criminal conviction or mental issues which is reviewed by the RCMP after your application. Long gun purchases do not have to be registered ( ie. barrel must be 18 1/2 inches + long ). Semi-automatics cannot have a clip size over 4 cartridges and no rifle can have a clip size more than 10.Handguns are hard to get a licence for and always have been here. If you register as a collector or belong to an approved shooting club handguns aren\u2019t hard to get legally. Barrels no shorter than 4 inches are prohibited and some types, such as \u201c Saturday night specials \u201c ( ( .25 cal usually ) are prohibited. My only point is that I have hunted all kinds of game for years under these laws, have 7 long guns and two handguns at home and I feel quite safe and satisfied, especially since our homicide rate by guns is one tenth that of the US rate and I don\u2019t buy guns to kill people. The cops and the armed forces can do that stuff thank you and someone in my home illegally won\u2019t get too far looking down the barrel of a 12 gauge shotgun.Please reform your gun CONTROL laws for your own sake.P.S.

If they try to reintroduce that money into the American marketplace w/o paying taxes on it, it becomes evasion. Evasion is hard to prove (well, it's expensive and time consuming to prove) and enforce. So a better way to handle it would be enact legislation that makes tax avoidance less appealing. Thing is, Trump kind of sort of said he would close those loopholes. Turns out he was lying about that, too.

It seems like his first argument is that the contents of the emails he's withholding  are not incriminating; rather, the incriminating thing is that the emails he has are incomplete and could not fully comply with the subpoena because the IC has a more complete set, so he's afraid the Committee will charge him for not supplying the complete set (which he says he doesn't even have). Somehow, he thinks that the 5th Amendment's protection against being forced to testify against yourself will also allow him to intentionally withhold some of the requested emails even though they are not incriminating, and even though withholding the emails is the only criminal thing going on. So it seems like he's saying that since the IC somehow has a more complete set of his emails than he himself has (???), if he gives them everything he has, then they will be able to compare it to the complete set, and bring criminal charges for not fully complying. He thinks that the 5th Amendment would therefore allow him to purposefully submit an incomplete set of emails to intentionally obscure the extent to which he would be non-compliant if he had submitted everything he had, thus protecting him against self-incrimination. He's invoking the 5th Amendment as an excuse to withhold the emails so he doesn't incriminate himself, yet the only incriminating aspect of them is that they're being withheld, and if he just gave them everything, there would be no self-incrimination and no need to invoke the 5th at all. Man, that was legitimately very difficult to describe. This is the most bizarre and circular legal theory I've ever seen in my life.His second argument is much easier to understand, and is just as wrong.

All of those commercials you see on tv about auto braking are bs, virtually none of the cars come with them standard, you would need to go up in trim levels to get that function. Think that Outback you see next to you has eyesight braking? Does not come standard except at one trim level which costs $11,000 more than the base model. The base model Outback doesn't even allow you to chose it as an option, you must spend 2k more on a higher trim then add another 2k in for the eyesight which means that is a 4k option which you are now going to pay interest and tax on, so call it $4500.

Penicillins and cephalosporins, especially of low class levels, are not commonly used in human medicine for \"Last-resort\" cases.

Not a real issue.Second, most of the bacterial diseases that afflict animals, and especially those which are most common, are not zoonotic. That is, they do not infect people. For instance, Mannheimia haemolytica, a common infectious organism in cattle does not infect humans. Changes in resistance of this bacterium are not relevant to human medicine. While this isn't the case for ALL disease, it is for most of them. Zoonotic disease are (generally) quite rare and are reported to the government for control when encountered.

The Veterinary Feed Directive was put into action January 1st, 2017 and requires a veterinary prescription for the use of medically important antibiotics to be used in feed/water in food animal species. Previously, farmers could buy antibiotics at the feed store and add them to their animal's rations for production purposes (weight gain, better feed conversion, etc). Now, they must have a Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD), which is basically a prescription, in order to obtain antibiotics to add to their animal's rations for these purposes. The goal of the VFD is to reduce the use of antibiotics used for non-medical purposes due to the rise of antibiotic resistance now seen in humans and animals. I am currently in veterinary school and a HUGE part of our curriculum is \"antimicrobial stewardship\" which means they teach us a lot about using antibiotics judiciously to combat this issue.

So in the rare case of such a disease, we still have several antibiotics available to fight it which it won't be resistant to.  Yes, there are cases of MSRA which seem resistant to almost everything... but these did not come from animals.3.

But that the vetted people who set policy priorities really don't either.Just to.. horribly quickly sum this up: Abe wants, along with a curiously rising amount of others, to change the constitution to allow Japan a military force. The nuclear weapons ban has been on the table several times, and any amount of slow and deliberate talks on an Asian union of some kind has been forcing itself forward, in spite of not all that much will to push that. So what this sort of represents - abstractly - is the off-hand, distanced attitude that legitimizes a US military presence and a requirement for a degree of security cooperation. But also a very firm requirement that Japan needs to assert it's own foundation and intentions separate from that of the US. And while this certainly is welcome for many, and I personally think it is a good precedent for other nations involved in a security cooperation relationship with the US, I still feel a certain amount of worry that reforms that will put some distance between the US and several countries in Asia, and other areas in the same fashion, really, might finally come at the hands of hardliners with Trump as an excuse to drum up more broad political support. I'm not sure it would be a bad thing from a policy point of view, in theory. But you would of course prefer it if a country didn't - which really will be the result, most likely - put up a show of defiance, and then dig itself deeper down in security cooperation. Or, practically, that the country, like Japan, basically enlarges it's military capacity, and becomes involved with American \"defense\" operations in the short term, for diplomatic necessity. While politicians will celebrate certain long-standing goals for self-sufficiency.

[Stanford University, Source on Radiation Exposure Risk to Unborn Children in Hiroshima Post-Nuclear Bombing](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/yapa2/)>Conclusions>The many studies that were conducted after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki determined that some of the risks that the public perceives to be associated with radiation exposure are non-existent, while others are in fact matters of concern. **The cancer risk for children who were in-utero when their mothers were exposed is higher than it would be for others without this exposure, but children who were conceived after their parents were exposed to radiation had no increased cancer risk. Similarly for both birth defects and mental retardation, it was found that in-utero exposure possibly increased the rate of incidence of these conditions, but results from all studies are inconclusive, except for the case of pregnant mothers within 1200m of the hypocenter.** All of the in-utero children born to these mothers experienced mental retardation. All three of these cases found that there is no increased risk of these conditions if the parents of the child were exposed to the ionizing radiation of the atomic bomb (child was not conceived at the time of the exposure).&nbsp;[Radiation Effects Research Foundation, A Cooperative Japan-US Research Organization: Birth defects among the children of atomic-bomb survivors (1948-1954)](http://www.rerf.jp/radefx/genetics_e/birthdef.html)>**No statistically significant increase in major birth defects or other untoward pregnancy outcomes was seen among children of survivors.** Monitoring of nearly all pregnancies in Hiroshima and Nagasaki began in 1948 and continued for six years.

However, we have information from the atomic testing of another country to provide insight: >Despite the promise to \"protect the inhabitants\", from July 1946 through July 1947, the residents of Bikini Atoll who had been relocated to Rongerik Atoll were starving for lack of food. >Scientists calculated in 2010 that during the lifetimes of members of the Marshall Islands population, potentially exposed to ionizing radiation from weapons test fallout deposited during the testing period (1948-1958) and from residual radioactive sources during the subsequent 12 years >The inhabitants of the Marshall Islands, particularly those closest to Bikini Atoll, were exposed to high levels of radiation. The highest levels of radiation exposure were found in the areas of local fallout. The fallout produced from nuclear tests can affect the human populations internally or externally. External irradiation is from penetrating gamma rays that come from particles on the ground. The levels of external radiation exposure can be reduced if one was indoors because buildings act as a shield. Inhalation of radioactive fallout and epidermal absorption are the primary means of irradiation. However most exposure is from consumption of food that has been contaminated through fallout. The people of the islands would consume meat or products from animals that had been irradiated, therefore irradiating the consumer.[59] Food shipped into the islands was also affected by contamination through contaminated cooking utensils. Many dairy products, such as milk and yogurt, were contaminated as a result of radionuclides landing on pastures. Iodine-131, a highly radioactive isotope, was ingested or inhaled by many through various forms. The iodine-131 consumed would become concentrated in one\u2019s thyroid.[60]>On the Marshall Islands, the detonation of Castle Bravo was the cause of most of the radiation exposure to the surrounding populations. The fallout levels attributed to the Castle Bravo test are the highest in history.[59] The exposure to fallout has been linked to increase the likelihood of several types of cancer such as leukemia and thyroid cancer.[58][60] The relationship between I-131 levels and thyroid cancer is continuing to be researched. There are also correlations between fallout exposure levels and diseases such as thyroid disease like hypothyroidism. Populations of the Marshall Islands that received significant exposure to radionuclides have a much greater risk of developing cancer.[60] The Castle Bravo test detonation produced an explosion of approximately 15 megatons, which is about three times its predicted value. Populations neighboring the test site were exposed to high levels of radiation resulting in mild radiation sickness of many (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Several weeks later, many people began suffering from alopecia (hair loss) and skin lesions as well.[61] The female population of the Marshall Islands have a **sixty times [60 FUCKING TIMES] greater cervical cancer mortality than a comparable mainland United States population.**[62] The Islands populations also have a **five time greater likelihood of breast or gastrointestinal mortality, and lung cancer mortality is three times higher than the mainland population.**[62] The male population on the Marshall Islands lung cancer mortality is **four times greater than the overall United States rates, and the oral cancer rates are ten times greater.**[62] There is also a presumed association between radiation levels and female reproductive system functioning.[63]&nbsp;Edit: Just FYI, the Castle Bravo detonation was 15 MT TNT equivalent, compared to estimates of NK's detonation which are on the order of <0.2 MT.  Castle Bravo was also an atmospheric test, which at the time, drew sharp criticism from the international community including some from its allies.Also, 23 Japanese fishermen were irradiated in the blast, marking it the third occurrence of the US irradiating Japanese, the other two being of course Hiroshima and Nagasaki.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 138353, "comment_id": "dph6pb7", "score": 27, "submission_time": "Tue Nov  7 18:44:42 2017", "ups": 27}, {"body": "I don't like NK regime but we all need to draw a line and have a clear definition of what are news and what are just rumors.
