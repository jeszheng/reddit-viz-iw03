Evolution because we have seen it fail, so we know how these things fail. Evolving tech, because its necessary. The block-chain is now the leading tech for all things \"decentralized\". Decentralization is the technological goal of socialism. With AI coming to being automated systems will only need maintenance. Management, design, new ideas, all those things will come from AI.  We didn't have these technology before, we didn't have such failures before they failed. Thus you can't expect improvement in society if all we know is a badly working system such as the consumer driven republic. In the USA, you don't actually vote for president! a few guys get together and they decide. We don't get to vote on laws... Some guys get together and decide for us. We banned alcohol for what 10 years? and then made it legal and regulated...Why? People change their minds. Only that the electoral college exists to help us come to a decision since we don't have computers to help... actually do we have computers now that I think about it while typing on one.  So computer systems along with AI, the block-chain, automation, etc will eventually and slowly change our society into a place where there is not much to do. So that will collapse the economies of the world and we will only be able to realize that democracy is what we want minus the economy. The economy is basically a game where people make money and spend money, while creating more money by using people to work. Work is money. In the game there are winner and loosers, and some people's work is worth less than other people's. For example, with my BS in engineering, I only make maybe 1 millionth of what a basketball player makes. But more realistically, my boss who doesn't suffer as much as I do, probably makes twice or more as I do. However my job is safer since they need the slave and not the slave driver.  So its just a game. I make  like 4 times more than my parents combined. That makes no sense to me because I lived with these people, they worked so hard! and yet, no pension, no healthcare, not much to show for, and always living in fear that one day the job will end. Its crazy.

In the 19th century it was largely the English, German, and French empires, and today that role is dominated by the United States.Pretty much every single libertarian-socialist society has ended up absolutely steamrolled by these Empires.  See the Paris Commune or Anarchist Spain for the most prevalent examples.  So in 1917 after seeing numerous other revolutions fail because the Empire shows up with guns and tanks and vast, well supplied armies - Vladimir Lenin decides to put a spin on Marxist philosophy that comes to be known as Marxist-Leninist philosophy.  This idea is far more authoritarian, leading to all those \"dictator\" and \"totalitarian\" claims leveled at all the 20th century communist states, because Lenin's idea was (among a lot of other things) that the only way to match the state power of the empire is with state power of your own.Lenin felt that if he didn't immediately start mass producing tanks and guns and military out the ass (even at the expense of actual socialism) then his revolution, too, would end up steamrolled by the empires.  Instead, the highly militaristic Soviet Union became the first socialist state capable of withstanding the imperial onslaught, so its success became a model for many subsequent socialist states and uprisings.It's gets more complicated than this, but understand that socialism has never, ever, had a real opportunity to establish itself in peaceful conditions.  Anywhere in the world, as soon as a country leans a bit too far left, it is immediately met with sanctions, embargoes, coups, assassinations, death squads, or even outright invasion sponsored by one of the aforementioned empires.  It's hard to change civilization while simultaneously fighting for your life.Nonetheless, societies like Cuba, or even parts of the USSR have shown that, even in the Marxist-Leninist hell of unending resistance to the empires, that you can provide healthcare, food, education, and employment for all, reach full literacy, contribute groundbreaking scientific research to humanity, and eliminate poverty all within a generation, *even while locked in mortal combat with much larger and more powerful empires that dominate the globe.*  ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 158699, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 23:49:04 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "Don't confuse the two.

Of course, he is gay but I would like to see a world where he can be himself - it doesn't harm anyone else. That said, years ago I saw 2 other men in public (separately), dressed as women. It was obvious that their clothing came from thrift stores as they were decades out of date and not even pretty. One of the men had tried to grow his hair long but he was unfortunately balding. It broke my heart. You could just tell that these men had had a rough go of it their entire lives - had not found success in their working lives and were so brave to put themselves out there in spite of the poor public response. If it were in my power to give anyone a makeover of their dreams - it would be these folks.

Essentially the social planner has to figure out how to balance everyone's demands efficiently which is far easier said than done. In a market economy, however, economic actors make their own decisions on how much to buy, sell, produce, etc. This leads to the emergence of price mechanisms to bring the supply and demand for goods and services to a rough equilibrium where producers are selling about the amount of a good that consumers want to purchase. These emergent mechanisms and processes are often referred to as the Invisible Hand. That is, economic actors acting independently are better able to satisfy each other's demands than any single social planner. Pure capitalism has its fair share of issues too, though, primarily the erosion of workers' rights and poor incentives for corporations to take actions that are socially responsible. Most economies are mixed, with aspects of capitalism and socialism. America is a mixed economy that is much closer to capitalism, whereas somewhere like Sweden is a bit more towards the socialist side of the spectrum. So in short, pure socialism and pure capitalism both kind of suck for differing reasons.

To make new friends in person, you have to put yourself out there, you have to put in the effort and you have to be open to trying new things. Look for opportunities to meet new people in your city. Check your city calendar for events, look at popular places or spots you like to go websites for their event calendars. Check meetup for groups that do things you like to do. Many cities have adult coed sport leagues that you can sign up for. When you go out to these events, do go out with the goal that you will make a new friend that day. Because if you dont, you may get discouraged and may stop if you dont make friends the first couple of times out. Instead go out with the goal that you are going to start a couple conversations with the people there. Just get more comfortable talking to new people.

These chips are in a sense more comparable to common processors, but still they behave completely different and need a lot of specially designed hardware to function (for example a cryostat)These are just two examples and there are still other proposed ways to build a quantum computer but they all involve specially designed hardware to be able to control and shield the qubits", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 01:49:27 2017", "ups": 3}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72h2tc/how_does_the_hardware_for_quantum_computers/", "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "> but I thought neutron stars were uncharged and just made of, well, neutrons?Neutron stars are, in spite of their names, not made entirely out of neutrons.

(Barnes et al 2005)  There's genomic analysis done that shows that the tissue from an infantile haemangioma is basically identical to placental tissue.  That Barnes et al paper puts it as, \"the view of placenta as \u2018tumor\u2019 and hemangioma as its \u2018metastasis.\u2019\"  There's also an association between transcervical chorionic villus sampling, placenta praevia, premature birth and preeclampsia, which all cause cells to be shed from the placenta.And the other theory is a mutation in an individual endothelial (blood vessel wall) cell, which causes it to replicate rapidly in a clonal (all the same, rather than differentiating to perform different roles) manner - basically a tumour.  Science has no idea why this might originally happen - just the luck of the DNA-mutation lottery, probably - but why's it so prevalent, and why only in babies, and why do they go away?  Possibly associated with higher renin levels during early infancy, which drop as a child gets older.  There are also higher renin levels in the groups in which we see the highest incidence of infantile haemangiomas (female babies, Caucasian babies, and premature babies).

Here, a \"state\" could include a whole superconductor or superfluid.Then, if the state is moving with some velocity V, and encounters some sort of impurities, it would need to slow down by creating some excitation in the opposite direction. But during this whole process, you need to simultaneously conserve momentum and energy (energy can be lost to heat in the surroundings, but it cannot be generated). This leads to the \"Landau criterion.\" If you simply set up momentum conservation and energy conservation (or at least, a lack of energy generation), you get a set of equations which show that the state cannot slow down unless its velocity is large enough. This is what is seen in superfluids and superconductors: with a large enough superflow, you do get viscosity, but if it is too slow to create an excitation you cannot slow the state down.An explanation with more math can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/3ha3ww/so_why_are_superconductors_superconducting/cu5nb44/).Maybe an even more cartoonish picture. For a superconductor, you need to *break* a Cooper pair (a bound state of two electrons) to create an excitation to slow down a superflow.

The superconductivity/superfluidity is a characteristic of this quantum state.  If the impurities that would give you friction are weak enough not to destroy this state, they can only weakly perturbe this state to be slightly different. However they can not change the fact that most of the e.g. electrons are in the same quantum state. And when you see 0 resistance you see the characteristic of this quantum state which still survives as a macroscopic object.Classical resistivity in materials, as an example is a result of single electrons dispersing on impurities. This story is not true for the macroscopic quantum state because all of the electrons in the quantum state somehow feel the impurity and adapt to it still to have 0 resistance. If the impurities e.g. make some electrons leave the macroscopic quantum state, they would feel friction, but this does not matter if the quantum state exists because in a way you could say that you have a 0 resistance parallely connected to a nonzero resistance and your overall resistance is still 0.

Here, a \"state\" could include a whole superconductor or superfluid.Then, if the state is moving with some velocity V, and encounters some sort of impurities, it would need to slow down by creating some excitation in the opposite direction. But during this whole process, you need to simultaneously conserve momentum and energy (energy can be lost to heat in the surroundings, but it cannot be generated). This leads to the \"Landau criterion.\" If you simply set up momentum conservation and energy conservation (or at least, a lack of energy generation), you get a set of equations which show that the state cannot slow down unless its velocity is large enough. This is what is seen in superfluids and superconductors: with a large enough superflow, you do get viscosity, but if it is too slow to create an excitation you cannot slow the state down.An explanation with more math can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/3ha3ww/so_why_are_superconductors_superconducting/cu5nb44/).Maybe an even more cartoonish picture. For a superconductor, you need to *break* a Cooper pair (a bound state of two electrons) to create an excitation to slow down a superflow. This takes finite energy, so for small enough velocities, the flow continues.

He paid for 100% of his medical costs out of his pocket, or didn't.  If he didn't, the child suffered or died.

People like him fought to weaken the ACA.  In a proper single payer system, the subsidy would be much higher and the burden on this family much lower.  But it certainly isn't the ACA's fault that it improved this guy's life a whole lot but still left him with fairly high bills.And naturally, under any of the Republican bills, the subsidies for this guy go away.

I think it's fair to say that there **are** problems with the ACA. There's a coverage gap where people make too much money to receive subsidies but are still unable to afford their premiums and deductibles. But for every person that is worse off due to the ACA there are many more that are now able to have insurance of any kind. Instead of completely scrapping the protections afforded by the ACA and 'starting over', the GOP needs to actually work with Dems to shore up and improve it for as many as possible. > Moreover, it\u2019s unclear whether Griffon would find himself much better off under a repeal plan, especially because he has a child with a pre-existing condition who could find herself priced entirely out of the market.

He paid for 100% of his medical costs out of his pocket, or didn't.  If he didn't, the child suffered or died.  The system shrugged - should have been born richer, or without a chronic medical condition.Under Obamacare, the government is picking up a big part of his medical costs.  It's not \"unexpected event insurance\" - these costs are predictable, chronic, and high.  It's just a subsidy, for people like him.Now, the subsidy may not be enough.  People like him fought to weaken the ACA.  In a proper single payer system, the subsidy would be much higher and the burden on this family much lower.  But it certainly isn't the ACA's fault that it improved this guy's life a whole lot but still left him with fairly high bills.And naturally, under any of the Republican bills, the subsidies for this guy go away.

I think it's fair to say that there **are** problems with the ACA. There's a coverage gap where people make too much money to receive subsidies but are still unable to afford their premiums and deductibles. But for every person that is worse off due to the ACA there are many more that are now able to have insurance of any kind. Instead of completely scrapping the protections afforded by the ACA and 'starting over', the GOP needs to actually work with Dems to shore up and improve it for as many as possible. > Moreover, it\u2019s unclear whether Griffon would find himself much better off under a repeal plan, especially because he has a child with a pre-existing condition who could find herself priced entirely out of the market.

A and I quickly became good friends, but we had never met in person. We met over Facebook and hit it off, so we kept talking. For the first three or so years, it was a lot of fun talking to him. He was so supportive and caring, we got along famously and had a great friendship. In March of 2015, his mom suddenly passed away from an aneurysm. He happened to hear her fall out of bed and tried to perform CPR, but was unsuccessful. Through his grieving process I was constantly on the phone with him, trying my best to be supportive and allow him to grieve. In July of 2015, I was accepted to university in the city. I told him about the news and he was happy for me, but started getting very negative and saying that we \"probably won't talk once I get to university.\" I moved into my apartment in the city on September 4th, and when I told him, he suddenly told me that apparently he had moved to the *exact same city as me* only four days earlier. He hadn't mentioned anything about this in the previous months, and I found it a little strange. At first he wouldn't tell me where he lived in the city, which actually made me paranoid because I had told him where I was living before moving. I started feeling really weird at this point and wasn't sure what to make of him keeping his location, and the fact that he moved to the same city as me, a secret. He began to say strange things to me and act very out of character.One night I was skyping my now ex-boyfriend, and I happened to talk about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Two minutes later I randomly got a text message from A asking me if I liked Buffy. I was so scared and freaked out that I had to stop the Skype call. It was just too much of a coincidence.Things got progressively worse. In October of 2015 we decided to finally meet in person. We went to a coffee place and it was all well and good. We actually had a good time and it seemed the waters had settled. We spent about four hours together, but I had to go home to finish up an assignment. He called me several hours later and started accusing me of wanting to leave because I was apparently \"uncomfortable\" the entire time. Which was not the case whatsoever, I actually felt fairly relaxed. This caused a major fight between us.I began to catch him in small white lies, but the first major lie was when I broke up with my boyfriend after Christmas. I texted A to say what had happened and I really needed his support --- but he randomly disappeared for three days. When I finally called him out on ignoring me and not being there for me when I needed him, he replied ten minutes later and said that he had \"been in a car accident that put him in a coma for three days, and the nurses just gave him back his phone.\" I was so mad and knew he was lying right away, even going as far as to check the accident reports on the highway that he said he was on. Nothing at all came up.We ended up mending things in January, but he suddenly became distant. In February he mentioned something about finishing his \"security course\" and I was flabbergasted because he had *never* mentioned anything about it previously. He told me that he had, but I know for certain that he didn't. He told me the course was only something like 14 weeks, and he was about to go to his first placement. He said that he would be doing campus security, and immediately I panicked because I was afraid that he was going to randomly show up on my campus. Trying to edge around the question, I asked where it was. Luckily it was a different campus, but he mentioned how he had requested to go to mine but they declined. In the summer we met up again in about June of 2016, and had a great time walking around the city and catching Pokemon. He went on to tell me later that night that he had feelings for me and wanted us to be a couple. I politely declined and said that I didn't have feelings for him at all. I made this very clear and there was no beating around the bush. He proceeded to cry and beg me to be with him, quickly resorting to the \"I'm a nice guy and that's why you don't want to be with me\" speech. It was so aggravating that he couldn't take no for an answer.Over the course of the summer, his behaviour got worse. He began saving all of my pictures on snapchat as well as facebook, and started talking illicitly to me about sex. He would go on to tell me his dreams he had about me. At this point I started to really distance myself from him.I began a FWB relationship with another man, which A took very harshly. He constantly began comparing himself to my FWB and talking bad about him.A and I continued to fight nonstop, even going long periods of time without speaking to each other due to fighting. In January of 2017, I moved into a new apartment and after, once again, making amends with A, invited him over for the first time. He overstayed his welcome and would always sit way too close to me, which always made me uncomfortable.For his birthday in February, I invited him over and made him a cake and dinner. It was fun at first but then I broke down and confessed that I was severely depressed and would be taking a hiatus from university to go back home to my parents in order to get better. He was more upset at the fact that I hadn't bothered to inform him and started accusing me of keeping secrets and lying about who I was.Over the next few months, we fought like crazy. We would go weeks where we would only fight. He had begged me to come see him in August after an exam (I was taking online courses through the summer) and I caved.After my exam I came over to his place and because we would be drinking, I would have to stay the night. We got very, very drunk and high, but we still had fun for the first 9 hours together. Later that night I got a horrible migraine (I am frequently plagued by them) and laid down on the couch and passed out. I would try to wake up and would feel him massaging my feet, then the next time I tried to wake up he was stroking my ass, and then I couldn't wake up again until morning. At 7am I finally came to, and felt very sick and weirded out. My clothes were askew but I knew they hadn't been removed through the night. I don't know what else he did through the night, but he didn't penetrate me. He was now sleeping in his own room.I quickly gathered my things and waited for him to wake up, where I told him I had to go home because I had a three hour drive. He got physically upset and started *literally* pouting, and accused me of lying to him again. He went on and on, called me a bitch amongst other things, and said that I didn't actually want to be friends with him. I caved and stayed for another twenty minutes before finally getting out of there.I felt very, very weird about the situation but I didn't want to talk about it with anyone (and still haven't with anyone besides all of you). Finally I confronted A about his behaviour and he called me a slut, and proceeded to never talk to me again. I blocked him off of all social media and blocked his phone number. We haven't talked since.I feel so violated but I cannot talk to anyone else about this. This is the first time I've even written the entirety of the situation out, and I still skimmed over things.7 years of my life was wasted on this guy who claimed to be my \"best friend,\" and all I'm left with is this disgusting feeling. I don't know what all happened that night, but I can only just begin to imagine.As a rape survivor, I once again feel my safety and boundaries have been violated.

Please don't scroll further if you feel that reading this stuff might adversely affect you and your mood. Instead, go look at [this adorable cat hug](https://i.imgur.com/hQbX5De.gif).]Hello folks! Um, I was hoping to get some advice from people who either have suffered from sexual assault or interacted with those who have.  I became friends with this girl from school about a year ago and in that time we've grown closer than I would've ever imagined was possible. Yeah, I know, people believe that young love doesn't last and stuff, but she also happens to be my best friend, and I'd like to help her regardless. One of the reasons why we became such close friends so fast is because we both have a _lot_ of crap going on at home. Broken families and the like.Please keep in mind that the following is what I've pieced together over about 8 months or so in fragments, since she doesn't really talk about this stuff. I only got to know the more grave details a couple of days ago. I'll try to put in everything that I can here, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to provide you with more details, simply because I don't know them myself:She was sexually abused (for a prolonged period of time; several months) when she was about 8 or 9 years old by an older cousin. She says that he used to cut her with a knife and \"shoved rods up her vagina\" and, uh, ruptured her uterus so she can never have kids. Needless to say, her uterus is very sensitive. A month ago the lining somehow tore, and she has been bleeding continuously since. Doctors say that the only option is to hope for a miracle and let her uterus self-heal, and here's the thing, _she can't have sex for at least a few years_. Probably more than a just few years. (Also, I don't know the exact terminology for the body parts so please pardon any technical mistakes)I honestly don't care all that much. Would I have liked to have had sex with her? Yes, obviously. Is it a deal breaker that she cannot? Nah. She says that she feels guilty that she'll be holding me back from experiences, even though I try to comfort her and tell her that we'll have different kinds of experiences and stuff, but she still says that she hates the fact that she'll be holding me back from stuff when I'm always there for her.Also, she feels guilty that she didn't tell her mom when it happened (she still hasn't) because apparently it could have been cured then, she was just a kid, and I try to comfort her, but still. Her parents know about her uterus being ruptured now, but not about the rape. This has also led to her shutting almost everyone out, and not trusting anyone. It took me months to convince her to go talk to the school counselor about stuff, but she still hasn't told the counselor about this, and I doubt that she will. I'm the only one who knows all this.Honestly, I'm just at a loss about what to do. She constantly says that she feels dead inside and that she doesn't want to live. I've fortunately managed to help with the suicidal thoughts, but I still don't know what else to do. I'm always there for her, and she knows this, but she has days when she just hates herself and everyone else, and I'm just at a loss for gestures or stuff to say.I'm posting here because I have literally nowhere else to go to. I'm seriously afraid that one day stuff will really get to her (stuff at her home is not good at all either) and she'll just snap and do something drastic to the point of no return like overdose on antidepressants (she's done that in the past).IDK, I don't even know where I was going with this anymore, I guess, if any of you has gone through stuff like this or know someone who has, how do you think I can improve stuff for her, and make her happier and see the good in life?Thanks.PS: I have an exam in the morning and I promised her that I'd study. I'll check back later.Edit: Sorry for the long post, I guess I just had too much that I needed to let out.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "72lutx", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "How do I (16M) help my girlfriend (16F) who was raped as a kid?", "num_comments": 4, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 0, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 1, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/72lutx/how_do_i_16m_help_my_girlfriend_16f_who_was_raped/", "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 21:16:39 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "She needs professional help, especially if she's been having suicidal thoughts.

So far I'm alright with the way things are going and I love the food they serve. However, within the past month, I've noticed that there is something not quite right with on of my managers. I kinda felt it the day that I had an interview with him, but I passed it off as misjudgment. I've heard within the second month of working at the restaurant that my coworkers weren't really fond of him. Now his behavior within the past month has up until this point makes me sick to be anywhere near him. The first incident happened after I had a nervous break down when the restaurant had one of its busiest days since I started working there. The manager, whom I will refer to as Frank, came all the way from his home to talk to me and tried to make me feel better. He then brought up a scenario that I was dating him and would I give up on the relationship if I freaked out. I don't know if that was supposed to be helpful, but something in my gut told me to get the hell out of that room as soon as possible. The guy is in his late 40s, is married and has a teenaged kid. Since then I found every reason that I could to not be around him so often. Not even a week later, one of my coworkers mentioned to me that the other day he was staring at her while she put her make up on in her car for 10 minutes. After she got out he told her she looked sexy while doing that. Since that incident I've been recording all his inappropriate behaviours. The worst incident that I've recorded so far was about me and one other coworker. He stated that I was really smart so he was done with my other female coworkers and he wanted me now. With that and my other six incident I felt like I could file a decent complaint. Today, I found out the worst possible news I could've heard. I went in to get food from the restaurant, but then I ended up getting called into my manager's office. I was told one of my coworkers got fired, but right before he was about to be let go he told Frank that I was spreading rumors that he led me to one of the bathrooms and started kissing me and touching me inappropriately. I felt like I was gonna puke in that moment. Everything I've accumulated in the past month had gone to waste. I would have told the owner that he didn't do that and confess the incidents to him, but Frank was in the same room with him so I was too afraid to speak up. Soon after the questioning I was handed a blank sheet of paper and told to write down that Frank did not sexually harass me. I don't know why I didn't refuse, maybe because I panicked, but now I feel like I waived my right to say that he said inappropriate things to me and my coworkers. I'm afraid to go into work whenever he's there. I either have to expose him now, or deal with his behaviour for as long as I'll be working there. At this point I don't really know what else to do. Anyone else that has experienced this or worse, my heart goes out to you guys. If anyone has any advice for this, I'dbe more than grateful to hear it.Tl;DRMy manager is a creep so I recorded all his inappropriate incidents, but my now ex coworker fucked it up for me so I ended up defending said manager.
