Female beauty standards change a LOT over time, and are often for things that are not alterable via diet & exercise without also gaining \"undesirable\" traits.  For example, you can't diet your way into larger breasts without risking tummy flab, and you likely can't get your body fat low enough for a flat stomach without shrinking your breasts.  2. A lot of the heavy criticism of impossible standards of female beauty came around when the \"fashionable\" female figure was incredibly slender, and any woman who wasn't 20-30 pounds underweight could expect to be called fat.  Look at what happened when Amber Benson joined the cast of Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- rather than anyone recognizing that most of the female cast was incredibly tiny, she got called a fat cow by fans CONSTANTLY.  At the time she was 5'4\" and 120 pounds, iirc, maybe even 115.  3. There are entire categories of concern men get to skip, like expectations regarding makeup.  This is a HUGE part of it, because it means that an \"attractive face\" for a woman is something that requires a daily re-do and skill.  4. Hair.  Beauty standards for women tend to involve haircuts and hairstyles that require daily styling.5. Editing this one in, since another of your comments reminded me of it -- women are expected to look young well into middle or old age to be considered sexy.  Men are allowed to age -- the \"People magazine sexiest man\" award you were talking about?  Has been won by guys with grey hair (Sean Conery), guys with receeding hair, guys with no hair, guys with wrinkles, etc.  In short, why are women's beauty standards considered impossible?  The average woman is literally incapable of meeting them.  The standards are contradictory (no visible body fat but large breasts), the standards are dangerous and prone to (diet your way to maintaining a BMI under 18.5), and the standards require 30-60 minutes of work every day in order to be considered \"presentable\".", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 44014, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Fri Oct  6 06:10:27 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "Plenty of girls have flat stomach, and flat butt, and flat che...you get the idea.

HOWEVER. I do have a problem with birth control being free through insurance by law. If an insurer wants to make birth control no-copay, that's fine. The reason I have a problem with it is this:My husband has a chronic, incurable, debilitating medical condition that renders him unable to function in normal society without SERIOUS prescription drugs. We have spent ridiculous amounts of time and money finding insurance companies that cover the medication that allows him to live a \"normal\" life (still doesn't come close to normal). At one point we were spending 150 every month for one prescription because there was no generic until June of this year, and no insurance company covered it for less than that, if at all. We have since had the choice of paying ridiculous insurance premiums for a lower copay, or medium premiums for a ridiculous copay...all because of ONE drug. There is no in-between. NOW, what I mean by all of this is...without this medicine, my husband could not hold up a job, could not do ANYTHING. Women do not need birth control to support their families, to be able to get up and drive to work, to keep staying ALIVE...and the stakes are MUCH lower. Birth control is, on its own, without insurance, infinitely cheaper than medicines people need just to keep living. My husband didn't ask for his condition, and it hurts to go to the pharmacy every month knowing that I could get birth control for free, but we need to go bankrupt just so he can keep living. I hope that makes sense. Edit: words from typing fast and being frustrated.

And that again narrows things down to very Earth-like planets.Also, there's nothing stopping us from looking for signs of life in other planets we detect, but without going out of our way to detect Earth-like planets they would not necessarily have been found very quickly, because they are a bit harder to detect than some other types (like hot Jupiters).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 111569, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 02:05:05 2017", "ups": 2}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/74ngz6/in_the_search_of_exoplanets_why_exactly_are_we/", "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "The main theorems and proofs we see today are not what would have been seen when the ideas were first coming around.

These pioneers founded the first German settlement in America: Germantown, Pennsylvania, the first American community to formally protest the evils of slavery. Since this auspicious beginning, millions of German immigrants have come to our Nation in pursuit of personal and religious freedoms and economic opportunity. These immigrants and their descendants have changed the trajectory of the United States, and on German\u2011American Day, we celebrate their role in helping our country thrive.The more than 44 million Americans who claim German heritage join previous generations in making important contributions to every facet of American life. As the proud grandson of German grandparents, I am keenly aware of how German Americans have helped drive our economy, enrich our culture, and protect and defend the land they embrace as their own. Notable German-American leaders in business and finance include William Boeing, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Heinz, and Milton S. Hershey. Many others, such as Neil Armstrong, George Herman \"Babe\" Ruth Jr., Walt Disney, Amelia Earhart, and the inimitable \"Dr. Seuss\" (Theodor Seuss Geisel) have become beloved figures. German Americans Chester Nimitz, John Pershing, and Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. are among the most decorated military officers in American history. American painters of German descent include Emanuel Leutze, best known for his classic work Washington Crossing the Delaware, and Albert Bierstadt, whose canvas captured the majestic beauty of the American West. German Americans have also designed some of the most iconic landmarks in the United States, including Johann August Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge. Even the quintessential American hot dog owes a debt to German immigrant Charles Feltman, who debuted the savory treat when he opened the first hot dog stand at Coney Island.Today, the United States and Germany enjoy a close relationship through our shared history and common interests. As our Nation's largest ancestry group, German Americans are rightfully proud of how their deep cultural, historical, and familial ties have helped strengthen this robust transatlantic relationship. A strong partnership between the United States and Germany is vital to ensuring that we live in a peaceful world filled with vibrant economic opportunities for all.*NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2017, as German-American Day.

If you disagree, feel free to comment, this post's purpose is for a discussion for different view points.Though in no particular order, the first most common argument I hear is, 'I'm not a feminist because I'm not...' and they would make reference to the feminists they don't like, be it the red haired lady, the 'triggered' lady so on and so forth. I find this problematic because, why dissociate oneself from a movement you care about just because there are people you don't like who are in the movement or what have you. I say three to four points because this point often gets tied into 'what is feminism' and while I have my view on what feminism is, too many ignore the multiple viewpoints of what feminism is and only put what they believe as feminism, 'ie man hating', as the truth of feminism. The second is the notion that 'we don't need feminism in the west'. Granted, this is based on my experience, but those who claim feminism isn't needed in the west often say they don't see the need because 'misogyny doesn't exist'. 'I am all for women working,' or 'I love a strong women' so on and so forth. What they fail to realize, is that though it may be true for them, and perhaps for their demographic, such as where they live etc. etc. doesn't mean that misogyny doesn't exist. Thirdly, a common argument people make is 'why not simply egalitarian'. This I don't have a problem with in it and of itself, but sometimes when I talk about feminist issues, it turns into a 'who is more oppressed discussion'. It also devolves into a 'male privilege' issue. People get defensive about male privilege, claiming 'well I grew up poor' etc. as if male privilege is a bad thing. Lastly, those who claim they are not a feminist because of biology. \"Women should not go into military because of biology. women are weaker, or even, men cannot function properly when a women is around\". Not only do I disagree with this factual statement, but the key issue I want to talk about is, 'are we really slaves to are biology'? For example, even if it's true that 'men cannot function properly around women', I am sure we can train ourselves to go beyond. Look at monks who meditate days without food. (Though I don't think it's healthy, that's besides the point.) The point is, we most definitely can ignore our biology, in my opinion. On a side note, there are people who say 'no one says this and that' which is again problematic or 'well that's not the majority. the majority doesn't think xyz religious fanatic thoughts'. Majority or not, they do exist, and I think by ignoring it or saying 'we anti feminists aren't like this' is the same thing as my first point.Thank you for the read. For those who agree with me, what are your experiences like? For those who disagree, again, let me know your thoughts.

One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.Revolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.Importantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone\u2019s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone\u2019s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.Argumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.As feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women\u2019s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women\u2019s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women\u2019s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.By the late \u201870s women\u2019s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women\u2019s studies were fired because they had master\u2019s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women\u2019s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women\u2019s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.Whereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women\u2019s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women\u2019s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.Suddenly more and more women began to either call themselves \u201cfeminists\u201d or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.Without the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a \u201cvictim\u201d of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a \u201cfeminist.\u201d Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.By the early \u201880s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.Feminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men\u2019s movement. Often men\u2019s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "74m085", "gilded": 0, "stickied": true, "title": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: \"Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000)", "num_comments": 1, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 697, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/74m085/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_3_consciousnessraising/", "submission_time": "Fri Oct  6 10:58:30 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "**[Part 1 - Come closer to feminism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/73yq84/hooked_on_bell_hooks_come_closer_to_feminism_from/)****[Part 2 - Feminist politics - where we stand](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74ekcz/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_2_feminist_politics/)**", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 23, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Fri Oct  6 10:59:40 2017", "ups": 1}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74m085/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_3_consciousnessraising/", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": ">  According to the World Economic Forum's study of more than a dozen advanced economies, for every twenty jobs lost to automation, men working in STEM will see five new jobs and women just one.

It\u2019s really hard for me to type so I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s poorly written or vague.Background:  My boyfriend and I have been dating since the summer after our freshman year in high school and we\u2019re now seniors - so we just celebrated 2 years in June. He\u2019s my best friend and I love him a lot, we\u2019ve talked about getting married, etc etc. I have some issues with anxiety and really low self-esteem, and I tend to have trouble relating the way I treat others to the way I should be treated (feeling like others deserve more respect/priority/whatever than I do).Last night, I was at his house, we were... being intimate, I guess. I mean we were having sex. We had started off cuddling, then we were making out. I told him I just wanted to go down on him, and of course he didn\u2019t complain. After a little while, he kind of pulled me up and initiated \u201csex sex.\u201d Even though I had said I just wanted to do something else, I was enjoying myself. But all of a sudden, I got really uncomfortable, and I got up and moved away (I was on top of him). I was lying down putting my jeans back on when he kind of got on top of me. I told him, \u201cI\u2019m putting my pants on,\u201d trying to say that I was done without being mean. I thought I was being clear... then he said something. I thought he said \u201cno\u201d but he tells me that what he really said was \u201cI know.\u201d Either way, he pushed my legs up and started doing what he wanted to be doing, I guess. My jeans were halfway on and he was really close on top of me, so I felt really claustrophobic and uncomfortable. But I didn\u2019t want to make a scene and make him feel bad, so I sort of just stayed quiet and closed my eyes.After a little while (it felt like forever but I guess it was only a few seconds) he picked up on the fact that I wasn\u2019t \u201cinto it.\u201d He asked me if I was okay, I didn\u2019t answer. He asked - and I really respect this - he asked \u201cconsent, yes or no?\u201d I shrugged, and he took that as a no. He pulled away. I told him, \u201cI was just putting my pants on.\u201d He tried to cuddle with me but I was really really uncomfortable and anxious. We were talking about it and he said that he thought I was teasing when I said I was putting my pants on, and I didn\u2019t stop him... I don\u2019t know. He thinks I should have been clearer. I could barely look at him after that, much less touch him. I just felt sick.As I was getting in the car to drive home, I started crying and I couldn\u2019t stop. I cried the whole way home. That was last night, and I still just feel so... gross. Icky. I feel sick. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.I\u2019m going on a church retreat this weekend... I\u2019m glad. It\u2019ll be good to have a little space, I think.What\u2019s going on?? Whose fault is this? I should have been clearer but I don\u2019t know... why is this bothering me so much?

In November, I got pregnant at 21 years old with a man who I was very much in love with. I imagined spending my life with this person, he was my first love my everything. My period was a day late, and I had been feeling super strange and so even without taking the test I was pregnant. I took the test just to confirm, twice and I was about 4 weeks along from my calculations. My whole world was upside down, I\u2019d always wanted this, to be a mother. I felt so protective and strange about this little life inside of me but what was I going to do? One year into college, on a student visa in a country that is not my own, with a very unstable life.So then I told my SO,  he reacted as I expected he would, he cried and told me he was scared and he seemed quite upset. The day that I told him, he had to go work for his mom and I was alone which is fine because I didn\u2019t want to ask him to not go to work because of me. Later in the night I called him and discovered he didn\u2019t have to go to work last minute and instead he was at his friends house playing video games and getting high (he used to smoke weed a lot) So that night I felt the most despair and isolation I\u2019ve ever felt. And obviously disappointment. Over the next two weeks we discussed and weighed our options and he came to the conclusion that he didn\u2019t want to keep it, he said things like he wanted to be married to me and he didn\u2019t want people to think we got married cause I was pregnant, and he wanted time with just me.. etc.. Honestly I knew it was because he didn\u2019t want to give up his lifestyle with his friends and his car and his weed. So I scheduled the abortion, and went through with it in the most zombie like mind set I\u2019ve ever been in. I was between a rock and a hard place, would I make the man I love resent me and this baby? Or would I give up this baby to make him happy and for us to have a future and have babies later?The months following were the darkest of my life, and I was so depressed and dependent on him. The more I needed him the more he withdrew, all our plans of a house and a future were slowly fading away. I should also mention that throughout our relationship his ex never stopped messaging him, and appearing in our lives, I was so paranoid but he always said he loved me and wanted to be with me.So now I\u2019m here, my baby would be three months old and last night I had a dream about it. He was beautiful and chubby and bright. And my ex is now with his ex.. moral of the story is it\u2019s YOUR body and your life, if you\u2019re not sure you can live with an abortion but you can live with a baby and you have the resources to do it alone. I recommend it because now I struggle and I\u2019m in pain, and I\u2019m fighting very hard to understand why this had to happen to me. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m not a victim, I\u2019m stronger and more independent and I have a very productive and good life right now but I just wish that I had been an advocate for myself and my values. Please if you\u2019re struggling, message me or talk to someone you trust. Because sometimes the person you\u2019re in a relationship with, isn\u2019t the best thing for you and you won\u2019t realize it if you keep telling yourself youre paranoid and crazy.

Sometimes she is a 1950\u2019s housewife, sometimes more of a manic pixie dream girl. This character actually goes so far as to buy another woman\u2019s time for in-the-flesh sex. (An amazing scene, by the way, I was riveted.) She is remarkably curt to the woman she hired, which makes sense as she is literally just a computer program that exists to serve her owner, and likely has no space in her programming for politeness or general decency for other people. -Oh, that in-the-flesh sex worker? She is just using the Blade Runner! That\u2019s right, a woman using sex to manipulate her partner! Does she have a name? I can\u2019t remember. It wasn\u2019t important. At least she doesn\u2019t get brutally murdered. In fact, she\u2019s apparently part of a secret underground army! Cool! What part does she play? What\u2019s her backstory? Is she really just personally interested in having replicant babies? Who knows. Her character isn\u2019t developed other than what is directly needed for the plot.-Luv, the replicant assistant. She has a name, so we know she\u2019s important. She is bad with people, unusual for a female character. But she likes to kick ass and wants to be \u201cthe best\u201d, so at least we have that going for us. She pretends to be a harmless and servile replicant, and honestly she isn\u2019t great at pretending. She has some anger and competition problems, and seemingly enjoys killing others. We see her crush a man\u2019s spine, kill the policewoman, casually launch rockets at a half dozen people, and later shoot another woman in the head. She also has a pretty great fight scene with the Blade Runner where she uses some sharp curvy knives reminiscent of that adamantium fingernail lady in the X Men movies. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this woman fights like a badass. But she also has more human flaws. It\u2019s difficult to say exactly what emotions drive her. Jealousy? Anger? A need to impress her boss? Personal drive to overcome perceived injustice of replicant subservience? (Or perhaps female subservience? That last one is my guess, anyway.) Either way, she shows apparent cruelty more than once, in her speech while killing the police woman, when she crushes the hard drive containing hologram  girl, and when she shoots replacement Rachel replicant in front of Deckard. At least in the first two cases, these actions are unnecessary for the accomplishment of her goals. Retiring replacement Rachel probably had to be done, but perhaps not so graphically. Why this cruelty? Why the rage? Is it just in her programming, or is there more to her story? There is so much unrecognized and unaddressed potential here that I have to wonder if her cruelty was just written to make the audience dislike her for her final scene, where K  uses his superior force to hold her underwater until she drowns. I feel like there\u2019s a metaphor in there somewhere.-Replacement Replicant Rachel. This one is a doozy. Her character is a shell literally engineered to look and act like another character\u2019s previous love interest. It\u2019s messed up, and luckily in this case it\u2019a clear that the writers wanted you to think it\u2019s messed up. I think she has one line, and it\u2019s something like \u201cDon\u2019t you love me?\u201d She is then discarded and slaughtered graphically by Luv.-Dr. Stelline, a memory maker who has been illegally inserting real memories of her life into the minds of replicants. She has spunk! She\u2019s an independent contractor instead of an employee! She\u2019s smart! She\u2019s a true artist! She\u2019s also lonely, and misses human interaction. I give the filmmakers an A+ for creating a female character with at least some nuance, even with such a short screen time. -Freysa is an escaped replicant now running an underground resistance/rebellion. She is missing an eye and wants reproductive justice. She has an army, but would prefer to send a brand new stranger on a mission to save her skin/revolution than have one of her soldiers do it. Questionable decision, but she seems pretty cool, and she doesn\u2019t die brutally, or get raped, so that\u2019s cool. -Depictions of women can be seen throughout the film, usually in the context of sex. Glowing holographic advertisements for companionship line the city skyline. Collapsed sculptures of sensuous women line the abandoned streets of Las Vegas. No men are advertised, and no male figures seen among the sculptures.Of note: I don\u2019t believe this film passes the Bechdel test.

The scenery, the score, the constant questioning of what it means to be human, all struck cords in me. In these respects, it perfectly captured what I loved from the original film. It was everything I wanted and more. But after seeing it, I was struck by one negative holdover from the original: at least one of the writers has a serious problem with women. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I remember that the original film showcased women as little more than sex objects (or as violent mindless killing sex objects). However, this is 2049, haven\u2019t there been any advances here? The answer is no. If you haven\u2019t seen it and plan to, stop reading here. Beyond here there be spoilers. The women are as follows:-A drunken sex-starved and intellectually compromised policewoman, who tries to seduce(?) her replicant charge, and lets him escape police custody when he has proven to be mentally unstable, because she likes him/lets emotions rule her actions at work. (Ya know, like women do.) She is later violently killed, and there\u2019s a great scene where her body is manhandled and carelessly used by her killer. I originally found that scene amusing, but in the greater context of the treatment of women in the film, somewhat disturbing. -Rachel the replicant (remember her, from the original movie?) apparently died in childbirth some years ago. As always, a classic trope. I mean, in this world robots are seen doing autonomous surgeries (now that I think of it they may have been autopsies), so while we aren\u2019t surprised by the apparent lack of progress in maternal-fetal medicine and childbirth safety, perhaps we should be. -A nameless female replicant who is alive for only a few minutes when her creator violently cuts open her womb with a scalpel he just happened to have on hand. This is probably the biggest gratuitous violence against women scene in the movie. Other people are injured or killed, but this is the one that simply makes the least sense. There was no reason for it. Perhaps it would be seen as an inappropriate act of misplaced anger or frustration, except that it was apparently premeditated (given the ready scalpel). The act is committed by a man in a serious power position, and is witnessed by his female replicant slave/worker. She looks on at the scene, shivering slightly, perhaps like any woman would in the presence of a violent abuser.

Sometimes she is a 1950\u2019s housewife, sometimes more of a manic pixie dream girl. This character actually goes so far as to buy another woman\u2019s time for in-the-flesh sex. (An amazing scene, by the way, I was riveted.) She is remarkably curt to the woman she hired, which makes sense as she is literally just a computer program that exists to serve her owner, and likely has no space in her programming for politeness or general decency for other people. -Oh, that in-the-flesh sex worker? She is just using the Blade Runner! That\u2019s right, a woman using sex to manipulate her partner! Does she have a name? I can\u2019t remember. It wasn\u2019t important. At least she doesn\u2019t get brutally murdered. In fact, she\u2019s apparently part of a secret underground army! Cool! What part does she play? What\u2019s her backstory? Is she really just personally interested in having replicant babies? Who knows. Her character isn\u2019t developed other than what is directly needed for the plot.-Luv, the replicant assistant. She has a name, so we know she\u2019s important. She is bad with people, unusual for a female character. But she likes to kick ass and wants to be \u201cthe best\u201d, so at least we have that going for us. She pretends to be a harmless and servile replicant, and honestly she isn\u2019t great at pretending. She has some anger and competition problems, and seemingly enjoys killing others. We see her crush a man\u2019s spine, kill the policewoman, casually launch rockets at a half dozen people, and later shoot another woman in the head. She also has a pretty great fight scene with the Blade Runner where she uses some sharp curvy knives reminiscent of that adamantium fingernail lady in the X Men movies. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this woman fights like a badass. But she also has more human flaws. It\u2019s difficult to say exactly what emotions drive her. Jealousy? Anger? A need to impress her boss? Personal drive to overcome perceived injustice of replicant subservience? (Or perhaps female subservience? That last one is my guess, anyway.) Either way, she shows apparent cruelty more than once, in her speech while killing the police woman, when she crushes the hard drive containing hologram  girl, and when she shoots replacement Rachel replicant in front of Deckard. At least in the first two cases, these actions are unnecessary for the accomplishment of her goals. Retiring replacement Rachel probably had to be done, but perhaps not so graphically. Why this cruelty? Why the rage? Is it just in her programming, or is there more to her story? There is so much unrecognized and unaddressed potential here that I have to wonder if her cruelty was just written to make the audience dislike her for her final scene, where K  uses his superior force to hold her underwater until she drowns. I feel like there\u2019s a metaphor in there somewhere.-Replacement Replicant Rachel. This one is a doozy. Her character is a shell literally engineered to look and act like another character\u2019s previous love interest. It\u2019s messed up, and luckily in this case it\u2019a clear that the writers wanted you to think it\u2019s messed up. I think she has one line, and it\u2019s something like \u201cDon\u2019t you love me?\u201d She is then discarded and slaughtered graphically by Luv.-Dr. Stelline, a memory maker who has been illegally inserting real memories of her life into the minds of replicants. She has spunk! She\u2019s an independent contractor instead of an employee! She\u2019s smart! She\u2019s a true artist! She\u2019s also lonely, and misses human interaction. I give the filmmakers an A+ for creating a female character with at least some nuance, even with such a short screen time. -Freysa is an escaped replicant now running an underground resistance/rebellion. She is missing an eye and wants reproductive justice. She has an army, but would prefer to send a brand new stranger on a mission to save her skin/revolution than have one of her soldiers do it. Questionable decision, but she seems pretty cool, and she doesn\u2019t die brutally, or get raped, so that\u2019s cool. -Depictions of women can be seen throughout the film, usually in the context of sex. Glowing holographic advertisements for companionship line the city skyline. Collapsed sculptures of sensuous women line the abandoned streets of Las Vegas. No men are advertised, and no male figures seen among the sculptures.Of note: I don\u2019t believe this film passes the Bechdel test. If I remember correctly, when in the same area, the female characters are always talking about a man when they talk to each other.Am I reading into it too much?

Is one of the nicest most upstanding guys I've ever met.Mark aka DH - my husband Other Mark - My twin sister's boyfriend Anna aka twin - My twin sisterJared, DH, twin, and myself all grew up and went to high school together. Other Mark and Anna have been dating for about 8 years but Other Mark grew up in a  different state.Jared is walking in a charity walk and needs to raise a certain $ amount to \"officially\" walk, or qualify, or something... not entirely sure how it works - all I know is he's done it for the past 6 years and always gets super into it and is passionate about it. It's something that hit close to home for him. Whatever. So the deadline to raise the $ is this weekend. My husband thinks his posts about it are annoying and he's donated in the past but doesn't like the callouts on social media so he stubbornly refused to donate this year. Jared sent out a call to action email yesterday to get the last of what he needed. I was chatting with him over text, found out how much he needed (about $400), got his participant id, yada yada, all the other formalities about how we're all doing and his new girlfriend and buying a house etc. I donated the money and had my company match and so now he's met his goal.Of course in true Jared fashion, he posts a Facebook post thanking all the donors who pushed him over his goal. Not only did he tag Mark, but he tagged Mark in front of me. I saw it and laughed because that's exactly why Mark didn't donate in the first place. Plus the donation was entirely in my name (and entirely my $). The more I've thought about it, the more annoyed I've became.I vented to my twin sister, Anna, and she laughed and pointed out Jared didn't assume she was donating when Other Mark donated (in other words, he tagged Other Mark, but not Anna).So. On one hand, I know Jared didn't mean anything by it. Mark and I are happily married, we're a team, Mark is one of Jared's best friends. But on the other hand, I'm a strong independent woman, dammit, and that was all my money. In a world where I'm very often put second to my very DH, sometimes it would be nice to just be acknowledged for myself. Not sure if this is a hill I'm willing to die on, but wondering if there's a graceful way to acknowledge it and move on in the interest of fighting the good fight.TL;DR: I donated a bunch of money to a lifelong friend's fundraiser and he included my husband in his thanks even though DH didn't donate a penny. Wondering what to do next, if anything.Edit for formattingUPDATE:You guys \ud83d\ude02 Without even prompting, my husband humorously shut it down in the comments of the Facebook post: \"FYI, pretty anti-feminist and gender-conforming traditionalist that I had something to do with this ;).
