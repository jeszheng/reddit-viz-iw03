Sessions said no because a foreign policy advisor named Papa had proposed getting people who would contact the Russian government and Sessions shot it down.

Trump\u2019s closest aide for the first few months of his presidency, Steve Bannon, had previously run Breitbart,\u00a0which regularly trafficked in racist and anti-Semitic tropes and even had a news section titled \u201cBlack Crime.\u201d>Now Trump employs a chief of staff who believes the failure to \u201ccompromise\u201d over the enslavement of black people is what caused the Civil War, rather than the refusal of some Americans to compromise over the actual enslavement of black people.>At a time when America is increasingly becoming a multicultural society, with whites making up 60 percent of all Americans, compared to 85 percent\u00a0in the mid-1960s, we have a president who not only continues to govern almost exclusively for white America, but who also regularly disrespects and belittles the dignity of minority Americans. I can\u2019t even imagine what it must be like to be a black person witnessing the White House chief of staff praising a Confederate general, but yet here we are.>I try to be an optimist when it comes to politics. I still think the arc of history bends toward justice \u2013 though my confidence has been severely tested over the past two years. One wants \u2014 almost needs \u2014 to believe that the better angels of our nature will prevail. But in the way that racists like Jeff Sessions, Stephen Miller, and, yes, John Kelly, have embraced Trump\u2019s wretched political agenda is an unfortunate reminder that the forces of darkness will not give up without a fight.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 193570, "comment_id": "dp6l5ys", "score": 101, "submission_time": "Wed Nov  1 10:47:48 2017", "ups": 101}, {"body": "It's a bit unfair to let them off the hook with the fairly generic label racist.

Maybe consider linking a [Breitbart article about how muslim gangs are raping young girls](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/10/25/another-rotherham-grooming-gang-court-raping-young-girls/).Use divisive language in your ads, but nothing that directly calls anyone out so the ad can get approved, something like:*Texans! Keep your loved ones SAFE from terrorism!*Use pictures that invoke the \"gotta protect OUR children\" reaction. [Something like a young white girl in a white dress holding a teddy bear?](https://st3.depositphotos.com/9880800/16166/i/1600/depositphotos_161662920-stock-photo-mother-and-daughter-with-teddy.jpg)Set your budget--$5 a day is a pretty good place to start to figure out your cheapest cost per click--and run that bad boy. You can get as low as 9 cents a click if your audience interact well to the ad (i.e. they click it, they LIKE it, they comment on it), so don't worry, those $5 will go a LONG way. Once you get a good audience, you turn up the budget to as high as you want to reach as many people as you can.Facebook will deliver this ad to your aforementioned audience's newsfeed *because those people have proved to FB that they are more likely to engage with this sort of content*. Ideally, you want to keep this going on for about six months to a year to ensure that you build a big enough audience group who will not only click on your link but who will also LIKE and FOLLOW your page.  After that is where the fun begins. This is when you create an event called \"Keep Islam out of Texas\" from that page.Remember that audience you've been cultivating all these months? You can save it, expand it, and create what FB calls a lookalike audience--i.e. people who 'look' similar to your audience in their online behavior or could *otherwise be brought into that audience*.You can use that to target up to 5% of the entire US population. Yeah, let that number sink in. Do the same kind of ads, but this time drive people to this event. Since they've been blasted by your content for the past half to whole year, it should be a pretty easy sell.

It was to re-train miners on how to install solar panels or do other jobs since solar installation is bigger in the west.  The program included free education, transportation to the school, certification fees, child care services, job finding services, and much more.

Obama also authorized a study on what it would take to help unemployed coal workers get back on their feet in 2009 in response to the surge in gas/oil through modern fracking techniques.  In addition to this, Obama wanted to invest 1 billion dollars into cleaning up all of the abandoned mines and building industrial parks.

It's innocent until proven guilty. We should not just be throwing out names and demanding people's heads based on allegations. Bring me a case with some evidence and let's nail the fuckers to the wall, by all means. Otherwise we can just ruin anybody for any reason.EDIT Below----------------And my point is proven below in the comments by a particular commenter (most comments are good discussion). This person is accusing me of having a guilty conscience because I have sexually assaulted somebody in the past. *It sounds like you've got a guilty conscience and are worried about some girl's ass YOU grabbed in the past. You have 0 sympathy from me, dude. Fuck all of you and your entitlement to women's bodies. I hope you are all called out. No, your life won't be ruined. Yes, if you are even marginally a decent human being, you will be ashamed and embarrassed--as you should have been when you did the deed.*So to drive my point home even further, it's story time. I'll try to paraphrase. NYE 2009, my then girlfriend's roommate comes home at like 3 am barely able to walk. I had to carry her into the house. She was followed in by 4 dudes, who I immediately tried to tell to leave. They forced their way in. Roommate starts sobbing on the floor saying she doesn't know who they are, she can't even hold her head up. I carry the roommate upstairs and lock her and my girlfriend in the room and tell her to call the cops. I try to convince the guys to leave, even hand them 50 bucks for cab fare. But they are ready to \"run train on these bitches.\" They decide they outnumber me and start to push me around. I tell them the cops are already on the way, and thier response was to smash me in the face with a glass. A brawl ensues where I get the shit kicked out of me. I almost lost my left eye, if I hadn't had my glasses on at the time, I would have. 19 stitches in the face, two busted teeth, and a bone contusion to the ribs and some stolen property is the price I paid for them leave. I had nightmares for months, had to go through a few different surgeries due to a subdermal hematoma and scar reductions.https://imgur.com/a/axQGMAnd I'd do it again in a heartbeat.So, don't you dare come at me and accuse me of not respecting women and being a scumbag that does shit like the dudes from my story did. I've (likely) put FAR more on the line than you ever did /u/glitter-and-paste when it comes to protecting women from the scumbags of the world. I sincerely hope you learned something today.

Just like Christians are not all bad, but there are bad Christians. That being said, much like how most of the Christians you meet that are alright aren't very devout, I'm betting that most of the nice Muslims you meet aren't very devout. All holy books have garbage in them that is holdover from times when the societies that created them were ignorant and less tolerant of others around them. The bible contains passages where adherents are told to kill people for wearing certain types of clothing, but most Christian societies don't follow that one because they think it's stupid. Likewise, Islam has laws in the Quran that tell its adherents to kill for equally stupid reasons. The difference is that there are still huge numbers of Muslims who don't think those parts of the Quran are stupid. They have whole governments and well-funded organizations that teach people that those parts are just as important as the good parts of the Quran.Quite frankly, I think that the Right's condemnation of Islam and Muslims is wrong, BUT I think that the Left's blind defense of Islam is equally wrong. I hear plenty of Left-wingers harping on about how terrible the Crusades were, and I have yet to hear one of them shut up when you tell them that most Christians didn't participate in them and that Christianity is a mostly peaceful religion. The fact is, Islam's core tenants are not inherently bad; just like how Christianity's core tenants are not bad. But both religions have shit in there too, and Islam is the only one of those two where are significant number of adherents actually PRACTICE that bad shit. Asshole Christian lawmakers may pass laws making it illegal for gays to get married, but asshole Muslim lawmakers pass laws to KILL gay people. People need to stop turning a blind eye to the bad shit in Islam because they (mistakenly) believe they are defending an oppressed minority group.That all being said, I am absolutely NOT in favor of blanket condemnation of Muslims or Islam as a whole. BUT, we do need to acknowledge that there's room for some improvement there. To that end, people need to be more supportive of efforts to actually reform the religion and to ACKNOWLEDGE when those reforms occur. Liberals need to stop pretending Islam is fine as-is and that the idea of separating church and state is only meaningful when talking about Christianity. At the same time, Conservatives need to stop acting like Islam is just one big shit-show and that anyone who follows any of it is some kind of psychopath and that the religion needs to be eradicated.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 8097, "comment_id": "dp6qi2x", "score": 3, "submission_time": "Wed Nov  1 14:00:04 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "just another crazy alt-right male.  there's a pattern.ITT:  trumpers crying about liberals.  wtf?

Let me preface this by saying that I'm not religious or anything close to it, but I am the son of a recovering addict who's spent the past 6 years building a Celebrate Recovery branch (a Christian org) and helping people improve themselves. First of all the faith part to begin with. An important part of recovery is losing the me-centric idea. If you've ever been close to someone with an addiction that has begun to effect their relationships then you know that they often see everything that goes wrong as a slight against them and what goes right is because of them. There are a lot of ways to overcome that, one of them is to say \"I'm not the most important thing, God is\" then you're taking steps in the right direction. It also has other roles. In many ways, along with your actual sponsor people can find strength confiding in God. This is really important for people cause when in recovery people tend to focus on what they've done to others and want to make amends. It's a good thing, but people have to work on themselves for those amends to mean anything, the idea of a greater power helps out with that. And as much as I would love to see the government put money into mental health and recovery they just aren't. Private recovery programs are expensive and have many of their own flaws. So what's the best way for the system to deal with addicts? Send them to programs as a part of their parole. It's far better than wasting everybody's time and money with jail, and gueess what, most of these organizations have some basis in faith (AS, NA, Etc.) and they should be used.In the end these faith based recovery programs have the goal of helping people, not telling them that if their faith isn't strong enough they won't make it. And because of that they are usually more than willing to accept the ideas of secular programs, just adding faith as one of the basis'What these groups did is unacceptable, but there are far more faith based recovery groups that arre trying to help people overcome one of life's hardest possible personal problems.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 21094, "comment_id": "dp6xjnn", "score": -3, "submission_time": "Wed Nov  1 16:22:49 2017", "ups": -3}, {"body": "Let's cut the shit and just bring back slavery.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 62670, "comment_id": "dp75ke0", "score": -5, "submission_time": "Wed Nov  1 18:36:05 2017", "ups": -5}, {"body": "Quick research indicates that the federal 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which I believe has jurisdiction over Arkansas, has ruled that a court cannot order someone to attend AA, which is merely theistic (though many members are atheists or agnostics, using something other than God as their \"Higher Power\").

Tough on crime bills almost always get passed, no matter if they go too far or don't even make sense. This is the problem with \"Special Interest\" money and why we need campaign finance reform laws to keep dirty money out of politics.

That's because no one has sympathy for them whatsoever, and any time they try to speak up about injustices they have suffered usually the judge and/or local officials writes off their complaints as \"typical junkie behavior\".

Please see the UK Epilepsy Society's excellent reference page [here](https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/first-aid#.WGVhilMrLRY) for additional information**&nbsp;First Aid for someone having an Epileptic Seizure:* Stay calm.* Look around - is the person in a dangerous place?  If not, don't move them. Move objects like furniture away from them.* Note the time the seizure starts.* Stay with them. If they don't collapse but seem blank or confused, gently guide them away from any danger. Speak quietly and calmly.* Cushion their head with something soft if they have collapsed to the ground.* Don't hold them down.* Don't put anything in their mouth.* Check the time again. If a convulsive (shaking) seizure doesn't stop after 5 minutes, call for an ambulance (dial 911/999 or your country's emergency services number).* After the seizure has stopped, [put them into the recovery position](https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/step-step-recovery-position#.WGViIVMrLRY) and check that their breathing is returning to normal.  Gently check their mouth to see that nothing is blocking their airway such as food or false teeth. If their breathing sounds difficult after the seizure has stopped, call for an ambulance.* Stay with them until they are fully recovered.[-Source](https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/10-first-aid-steps-for-convulsive-seizures#.WGVhPlMrLRY)Some forms of seizures may need additional assistance. Please see [here](https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/first-aid-all-seizures#.WGVhQFMrLRY) for seizure specific tips. Also be aware of a condition called [\"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy\"](http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/impact/mortality/sudep) (SUDEP). The causes of SUDEP are unknown, and strike 1 in 1,000 individuals with epilepsy, or 1 in 150 if the epilepsy is uncontrolled. Keep this in mind as you are providing first aid for a person having a seizure.&nbsp;Individuals who have epileptic seizures are also prone to a postictal phase. This is an altered state of consciousness after an epileptic seizure. It usually lasts between 5 and 30 minutes, but sometimes longer in the case of larger or more severe seizures, and is characterized by drowsiness, confusion, nausea, hypertension, headache or migraine, and other disorienting symptoms. [- Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postictal_state)&nbsp;When a person with epilepsy is in this state, you can best assist them by helping to reduce loud noises, prevent people from touching them, and generally providing assistance as requested. Individuals in a postictal state can be prone to lashing out in a startled, or angered state, but be aware it is not intentional.They will appreciate your calm assistance once they recover.&nbsp;----------------------------------------------^(I am not a bot.
