I explained about the bars for sale.  She told me, \"Oh look how cute you are!  Listen, if you come inside, I'll give you an extra special treat for your team.\"  I was so excited that I went inside thinking it would be a big help to my team.  Once inside, she started caressing my back and telling me how handsome  I was.  When she pulled my shirt off, I completely froze in the moment and couldn't do anything.  She took this as a good sign.When she got me naked on the bed and started stimulating me, I could only think \"Oh, god, it's happening again\" and went out of my head disassociating.

I was suicidal and had just switched medications. My parents were going out of town for the weekend and decide to leave me at home, I begged to go or have them stay and told them that i didn't feel safe being alone but they left anyways. Because of my depression I had lost a lot of friends and no one wanted to come over to stay with me. I went on world of warcraft and was venting about it to some guild mates and my good WoW friend. My wow friend was 24 at the time and he offered to come stay with me if i was to scared to be alone. I felt weird about it but I really couldn't be alone and I thought I could trust him so I said yes. On the way there I really really really wanted to say no don't come but I was worried about offending him. He got to my house, I let him in and we talked and watched a movie. Things were good. Then we went to Mimis Cafe for dinner to get our food to go. When we got back to my house he got me a soda. This is where he slipped the drug into my drink. I suddenly was extremely tired, I couldn't walk or move. He picked me up and put me in bed. I don't remember anything else. I woke up the next morning and my shirt and pants were off and I had blood in between my thighs. My nipples were also bleeding because he had bitten them. He was cuddling me and when I came to he gave me a kiss and said last night was so fun I love you. I was shocked and confused. I also was at a point in my life where I could not mentally handle being raped and losing a friend on top of that. My brain kind of made up a situation where this was all okay and I had wanted it. I gave him a kiss, made him breakfast and finally got him out of my house. My parents got home later that evening. My mom got a call from one of our neighbors saying that there had been a man at our house the night before. My parents asked me about it and I said it was my friends brother. They called my friend who's parents said no one had been over. My parents lost it and I told them the truth. My mom had my dad drop me off at a youth homeless shelter because she would not have a slut living in her house and within six months I was in foster care.

He was someone I had known for a while, an ex of a friend as well as a classmate in my major. We spent a lot of time together that semester- studying, working in the lab together and going out to meet other friends afterwards. One night we met at a bar around happy hour to run through flashcards and then some friends were supposed to meet us, but never did. I ended up giving him a ride home around 9:30. He invited me in to have a beer and check out his progress on his thesis work (we were art students, so it was a physical piece in his room). Once we walked into his room, he shut the door quickly \"so we wouldn't wake up his roommate\". He started trying to kiss me and I immediately said no way man. He kept gently pulling me towards the bed saying things to try to convince me to stay. I was not having it, and once I really put my foot down and said fuck you I'm leaving he grabbed me aggressively and threw me on the bed. At one point my head banged into his nightstand and I got really fuzzy. I fought him back the whole time, but he was much stronger than me and managed to assault me. I think he may have scratched or bit my neck, because I have a slight scar there from that night. The fucking scumbag also texted me after I left saying \"Was this your first time almost being raped?\" I responded, \"No you asshole, it wasn't, and you DID rape me.\" He approached me in the lab on Monday and cornered me saying he hoped we could still be friends. I ended up failing all three classes we had together and not getting my degree. The happy ending is that I reached out to the head of my program a few years later and told her everything. She worked with my department chair to get my Fs turned into medical withdrawls and waived the course requirement for the one credit I was missing, so I got my degree! The really fucked up thing about this was, I had no reason to ever suspect him. We had spent so much time together, and I had been in his house countless times. I'd crashed on the couch when I was too drunk to drive, I had been alone with him before. I don't know what made this one night different.

None of us drank in high school, so we were laughing at ourselves while exchanging college drinking stories. I told one of mine, and for whatever reason the brother didn't believe me (the story was nothing special) and got really mad about it.

I start asking and then pleading for their help, but they just watch and laugh as he then grabs hold of my crotch, sits for another minute, and finally gets up.

The idea was to see how many people would ignore the request and just go draw on him anyways, that was the way it started anyways.  He was a psych major and was studying something that was pertinent to this...Pretty basic - Tons of dudes would go in there with markers, empty cans, etc, build forts on him as he pretended to snore.  Draw on his face, fart on his face, etc, stick balls on his forehead and snap pics (Instant Polaroids btw - this is way before cell phone cams).But then, it got weird, we actually cancelled the project because so many girls turned out to be rapists.After most people would pass out, my buddy would get lone, and sometimes, 2 or 3 drunk girls coming into his room, they'd always do the same thing:  Walk around the room being really quiet and sneaky, then when they realized he was snoring, start being extra loud and falling all around, my guess was to see HOW asleep he really was, see if they could wake him up to gauge how drunk he was.  Then they'd say something gross, like all of them did this, \"Time for mama to get some!\" or \"Don't worry, I'll do the work stud!\"(that one stuck with me) even one girl who started doing what we now call twerking on him singing \"Suckin that Di&k, ya suckin that Di&k!\" over and over.  Almost all of them were rubbing his crotch or butt while doing these things, and all of them were watching his face while doing so.As soon as they'd try to get his pants off, or go any further than rubbing, he would bolt up and scream \"Get off me!\" as loud as he could, they would bolt and half the time hit the wall on the way out, we got all of this on camera.He did this for like 6 months before we realized that even the good girls were perverts, like, we had girls we would NEVER imagine being rapey coming up there if they noticed everyone else was passed out, literally, valedictorians from their HS's were trying to rape my buddy.One time he actually did fall asleep and a girl whipped his dick out and was singing into it like a microphone when he came to.I basically learned that year that most women are just as rapey as men but they tend to not get caught because they are smarter about their approach.We also did a chris hansen intervention with several of them, way before it was a show, girls we knew, and thought we respected, girls with 4.3 GPA's that went on to be bio chemists and surgeons.They said stuff like \"Girls have hormones too!\" and \"I thought he was inviting me up there by asking me to leave him alone!\" etc...When we would point out that it was rapey, they would cry and say \"I know, I'm fked up, I'm sorry.\"Two of them left Uni, and several begged us not to tell, implying that this was not their first rodeo.Changed my whole perspective on sexual assault, trust me ladies and gents, it's not just the boys, the girls are just as bad, they just don't get caught because they choose guys that are drunk and out cold snoring apparently.  Forgot about reverse rapist girl - she was a TA in a chemistry class I had, she came in, saw he was passed out drunk, laid next to him, started pretend snoring with her eyes open, and would move his body parts onto hers, then lay still and snore, see if he noticed, then move him some more, like, she had him basically on top of her, with one hand between her legs, and one hand on her bared breast, and she started licking his throat, which prompted him to scream \"GET OFF OF ME!\" which was hilarious, because he was on top, didn't stop her from horse kicking him off of her and sprinting headlong into a hallway banister.  She was the first girl we intervened on and she packed up and left that day, never heard from her again, word was she x-ferred to Davis.  But she was an interesting one, she basically set the scene up in a way that it LOOKED to a 3rd party that they both were passed out drunk, so even if someone caught her raping him, she could say \"I was on bottom, how could I have raped him?\" and she would have probably won that argument had it not been for 8MM taping technologies haha!Since I know people will ask, we destroyed all the tapes, and dropped the project.  We both kinda stopped going to parties and we didn't want to ruin anyone's lives, plus, it was sooo many women that half the school would have been arrested for attempted rape and neither of us wanted to be at the heart of that scandal.And these women, turned out fine btw, I know several of them still, we never bring up the attempted rapes, but ya, it happened, and most of them now know that we knew.

He was 8 years my senior but I didn't care, no one had ever paid me any attention so I was happy. I should mention here that he was married. I have no excuse for what happened between us and I still feel horrible about it, but it is what it is. Anyway, we continued with just sex for a few months before I tried to break it off. I felt super guilty for lying to his wife and my family about our relationship so I tried to leave. He wasn't having it. He quilted me into staying, sayi g he would rather die than be without me and he said he'd almost bought weed the night I told him I was leaving. At the time, weed had a really big stigma around it for me, and I was afraid of what it would do to him (hindsight says ha!). I stayed.A few months later, I'd graduated high school and could spend a lot of time with him. I'd go over and we'd have sex and he would berate me and pinch me, leaving bruises on my legs and arms. When his wife would come home, we'd all get along like nothing was happening, but it would go on when she went to bed. He pressured me into sex acts I wasn't comfortable with and he'd hurt me physically. The physical abuse never got above the bruises, but he'd do it whenever he was feeling like I wasn't paying enough attention to him or if he didn't like what I was doing. The year after I graduated, his wife got pregnant. Because I was so close to them, I was designated their baby's hororary aunt. I stuck around because I'd grown to love his wife as a really good friend and I was genuinely excited for their baby. I both naively and terrifingly thought that when the baby came, I'd be free, but also forgotten. Throughout the pregnancy, he continued to pressure me into things. I remember one day, he wanted to give me oral, but I wasn't feeling it. I told him explicitly that I didn't want it, he shot back \"of course you do, you always do\" and was angry when I repeatedly said that I didn't. He stopped talking to me for a little bit and I was so afraid because I didn't want to lose him. I eventually stopped saying I didn't want sexual things from him because it was easier to go along with it than fight with him. Their baby came and I was put on the back burner. I was initially thankful, but after his wife went back to work, I was over there a lot, helping out with the baby and still being his sex toy. As their baby grew, I drifted from him. All my time was spent with their child, feeding and playing and teaching. I didn't knownis love someone so much. The following spring, my grandpa died. His was the first big death in my life and it destroyed me. My family and I went to the state he'd lived in that summer and spent 5 weeks there. While there, my abuser/boyfriend called me non-stop and refused to really let me spend time with my family. He knew that it was the first time I'd seen them in about 4 years, but he didn't care. One of the days he wouldn't let me off the phone, I'd texted him, \"did you call me so much because you miss me? ;)\" He never responded. When I came back home, apparently I'd started treating him badly. I'd known I'd grown distant and that had probably rubbed off but my behavior handy changed. When he confronted me, I made something up about how much it hurt when mybgrandpa died and I didn't want to hurt anyone like that if I'd died. I'm not sure if he believed me or not. The relationship was rocky from then on. I had stopped going over so much, and he'd stopped asking for sex as much. Instead of being his sex toy, I'd turned into his babysitter. I'd watch his kid while he slept or played games with no pay. Because I was Honorary Auntie, and because I love that kid more than anything, I didn't mind, but it still would have been nice for some kind of compensation. After three years since losing my virginity to him, I'd finally had enough when he got very angry with me for saying our relationship wasn't fair. I told him I couldn't do it anymore. I told him I loved him and his kid and his wife, but it wasn't fair to any of us or to any of our families what we were doing. I tried again to cut it off. Again, he wouldn't let me leave. It continued on, worse than before, for another six months before I stopped going over at all unless his wife or other friends were there. Id leave when she went to bed or our friends left. I think he finally got the hint because he let me leave. After three and a half years, I was finally free. Over a year later, I'm still Honorary Auntie, but living in a different city and I have a totally new group of friends. I've entered into a new relationship and I'm starting to be happy again. I've learned that no matter how much you love someone and no matter much that person claims to love you, it's not enough. I've learned that having secret relationships is something I never want again. I've learned that what I did, while wrong and absolutely disgusting, is something that I tried so hard to be rid of for so long. I know that it's not all his fault, I made some big mistakes, too. And I still have a lot to learn. My new relationship has reawakened those feelings of \"don't do anything wrong and he won't leave.\" It's triggered my anxiety over relationships and sex. It's a monsternim going to have to fight even harder to overcome. But I'm learning.

I didn't realize what he was doing until the first time I saw people grinding on the dance floor when I was 16. He used to stare at me while humping things. I don't know when he first started this, but I was in kindergarten when he got fired.* When I was 12, I helped translate for 2 tourists. They followed me everywhere and kept trying to get me go off with them. * The first time I went to Monster Massive I had to keep pushing away hands creeping up my skirt. Learnt that this frequently happened in clubs, so I stopped wearing skirts when I went out and stuck to gay clubs most of the time.* When I was job hunting, a guy grabbed my boobs in public at a networking event. He was married and his  youngest child is 3 years older than me (he mentioned that).* I\u2019ve had my drink spiked. Luckily I was drinking slowly enough to notice something was off (my first drink of the night, noticed things went funky about 1/3 of the drink in), and managed to hide in the bathroom until my friend got to me. This is why I always tell women to ALWAYS find the bathroom in every club and make sure they can make their way there even if they're barely conscious. Lock yourself up in a stall if you can. If you pass out there, at least people won't let some random dude take you home. * I\u2019ve been kissed without my consent too many times. * I\u2019ve had a guy who took off his condom mid-sex and wouldn\u2019t stop even though I said no. Being in a conservative country, I know nothing would happen to him and everyone will be calling me a slut who deserves to get gangraped, so I\u2019ve only shared this story on Reddit. * I had a boss who would keep finding excuses to touch me and will insist I go for dinner with him and keep forcing me to drink. Once, I eventually got tipsy and shoved his hands off me. Afterwards, he claimed that my biggest client complained about me and requested a different Relationship Manager. I called up the client to ask what I could have done to improve, and they were equally confused but they were happy to get a more senior guy so they weren't going to fight for me. My career was nearly over if it weren't for another Unit Head who guessed correctly what the issue was and got me transferred to his team. * I had another boss who would send me inappropriate texts and ask me to go to his hotel room. The first thing he said to me when I met him was, \"Wow, young lady. You're my daughter's age!\" So yes, I noticed he was overly friendly, but I assumed it was cultural differences and he was just being paternal. Nope. People used the fact that I was ok with him calling me things like \"sweet young thing\", \"pretty girl\", \"gorgeous babe\", etc. in public as evidence that I was asking for it. Well, there were many cases within the bank where girls who complain over those kinds of comments get branded as \"too sensitive\" over \"compliments\" and have their careers shot. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. I sent the text messages to HR and nothing happened. It did get forwarded all over the place and my friends from different banks told me they saw it. I'm pretty sure I can't work in finance in my country anymore. Interviews will go well all the way to the Department Head level, then go radio silent when HR does the background check.

Normally, I try to stay sober enough to get myself home and back into my bed but it wasn\u2019t happening that night.One of the people I was with was a girl that had a crush on me for a while and her friend. I wasn\u2019t really interested in or attracted to either of them. We had been friends for a while and I trusted them both. I rode back to their place and a friend brought my car over.

I was afraid of what she would do if I tried to stop her, I was afraid of what she would say to our mutual friends. I was terrified and so I just took it and silently begged for it to end.I never told anyone about that night, I was constantly  questioning the events. Did I do something to make her think I wanted that? If I accused her of what I felt it was, what kinds of consequences would both of us face?

We say that the derivative itself is an operator, which is a fancy for for a function that inputs functions and outputs functions, and denote it as \"D\", so D(f) is the derivative of f(x).  In this way, the second derivative is D^(2)(f)=D(D(f)). The third derivative is D^(3)(f)=D(D(D(f))). And so on.A Fractional Derivative is then an operator H, that takes in functions and outputs functions, so that H^(2)(f)=D(f), where H^(2)(f)=H(H(f)). In general, an A/B-th derivative operator is an operator D*_A/B_* so that D*_A/B_*^(B)(f) = D^(A)(f). You might then be able to extend it to irrational numbers via limits. There are a few different ways to construct these fractional operators: 1.) You can use Laplace Transforms. A [Laplace Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform) is a special kind of operator, and its most useful property is that it turns differentiation into multiplication. The Multiplication-by-x operator is a very basic operator that inputs the function f(x) and outputs xf(x). If L is the Laplace transform, then it turns differentiation into this operator. That is L(D(f))=xL(f). So, in Laplace-world, multiplication by x is the same thing as differentiation. Pretty cool (and useful). In general, multiplication by x^(N) in Laplace-world is the same thing as the Nth derivative. So to do derivatives we can just take a function, put it into Laplace-world, multiply it by x, and then send it back to where it came from. This looks like D(f) = L^(-1)(xL(f)). L(f) first sends it to Laplace-world, x just multiplies it by the variable, and then L^(-1) sends it back. Why not try to do this for *any* power of x? If r is any power that we can consider, then we can say that the r-th derivative of f(x) is * D*_r_*(f) = L^(-1)(x^(r)L(f))This is one notion of Fractional Derivatives. It should be noted that the Laplace Transform is kinda like a \"continuous\" version of a Taylor series. We're taking advantage of this to define arbitrary derivatives.  2.) Another way we can do it is through Complex Analysis. Complex Analysis is a magical place where amazing things happen to really nice functions. Particularly, we have the [Cauchy Integral Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_formula). This says that if we integrate f(z)/((2pi\\*i\\*(z-a)) around a circle, that has the point z=a on the inside, on the Complex Plane, then the we get the value f(a). This generalizes a bit. If we look at the value of the same kind of integral but of the function f(z)/((2pi\\*i\\*(z-a)^(n+1)) then we get the value D^(n)(f)(a), the nth derivative of f(z) evaluated at z=a. As above, nothing is stopping us from replacing the n with any arbitrary value. So we can say that the rth derivative D*_r_*(f) evaluated at z=a is the corresponding integral for f(z)/((2pi\\*i\\*(z-a)^(r+1)). It should be noted here that the Cauchy Integral Formula is a way to pick out Taylor coefficients for a differentiable function on the complex plane, and so we're taking advantage of this to define arbitrary derivatives. 3.) You can expand the limit definition of a derivative to get a formula for the nth derivative. This formula is not too messy, and  only involves combinations of the derivative, along with [binomial coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient).

What isn't clear is if it adds to, or plays a role in sleep at all. It is clear from various proofs that energy can't be the primary or even a major factor is *why* organisms sleep (or have sleep-like states). To give some quick ones:  * Hibernating animals wake up intermittently to both sleep and pee.  e.g. squirrels, don't continuously hibernate. They get out of their hibernation a few times and [in those times they spend most of that asleep^1, ^2]( http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/276/2/r522).   * For humans the energy savings of sleeping vs laying awake but resting is the equivalent to a slice of bread (~50 calories). This is hardly worth losing vigilance for 1/3 the day for.   * The correlation of [body mass and sleep amount is weak at best^3]( https://www.dovepress.com/cr_data/article_fulltext/s80000/80731/img/fig3.jpg). Although generally smaller mammals, for example, sleep more than larger mammals, you can't really guess at the amount of sleep an organism has by their size.  e.g. Lions, Platypuses & chipmunks all sleep around the same amount of time^4.  * Almost every organism appears to have a sleep-like state^5. Even single cell organisms. With these organisms it's unclear if \"sleep\" is even happening, but it's doubtful that reduced stimuli responsiveness does much for their energy expenditure.   The third point, though, show that there is a bit of correlation (even if weak), which indicate that perhaps there are some side benefits of energy conservation in sleep.  I've only highlighted some of the key evidences about energy conservation. There are many, and there is wide consensus that energy conservation isn't the point of sleep.  I will say though, that I think we often make a mistake by trying to see a function of sleep as a ubiquitous thing that *must* be the same across all species (but that is just my thinking on this)   -----------------------------    ^1 ^http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/276/2/r522  ^2 ^http://physrev.physiology.org/content/83/4/1153  ^3 ^https://www.dovepress.com/cr_data/article_fulltext/s80000/80731/img/fig3.jpg  ^(from #4)    ^4 ^https://www.dovepress.com/the-influence-of-gravity-on-rem-sleep-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OAAP    ^5 ^(Sleep-like rather than \"sleep\" since we often define sleep as we see it in humans --i.e. laying down, less responsive to stimuli and brain changes-- but in many organisms, we can't see most of these with the exception of stimuli responsiveness.

You get it. There are many victims. Me too. It's true. I too have been a victim. I also chose not to participate in this viral Facebook meme, and for good reason: silent protest. That's right. I don't need your likes or hearts or cries, or even your angry faces. I am a victim, and I would rather keep my story private. Please don't get me wrong. A LOT if good has come out of this. People who have pent up rage have a sudden and somewhat open invitation to purge their experience. GREAT! Some people must still stay silent. There are victims right now who are torn. If they say \"me too,\" too, their partner, ex, stalker, etc. (no, I did not assume the gender of the victim or perpetrator) may see it and retaliate. I fear that these individuals are feeling pressure to be strong. \"If you don't speak up, you are not strong enough. You are weak. You are a part of the problem.\" No they aren't. They are victims. Just like you. Me too.Honestly, I'm torn too. Yes, me too. On one hand, this is wide scale victim shaming. One victim could come out and endure retaliation or worse. On the other, it is a great opportunity for some victims to finally get off their chest what has plagued them and finally, if ever, feel a sense of freedom. The problem is that victims, all of us, only have two hands. On one hand; say something. On the other hand; don't. Make the decision that will keep you safe. Don't feel pressured to say anything that will hurt you. Clearly, there are many victims that are willing to speak up for you. We are with you, and, I dare say we are not in it for the \"likes\" or \"hopes and prayers.\"My hope and prayer for all of you is that you are safe, happy, and know that you have support somewhere.

Today, a guy I'm friends with on facebook posted a status saying that the hashtag has gotten the point across already, so we should instead use his own proposition of a hashtag - #IHave. As in, \"#ihave met a kind gentleman who stood up for me\" or \"#ihave helped a girl out of a sexual predator situation\". This, he says, is meant to illustrate a \"more positive view of the matter\", because \"not everything needs to be negative\". It's been a couple of days, and he is already saying, \"I get the point, but not all men\"? Obviously we've all met nice people. This is nothing special. I don't see how this helps. I commented on his post with the above paragraph, and another man responded to my comment, saying, \"Actually, given the awful messages young boys receive about themselves as an ongoing social rhetoric, I say it needs serious awareness\". That's kinda the point that got to me the most. So this counter-hashtag is a) meant to distract us from the negative in order to congratulate the men who have been our saviours and b) make men feel better about themselves. I do agree that the unique issues men face need serious awareness. But this is not the time nor place. Making a rebuttal against the #metoo posts under the guise of \"being positive\" doesn't sound like support to me... it sounds more like dismissal and not wanting to face the severity of the issues which sparked the #metoo hashtag. It sounds like yet another \"not all men\". In fact, I don't see how it is relevant at all... why must \"I too have been sexually harassed and I stand in solidarity with all those who have\" be immediately met with \"Yeah okay, but some guys are good, like me!!!

So here is my story; I hope this will reach those who need it most:It began with what most would consider innocent comments:I was told he didn\u2019t feel loved when I said I didn\u2019t want to. I was told it was what married couples were supposed to do. I was told how often all his married friends did it.Then it become something more:I was told it was my duty. I was told by his family it was my duty. I was told I had an obligation to give myself to him. I was told my body was not my own. Eventually it escalated:Every night was a fight if I said no. I was pinned to the bed until I screamed when I tried to walk away. I was deprived of sleep until I consented. I blamed myself for everything that happened. I was convinced I was a bad wife for not satisfying him as often as he needed (even though I couldn\u2019t bring myself to want to). I told myself if I just gave him what he wanted more often then he wouldn\u2019t be so pushy. I caved some nights without putting up a fight because I was just too tired, especially right after I had my daughter, and I wanted to get it over with. I became severely depressed. I became severely anxious. I dreaded his presence. I felt like I had no rights when he was around.I finally left because of my daughter; I didn\u2019t want her to grow up in a house where her dad and I were always fighting. I didn\u2019t realize what I had really experienced until after we separated. At that time, he told me that it wasn\u2019t sexual assault because we were married. It wasn\u2019t sexual assault because I said yes. It\u2019s been almost 3 years since I left and my brain is still wired to believe I\u2019m making a big deal out of nothing. I\u2019m still recovering from what happened, and part of that recovery is reminding myself that I deserve(d) SO much more respect than that. This is what sexual coercion looks like and it is a form of sexual assault that not enough people talk about. Marriage does NOT mean you have an obligation to have sex with your spouse. Being in a relationship does NOT equal consent. If you are being guilted, pressured, tricked, threatened, or otherwise forced into saying yes when you really want to say no, then you are NOT fully consenting. Your body is your body and no person should have control over what you do with it except you. If you were/are in a similar situation, I want you to know that there is no valid excuse for what has/is happening to you; this is abuse and it is not your fault. Please consider speaking to someone about what is going on so that they can help get you to a safe place physically and mentally. If you need someone to talk to then I am a listening ear. If you know someone who needs a listening ear then be one for them, please.

Over this past year we have seen it being used to help people find closure, support and a vast amount of awareness. For a lot of people it has been their first opportunity to speak about an event(s) they have been through. For a lot of others, the similarity in incidents has shown that you are not alone in sexual abuse and that it is actually a very commonplace and far reaching problem. Originally intended to be a repository for India, we haverecently opened it up internationally as we have received submissions from abroad \u2013 we are at 125powerful stories now.I am male, and for me and my other male friends, it has been a real eye opener. As guys we tend tolive in a sheltered bubble. Not because we don\u2019t care, but because none of our female friends evermentioned what they were going through and so we just lived happy oblivious alternate realities.Its why I am so glad for the #MeToo campaign because it is bringing to light something that we havebeen actively fighting to do for the past year. I am around for the next few hours and would love toanswer any and all of your questions. If not today then I will get back to as many of you as I can overthe next few days. :)Help us normalise talking about sexual abuse and bring to light how commonplace and universal aproblem it is.

First time posting on this sub. The #metoo campaign is stirring quite an emotional response. I posted #metoo on my Facebook but I don't feel comfortable going into detail on there. I figured you guys might relate and empathize to my story. Well, and to put it simply, I think it might just be therapeutic to get out--to write the words. During my first semester as a freshman in college, I met Rob. While I wasn't overly attracted to him, he was nice, funny and made me feel wanted. At the time, I felt like this was someone that I needed--someone who would love me as I am. Everyone thought Rob was the nicest guy. My friends, my family, even strangers. He very much thought so himself. He was not a nice guy. It started out slow. At first it was him kissing and touching me inappropriately in public. I expressed to him that the PDA made me uncomfortable. Yet, he did it anyway. He said he had a cute girlfriend and couldn't help it. One evening, a few friends came over to his place to visit. He thought it would be funny to hold me down and take off my clothes in front of them, while they watched in shocked horror. My pleas for him to stop, the tears in my eyes, didn't seem to matter--after all, i was laughing (a defense mechanism of mine) so it was okay. It was just a joke, after all. Then one night we were going to have sex. He wanted to do it without a condom. I wasn't on birth control, so I told him no. Firmly. So, what did he do? He pushed me on the bed, held me down, forced my legs open and did it anyway. He stopped after a few minutes, when I started calling for help from my roommate. My immediate response was \"you raped me.\" His? Apparently you can't rape your girlfriend. Yet, after we broke up, I was the bad guy. This asshole fucker raped me and to this day probably still thinks he's the epitome of morality. Thanks for reading my story. I do apologize if this is triggering to anyone.

Things have gotten out of hand I think and I don\u2019t know what to doc My relationship with my half brother has always been weird. We are very open with each other and nearly nothing has been off limits. We both discuss our sex lives and it has just been natural. As of late though, things have evolved a bit. It all started about 3 months ago when my half brother, let\u2019s call him Justin, accidentally sent me a Snapchat of his dick. He said he meant it for some other girl, I just shrugged it off. I jokingly said \u201cnice\u201d so to not make things awkward. He has seen me at various states of naked by pure accident so I figured it happens. However, things have become a bit more... intense since. His room is right across from mine and two weeks ago I walked out of my room with him on his bed masturbating clearly visible from the hall.I have a boyfriend of three years and he has a girlfriend of almost 5. Not realizing my brother was home and thinking I was home alone I decided to have some pretty loud and obnoxious sex. My boyfriend went home shortly after and I went to shower. When I stepped out of my room I stepped in what I now am pretty sure was a puddle of Justin\u2019s goo outside my door. Then last night i found what has driven me to post this. Which is a pair of my underwear with dried up guy stuff in it in the hallway outside my door. At this point I have no clue what to do.

My friends K and J (they're not anymore for unrelated reasons) had offered to let me stay in their hotel room for free. Offhandedly a few days earlier K had informed me that D was gonna join us. I didn't think anything of it and said it was fine. In the hotel room, we were all drunk and discussing our kinks while playing pinochle. K and I both mentioned rape fantasies, which didn't seem like a big deal to us; we trusted these guys. The night went on, we were all drunk. We all climbed into bed. D started kissing me and although I wasn't attracted to him I rolled with it; kissing is fun and I've never put much stock into who I kissed. He undressed me. I wasn't too comfortable but I still rolled with it. K and J were there, how bad could things get? Then he climbed on top of me. That's when I started resisting and saying no, stop, no. He held me down. I kept saying no, I didn't want to. He said \"you shouldn't've told me about your rape fantasy\". I panicked. I froze. I wanted to scream, to wake up my friends, to kick him in the balls, but my body betrayed me. I couldn't move. I could barely breathe. He penetrated. I shook. I don't know how long it was before he decided to stop - I know he didn't finish. I laid there with his arm around me for what seemed like an eternity before falling asleep. I pushed it out of my mind for the rest of the weekend. I played games, did my volunteer shift, went back to the same bed the next two nights. He brought me a sandwich during my shift. When I got home, I finally started processing everything. I was in a daze. I went to class. My professor asked if I was okay. I was surprised it showed. I lied and said I was fine. I didn't have the words to express what was wrong. I was finally able to open up to my dad about it, which was helpful. I've been in and out of therapy since. I've swung at sexual partners during flashbacks. I've panicked in the store thinking that I saw him. But I'm getting better, slowly but surely.Why don't I post this on Facebook though? I have a limited social group and he's in it. After a year or so of just dealing with him being around I started actively avoiding him. Over the next year I told some of my friends. The female friends, save for two, said that he had either raped them as well or that he'd groped them nonconsensually. The male friends said they weren't surprised, but they were angry. At least once I had to physically stop one from attacking him. But it's those two aforementioned female friends who are the reason I'm not posting this on Facebook. A and R are married and live together. R dated D for several years a while back. I didn't expect much from them but I expected more than I got. After all, R has called me a rape apologist more than once for doubting certain, specific stories. I certainly didn't expect R and A to both say I was lying and to continue inviting D over with me living there. I know I'm not believed, and I know many others in my social group think very highly of D. None of this really has a point, but I've never really shared the story in as much detail as I've wanted to and this seemed a good time and place.

Just like you. Me too.Honestly, I'm torn too. Yes, me too. On one hand, this is wide scale victim shaming. One victim could come out and endure retaliation or worse. On the other, it is a great opportunity for some victims to finally get off their chest what has plagued them and finally, if ever, feel a sense of freedom. The problem is that victims, all of us, only have two hands. On one hand; say something. On the other hand; don't. Make the decision that will keep you safe.

I do realize that it's a little ironic that my post is about speaking up and I seem to only be able to do so under the guise of anonymity, but let's ignore that for now.A few years ago, I went to China to visit a friend I had met in grad school. We spent the first part of the trip in Shanghai, and after eating all of the amazing Chinese food, we went to a massage parlor that her Aunt recommended. I do not want to linger on the negative part of this story, but suffice to say that I was extremely uncomfortable with the \"massage\", but at the same time paralzyed and didn't quite know what to do. Was this normal in China? Am I going to upset him by doing something culturally insensitive? Am I over-reacting? Maybe it's just a language barrier? I didn't do or say anything. I just pretended everything was normal.After we got back to the hotel room I told my friend what had happened. At first, she didn't quite understand what I meant. Of COURSE he was touching me, it was a MASSAGE. After I took some time to explain to her very specifically what happened, her face dropped. She put on her coat, told me to put my shoes back on and follow her. We walked back to the massage parlor about 20 minutes away. She was absolutely fuming the whole walk there while I was still in shock. She asked me if I remembered his name and I did. What happened next was amazing. I stayed outside because I was too nervous, but what I saw I will never forget. Through the window, I saw her march in there, scream his name, and when he approached her, she slapped him. Hard. He started crying and apologizing. He knew what he did and was not denying it. She screamed at him ( I have no idea what she was saying because I don't speak Chinese) until he sulked away.

I was fine with this but after a while he told me to get into the bed with him, bc he thought i was uncomfortable (or so he said) so i did. At the time i was a virgin, i'd had quite a bit of experience with guys, making out, blowjobs, fingering etc, but never actual penetrative sex. (i should note that some of this experience was with his older brother) but i really didn't want or expect anything to happen between us bc we were good friends and he had a girlfriend so i thought nothing of it. I fell asleep, but woke up a little while later to him stroking my hair and kissing me and i froze. Like i didn't know what to do. One thing led to another and initially i resisted by pushing him off me and telling him it wasn't a good idea, but idk, eventually i caved and said okay and basically just completely faked it. I've never really been that attracted to him, i really don't know what came over me, but that's how i lost my virginity..Anyway, I woke up in the morning and went home and cried for a long time, texted my other best friend to tell her i'd made a huge mistake. Next day at school i saw him yelling about it to all our mutual friend. i overheard him saying things about my vagina being too tight, and blaming me for the whole thing.After a while, me and this guy talked about it and agreed it was a mistake and put it behind us.However, a couple of weeks later, things started up again with his brother, who i was really attracted to, and vice versa. We kept the relationship secret from his family, but eventually it led to sex, which to be honest, was great, it felt really good to be wanted and actually enjoy sex in the moment, but after it had happened a couple of times, he started acting a bit weird? Every time we would see each other he would be nice and funny and caring, we would end up having sex and then the morning after he would be really hostile and refuse to talk about what happened. He said it was because he felt guilty for going behind his brothers back. i didn't realise it at the time but i think my constant want for his affection, and then getting consistently rejected in the mornings was kind of damaging. occasionally the sex would be quite rough, and i'd feel very pressured into doing things i wasn't ready to, bc he was so much more experienced than me, and i'd end up faking it again and again and again.i won't go into details but the situation escalated and i've ended up breaking it off with both of them.I don't know why its hitting me now, but as i said, i'm waking up in the night with nightmares about having sex with him (the brother) and the idea of having sex or being intimate with someone like that scares the shit out of me to the point where i'm almost convinced i'll never have sex again.The problem is, i feel like i can't talk to anyone about it and i don't know how to deal with it, because at the end of the day, i consented to all of these sexual encounters, it just doesn't feel like i can truly justify or explain why i'm feeling like this, and even though i feel traumatised, i don't know how to go about working through that trauma.Tl;dr: Had sex with my best friend, even though i wasn't too sure about it, it was awful. tried to get over it by sleeping with his brother, which ended up fucking me up more because he kept rejecting me.

Apologies if this is really long, so **tl;dr: A coworker said something that seemed pretty outrageous at the time, but I'm wondering if I handled it right.**A couple of my coworkers were talking near my desk - not to me, but loud enough that I couldn't focus on my own work - and one of them, Tony, starts bitching about his kids and how expensive they are (he's a single dad). Medical bills, travel, school - you know, stuff that comes with having kids. Out of the blue, he turns around and asks me the title of my post:> How do your parents still love you?Tony knows I still live with my parents. I moved back in with them after college and got a job at this office. I felt like in that moment he was making fun of me for living at home, like he was telling me that he didn't approve of me being a burden to my parents and that he couldn't believe they still loved me. I turned red and almost started to cry because I know my parents have sacrificed so much for me, and I already feel a little guilty, like I'm taking advantage of them. Even though I know this is not true and my parents have never said I'm a burden. It just really hurt to have someone supposedly professional (he's a five-year veteran, I'm just over a year here) tell me that I don't deserve to be loved because I don't live on my own. All because he's inconvenienced by his kids. I wanted to tell him off, but I knew I'd come off badly so I just said> It's probably because I'm such a good child.He laughed it off like it was some big joke, but I just walked away and hid in the bathroom until I thought he was gone. See, Tony has said stuff like this before, like telling me to take a low-paying job and move in with my long-distance boyfriend and \"just get married already.\" (And then complaining to my supervisor that I told him that he needs to pay for the wedding if it's that important to him - fortunately she told him that it really wasn't any of his business and he should think about how stressful the situation is - god bless you, Fiona) I let it go that time, but this time I went into Tony's supervisor's office. I told Carl what happened and how I thought what Tony said was inappropriate and made me uncomfortable. Carl was really supportive and apologetic, even though he had nothing to do with it. He asked me how I wanted the situation handled (I didn't say \"fire him\" even though that's the best-case scenario) and promised to say something casual and small (because the last time Tony said something, he brought it up during a staff retreat and told everyone he was upset that I didn't listen to his advice about my LDR boyfriend).Carl really made me feel like he listened, but now I'm really nervous about tomorrow. I know they didn't have a chance to talk because Carl got swamped with some stuff from the boss, and I am certain that Tony will either be really passive-aggressive or make a big show about apologizing and then just do it again in three months. I almost want to call in sick tomorrow because I feel like I shouldn't have said anything, but I also know that Tony's probably just going to say something again if I don't keep drawing this line. I've told him before that I think it is inappropriate for him to talk about my life outside of work. Did I do the right thing, or could I have handled it better?

The US would be stupid to pay off all their debts, which is why they don't, and China isn't stupid and understands that national debt is good, unlike most of  reddit that think national debt is like personal debt. For all of you NK sympathizers and think they need nuclear weapons to protect them from the US... Check out what NK has done to the US and SK without nuclear weapons.

NK threatening SK and the US has been a staple of their regime since 1970.It's only because of the internet that this has become \"news\" the last 20 years. * NK isn't going to do shit to the US or any of their allies. EVER. They know the US will wipe them out if they even try, and Russia and China know if NK does try that the US will 100% go to war with both of them if that situation ever happened. * NK isn't trying to go nuclear for fear of regime change.Noone in the history of man has any country ever killed more people or been more aggressive to the world's most powerful country, both militarily and economically, than NK has been to the US. Ninja edit: w/o that country continually ignoring them. For decades. As far as global economists are concerned, China's bubble will pop soon. They aren't passing the US, militarily or economicaly. Ever. The US makes as much as their debt yearly. China's debt is 3 times what they make a year. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what's going to happen to China. For those that like to mock the \"misfortunes\" of the US and their debt and think that if China \"cashed in\" to screw the US over... I'm sorry to tell you, it won't ever happen. 76\u2030 of the US debt is owed to US citizens and US businesses. Only a mere 7% is owed to China.  The US owes China 1.3 trillion. The US pulls on almost 20 Trillion a year. It wouldn't be hard or even hurt to pay 1.3 trillion to China, if it came to that.But it won't come to that. The US would be stupid to pay off all their debts, which is why they don't, and China isn't stupid and understands that national debt is good, unlike most of  reddit that think national debt is like personal debt. For all of you NK sympathizers and think they need nuclear weapons to protect them from the US... Check out what NK has done to the US and SK without nuclear weapons.
