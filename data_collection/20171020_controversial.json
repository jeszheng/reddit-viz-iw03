I\u2019m a Gen Xer. That means I grew up playing outside, then was introduced to the Internet where the VAST majority of early users were kids/young adults like me.  There was a relative cohesion to virtual interactions simply because of generational similitudes in tastes and life experiences (except AOL users I guess).  The only exposition we had to bigots and idiots were in family gatherings where Uncle Bob would get into one of his drunken rants about immigrants stealing \u201cour\u201d jobs or other insipid stuff and for most cases  (imo), we\u2019d shut the hell up because we were taught not to start shit with our elders and, to be honest, these types of guys were intimidating in a face-to-face situation.Then came the Mainstream Apocalypse\u2122, where the Internet was used by everyone, gradually mirroring real life in its demographic composition.  The problem with that is that the Uncle Bobs of the world now had a way of annoying EVERYONE. Social media became a family gathering of epic proportions, so millennials were inundated by the negativity of these idiots online.  Put yourselves in their shoes: normal Baby Boomers were too busy with their lives to comment extensively on social media. That left the idiots with more exposure than the average Joe. If there\u2019s an unwritten rule I believe with the bottom of my soul, it\u2019s that the more stupid you are, the more opinions you have. Don\u2019t believe me? Go on Facebook on your local radio station or local news station page and look at the army or cretins misspelling their opinions and bigotry in the comments sections. I swear that 95% of commenters still have to have their goddamn mittens pinned to their winter coats.  So, yeah. Millennials were exposed to these fuckers generalizing (like I\u2019m doing right now myself, ironically enough) their whole generation. Their whole generation who:   \u2022\tWere taught to use the Internet for everything, but were criticized by Uncle Bob for being losers who only spend their times online, watching their phones.  \u2022\tWere taught to not bully anyone and to help each other & fight injustices, but were ridiculed by Uncle Bob for having \u201cparticipation trophies\u201d (handed out by Uncle Bob\u2019s Sister, but let\u2019s not tell them that) and thus being weak-willed or whatever the hell their reasoning is.  \u2022\tWere taught that the planet is going to shit; that they will be alive when the signs will be evident, but are laughed at by the Uncle Bobs for being tree-hugging vegan hipsters.  \u2022\tAnd it goes ON and ON and ON\u2026 Basically everything that is goddamn social progress was laughed at and criticised by the loud minority of the previous generations.  So Millennials grew up in this toxic environment and came of age at a bad economic timing, with less jobs and more debts and other factors that were inexistent or different from previous generations, who smugly accuse them of being lazy bums based on their PAST experience that cannot be applied today.  How the hell would you react to all of that? I\u2019d be pissed, that\u2019s for sure. And I\u2019d complain because (and this will blow your mind I\u2019m sure) I\u2019d actually have SOMETHING to complain about.  Oh, and the Internet? Well, that changed some stuff, too! The news? Back then, they had a few big cats and could afford to be (relative) \u201cneutral\u201d purveyors of news. Now? They need clicks to get money. They need their headlines to be out-of-this-world, outraging, \u201cwtf?!\u201d, etc.  And how do you do that?, by pushing narratives that will shock people. Even though we live in the more crime-free era of Western history, we are inundated with stories of crimes and atrocities, making the world a scarier place than it actually is, and because of that, we need culprits. Guess who Uncle Bob selects and screams about it everywhere?  And guess what? My suburban ass never knew the extent of, say, institutional racism because I was simply not exposed to that growing up in a town that was 99% white. Millennials? They don\u2019t live in small bubbles like the previous generations did; they live in a global village and are exposed to shitty behaviors against minorities and other such things that are simply\u2026 unjust (remember how they were taught to be intolerant of bullies as kids?).  So I\u2019m gonna stop rambling now. Basically, Millennials do complain a lot and imo, 90% of the time they\u2019re right. The other 10%? The TumblrInAction types? They\u2019re a mixed bag of Uncle Aydens and kids spewing stupid stuff online during their blunder years.

He may have meant you and me, but in reality it was the Legislative branch that was enacting changes and as we all know, they represent us about as well as a potato could.. The drawback is that without proper checks and balances, the often self-interested Legislature goes off on their own and comes up with some monstrosity of a bill with countless provisions, revisions, and pages and pages of shit when they should have done it more simply.Other than that, there were a few naive things that were pretty bad. One example is pulling out of Iraq. We see now, with hindsight, that it was a very bad idea that was poorly executed and further destabilized the area, the exact outcome we were trying to avoid that military and civilian advisors said would have drastic results.

Few Americans realise just how much damage George W. Bush did to America's image abroad.  Almost the entirety of Europe, meant to be America's ally, was deeply concerned and ashamed about the foreign and domestic policy approach America was taking.  Only my country, the UK, really stood by the US during this period, and even then your perception among our public dropped enormously.  I know you like to believe that your some stalwart bastion who doesn't need anyone else just because your the most powerful country on Earth, but having friends really helps your cause and you should value it.  Barack Obama did an enormous amount to rebuild America's image across the globe.  His much more measured approach was warmly received, and the focus on diplomacy over warfare did wonders.  I want you to know that your greatest weapon is not your enormous military, but your words.  Use them kindly. I think Trump will do you more damage than Dubya ever could on the world stage.  US dominance on the world stage has already diminished.  People look to China and Germany for new leadership now.  Be mindful of this.  You won't last forever in your current position.

Unemployment rates? Number of U.S. soldiers deployed in active combat zones? Military casualty rates? Should we look at the national debt? If we try to use those kinds of statistics, how closely do we look at the definitions used? There are several different measures for Unemployment Rates; which one do we use? The definition of \"deportation\" changed, so that people turned away at the border were counted as \"deported\"; does that matter if we're looking at immigration statistics? How much of the events of the first year of a presidency should be credited to that president, versus the policies of their predecessor? Bush II chose to bail out the banks to stabilize the economy; if that worked but took time to work, do we give Obama the credit for it? For that matter, how much credit do we put on the president versus the congress and the supreme court? Sure, gay marriage is the law of the land now, but do we say Obama did that, or the Supreme Court? And \"good\" becomes even more subjective when we look at specific policy questions. Obama didn't put many boots on the ground in Syria, didn't put a lot of American soldiers at risk, but was that 'good' if it meant that Syrians were dying instead?

One of Bush Jr's biggest accomplishments was to exercise more of the Executive Branch's powers (whether you agree with his use of it or not). It made the whole system more balanced where the Legislature had too much control before (imo).Obama reversed a lot of that and kept referring to \"the people\" needing to enact change. He may have meant you and me, but in reality it was the Legislative branch that was enacting changes and as we all know, they represent us about as well as a potato could.. The drawback is that without proper checks and balances, the often self-interested Legislature goes off on their own and comes up with some monstrosity of a bill with countless provisions, revisions, and pages and pages of shit when they should have done it more simply.Other than that, there were a few naive things that were pretty bad. One example is pulling out of Iraq. We see now, with hindsight, that it was a very bad idea that was poorly executed and further destabilized the area, the exact outcome we were trying to avoid that military and civilian advisors said would have drastic results. You can easily argue about how we could have kept the status quo and not go to war, but we've already gone to war and pulled out, so no debate is going to change that.I'd still say he did a fairly good job. For a while there it seemed like the world was drawing closer and a new level of international cooperation and understanding was on the horizon. I think he played a part in that by setting the rhetoric of his campaign and later presidency to foster social change and togetherness. I don't think he played a role in the recent reversal of that trend with things like Brexit, Trump, increased Terror attacks, etc. Unfortunately there seems to be a cycle to the way that things keep happening.

His parents watched from the doorway, waving, and smiling as their son disappeared into this distance. On his way, he meets up with his friends and they all begin talking. He looks over and sees a purple butterfly flying around for a moment, before disappearing behind some bushes. The bell rings and he runs inside.\"How are you Timmy?\" Lucy asks him.\"Good,\" he grins. \"Have you ever seen a Purple Butterfly before?\"\"Don't say that...\" Lucy stares at him in disbelief.\"What's wrong? Why can't I say Purple Butterfly?\" Timmy replies, though his tone is a bit louder in his confusion. The class hears this time.\"Mrs. Smith! Mrs. Smith!\" another classmate yells. \"You won't believe what Timmy said!\"\"Now, now class...calm down,\" Mrs. Smith insists. \"Timmy, what is everyone so upset about? What did you say?\"\"All I said was I saw purple butterflies!\" Timmy exclaims, his face flush with distress.\"Timmy!\" she screams. \"Get to the principals' office right now!\" She stands there, face bright red, pointing at the door. Timmy walks slowly out the door with his head down. He reaches the principal's office and sits down in the waiting area. Another teacher stops by, and Timmy just stares at the floor, embarrassed about how he ended up here.\"Timmy?\" the teacher exclaims in confusion. \"How did you end up down here? You never get in trouble.\"\"I just was talking and mentioned purple butterflies and I...\" Without saying anything the teacher grabs Timmy by the ear and drags him into the principal's office.\"You won't believe what this kid just said!\" the teacher screams before leaving the room and slamming the door.\"What did you say Timmy?\" the principal says in a soft tone.\"I'd rather not say,\" Timmy says, sensing a pattern.\"Nonsense\" the principal replies. \"As long as you are honest I will not punish you any more than I have to. You are safe to tell me the truth.\"Timmy sighs, \"All I said was purple butterflies. I don-\"\"GET OUT!\" the principal yells, pointing at the door. \"Walk home. I'm not even calling your parents! This is such a disgrace! I can't believe you would mention that!\" Timmy begins to cry and runs from the office, leaving the school and begins running home. He runs and runs and runs until he reaches his door. His mother is outside and sees him coming. She bends down and opens her arms. He runs into them.\"What's wrong?\" she asks with so much concern.\"I was at school, and I saw a butterfly, and I told everyone that I saw it...and they all told me it was terrible and I shouldn't say it\" he explains.\"What?\" Timmy's mother says in confusion. \"Why would that matter?\"\"I don't know\" Timmy explains. \"It was a purple butterfly.\"\"Timmy go to your room right now!\" she screams. \"Just wait until your father gets home. I'm calling him right now!\"Timmy waits patiently in his room. His mom is on the phone hysterically crying. \"You won't believe what your son said to me....I don't know what we are going to do...come home right now please!\"Silence fills the air. Timmy lays on his bed staring at the ceiling. Then the garage door opens and he knows that his father his home. He hears the clunking of his father's footsteps on the stairs and begins to feel tense.\"Son, why are you home from school?\" he asks, a soft tone fills the air. Timmy feels a bit calmer.\"I keep telling people what I said, and just telling them gets me in trouble. I don't know what is so bad about it!\" Timmy says with tears filling his eyes.\"What did you say?\" Timmy's dad asks.\"I don't want to say.\"\"You can tell me, not punishment for telling me.\"\"That I saw a purple butterfly.\"His fathers face goes red, and a scowl comes across his face. He grabs a backpack and puts a handful of clothes in it.\"You're gone,\" his father screams. \"We can't have you living here anymore.\"Timmy grabs the backpack and starts running again. He decides to go to his grandmother's house because she's always been so good to him. She always made him feel special and had never once got mad at him.After about an hour of walking, he manages to get there. He knocks on the door and tries to fake a smile. He hears the shuffling of her feet and the click of the lock. She opens it and greets him with a hug.\"What are you doing here during school, Timmy?\" she says with a mild look of confusion on her face.\"I just got kicked out of home...\" Timmy says sadly, staring at the floor.\"Well, what did you do?\"\"I just said something I shouldn't have. I don't even know what it means.\"\"What was it, Timmy? You can tell me about it and then we'll get you a cookie. You can stay here until your parents get a bit calmer.\"\"I'd rather not say,\" Timmy says.\"Cookie first then,\" Grandma answers.Timmy takes a bite of his cookie and feels safe. His grandma smiles from across the table.\"Now what was it Timmy?\" she asks.\"I just said I didn't know what purple butterflies were.\"\"OUT!\" she yells.Timmy knew the drill and ran out in tears again.He stumbles around for awhile trying to find a place to sit. He ends up downtown and sees a homeless man. maybe he will tell me! Timmy thinks.\"Can you help me?\" Timmy asks as he approaches the homeless man.\"Sure kid,\" he says in a gruff tone.\"What does purple butterfly mean?\"\"Don't want to ask that kid. Get out of here before I beat your face myself!\"\"Thank you anyways,\" Timmy sighs and walks away.He gets further downtown and sees that the sun is setting. He cries to himself now because the streets are beginning to empty a bit. He watches a police car drive by. Then it drives by again a few minutes later. Then again later, but this time it stops.\"You okay kid?\" the officer says as he approaches.\"I have nowhere to go,\" Timmy says. \"I got kicked out.\"\"Slow down, whats your name?\" the officer asks.\"Timmy.\"\"Now Timmy, what happened? You got kicked out?\"\"Yes sir. I got kicked out of school, my parents, and my grandmas.\"\"Did you do something?\"\"I just said something.\"\"What did you say?\" the cop asks.\"I'd rather not say, it only gets me in trouble.\"\"We will need to know. You won't get in trouble, it will just help our investigation.\"\"I just said I saw a purple butterfly!\" Timmy cries.\"Oh..\" the cop says. He takes out his handcuffs.Timmy begins running. He sees an alleyway on the other side of the street. The officer grabs his arm, but he manages to yank it away. He leaps off the curb and at that moment a truck smashes into him.

His parents watched from the doorway, waving, and smiling as their son disappeared into this distance. On his way, he meets up with his friends and they all begin talking. He looks over and sees a purple butterfly flying around for a moment, before disappearing behind some bushes. The bell rings and he runs inside.\"How are you Timmy?\" Lucy asks him.\"Good,\" he grins. \"Have you ever seen a Purple Butterfly before?\"\"Don't say that...\" Lucy stares at him in disbelief.\"What's wrong? Why can't I say Purple Butterfly?\" Timmy replies, though his tone is a bit louder in his confusion. The class hears this time.\"Mrs. Smith! Mrs. Smith!\" another classmate yells. \"You won't believe what Timmy said!\"\"Now, now class...calm down,\" Mrs. Smith insists. \"Timmy, what is everyone so upset about? What did you say?\"\"All I said was I saw purple butterflies!\" Timmy exclaims, his face flush with distress.\"Timmy!\" she screams. \"Get to the principals' office right now!\" She stands there, face bright red, pointing at the door. Timmy walks slowly out the door with his head down. He reaches the principal's office and sits down in the waiting area. Another teacher stops by, and Timmy just stares at the floor, embarrassed about how he ended up here.\"Timmy?\" the teacher exclaims in confusion. \"How did you end up down here? You never get in trouble.\"\"I just was talking and mentioned purple butterflies and I...\" Without saying anything the teacher grabs Timmy by the ear and drags him into the principal's office.\"You won't believe what this kid just said!\" the teacher screams before leaving the room and slamming the door.\"What did you say Timmy?\" the principal says in a soft tone.\"I'd rather not say,\" Timmy says, sensing a pattern.\"Nonsense\" the principal replies. \"As long as you are honest I will not punish you any more than I have to. You are safe to tell me the truth.\"Timmy sighs, \"All I said was purple butterflies. I don-\"\"GET OUT!\" the principal yells, pointing at the door. \"Walk home. I'm not even calling your parents! This is such a disgrace! I can't believe you would mention that!\" Timmy begins to cry and runs from the office, leaving the school and begins running home. He runs and runs and runs until he reaches his door. His mother is outside and sees him coming. She bends down and opens her arms. He runs into them.\"What's wrong?\" she asks with so much concern.\"I was at school, and I saw a butterfly, and I told everyone that I saw it...and they all told me it was terrible and I shouldn't say it\" he explains.\"What?\" Timmy's mother says in confusion. \"Why would that matter?\"\"I don't know\" Timmy explains. \"It was a purple butterfly.\"\"Timmy go to your room right now!\" she screams. \"Just wait until your father gets home. I'm calling him right now!\"Timmy waits patiently in his room. His mom is on the phone hysterically crying. \"You won't believe what your son said to me....I don't know what we are going to do...come home right now please!\"Silence fills the air. Timmy lays on his bed staring at the ceiling. Then the garage door opens and he knows that his father his home. He hears the clunking of his father's footsteps on the stairs and begins to feel tense.\"Son, why are you home from school?\" he asks, a soft tone fills the air. Timmy feels a bit calmer.\"I keep telling people what I said, and just telling them gets me in trouble. I don't know what is so bad about it!\" Timmy says with tears filling his eyes.\"What did you say?\" Timmy's dad asks.\"I don't want to say.\"\"You can tell me, not punishment for telling me.\"\"That I saw a purple butterfly.\"His fathers face goes red, and a scowl comes across his face. He grabs a backpack and puts a handful of clothes in it.\"You're gone,\" his father screams. \"We can't have you living here anymore.\"Timmy grabs the backpack and starts running again. He decides to go to his grandmother's house because she's always been so good to him. She always made him feel special and had never once got mad at him.After about an hour of walking, he manages to get there. He knocks on the door and tries to fake a smile. He hears the shuffling of her feet and the click of the lock. She opens it and greets him with a hug.\"What are you doing here during school, Timmy?\" she says with a mild look of confusion on her face.\"I just got kicked out of home...\" Timmy says sadly, staring at the floor.\"Well, what did you do?\"\"I just said something I shouldn't have. I don't even know what it means.\"\"What was it, Timmy? You can tell me about it and then we'll get you a cookie. You can stay here until your parents get a bit calmer.\"\"I'd rather not say,\" Timmy says.\"Cookie first then,\" Grandma answers.Timmy takes a bite of his cookie and feels safe. His grandma smiles from across the table.\"Now what was it Timmy?\" she asks.\"I just said I didn't know what purple butterflies were.\"\"OUT!\" she yells.Timmy knew the drill and ran out in tears again.He stumbles around for awhile trying to find a place to sit. He ends up downtown and sees a homeless man. maybe he will tell me! Timmy thinks.\"Can you help me?\" Timmy asks as he approaches the homeless man.\"Sure kid,\" he says in a gruff tone.\"What does purple butterfly mean?\"\"Don't want to ask that kid. Get out of here before I beat your face myself!\"\"Thank you anyways,\" Timmy sighs and walks away.He gets further downtown and sees that the sun is setting. He cries to himself now because the streets are beginning to empty a bit. He watches a police car drive by. Then it drives by again a few minutes later. Then again later, but this time it stops.\"You okay kid?\" the officer says as he approaches.\"I have nowhere to go,\" Timmy says. \"I got kicked out.\"\"Slow down, whats your name?\" the officer asks.\"Timmy.\"\"Now Timmy, what happened? You got kicked out?\"\"Yes sir. I got kicked out of school, my parents, and my grandmas.\"\"Did you do something?\"\"I just said something.\"\"What did you say?\" the cop asks.\"I'd rather not say, it only gets me in trouble.\"\"We will need to know. You won't get in trouble, it will just help our investigation.\"\"I just said I saw a purple butterfly!\" Timmy cries.\"Oh..\" the cop says. He takes out his handcuffs.Timmy begins running. He sees an alleyway on the other side of the street. The officer grabs his arm, but he manages to yank it away. He leaps off the curb and at that moment a truck smashes into him.

But as with society as a whole, sometimes people show those beliefs in public, sometimes they allow them to influence their behavior, sometimes police act *racist*. There is no racist test.

So you have an industry mostly* populated with good, hard working, righteous people who want to do good things in the world, want to make the world a better place by stopping bad shit from happening. And sprinkled among them are hard working people who THINK they are righteous, that see a black person in a bad area and their mind innately believes that his person is up to no good. THAT'S why you have a police culture of circling the wagons. Not because we want to protect dirty cops, but because we know that we aren't bad, and that guy works with me and surely he isn't bad because he wanted to be a part of this good thing doing good work and somebody bad wouldn't be a part of this. Most of the time, we **are** right. The cop(s) being crucified aren't actually racist or bad people. We are in a high stress, high threat environment and we have to make life or death snap decisions day in and day out. Eventually, we are going to make a bad decision. Or we are going to make the right decision and it's going to *look* bad. Or someone is just going to flat out lie about what happened and impugn our character. Occassionally, a racist cop will do a bad thing, and we'll defend it because it's in our nature and training to defend each other. And when it comes out that we were wrong, we end up looking like dicks as a profession. But as to targeted policing because of race?(as a systemic symptom) No. That's a total fabrication and a misunderstanding. The target is not race, the target is income. Police absolutely DO have a moneyist bias. We patrol lower income areas because that's where the open air crime occurs the most. Upper income areas *hide* criminal activity. It happens that a large percentage of the black population lives in these lower income areas (especially around major cities). Now THAT is likely due to systemic racism (but not on the part of police). Banks don't give home loans to minorities. Well paying jobs don't higher minorities. Minorities don't get as many scholarships. Etc, etc. Urban Black people really and truly DO have to play in a rigged system.   Unfortunately this creates anger and resentment. This pushes black youth into criminal lifestyles. And there is an underculture in lower income areas of refuting the governmental system and rules of society that aren't fair to them anyway. Guess who ends up in their neighborhood, on their street, trying to *oppress* their counter-culture lifestyle?

You want an answer? I don't have it. But a better dialogue would be a great first start. When you come to the table with the premise that ALL police are racist, that only pushes one side to leave the room.

In many ways that's true. The standard of living here is such that we don't have to worry about bad water, deadly disease outbreaks, invading armies, famine, large-scale unemployment, low wages, blatant corruption, etc. And yes, it costs a premium to afford all of that, and more so than other places, but you typically can't find all that America has to offer in one place.But my criticism comes from the fact that even with everything that America has, the \"pull yourself up from your bootstraps\" idea is squandered because people interpret it as \"Pull myself up by pushing everyone else down.\" In some cases it's more literal like when people hire someone to work for them and they exploit them by working them long hours with little pay. In others, it's more figurative where people shit on others who aren't at their level like when people say that the homeless are lazy, or that people on unemployment are exploiting the system.

The standard of living here is such that we don't have to worry about bad water, deadly disease outbreaks, invading armies, famine, large-scale unemployment, low wages, blatant corruption, etc. And yes, it costs a premium to afford all of that, and more so than other places, but you typically can't find all that America has to offer in one place.But my criticism comes from the fact that even with everything that America has, the \"pull yourself up from your bootstraps\" idea is squandered because people interpret it as \"Pull myself up by pushing everyone else down.\" In some cases it's more literal like when people hire someone to work for them and they exploit them by working them long hours with little pay. In others, it's more figurative where people shit on others who aren't at their level like when people say that the homeless are lazy, or that people on unemployment are exploiting the system. And that spills over to the way that people treat members of the service industry from servers at a restaurant to nurses in a hospital.It comes from a sever case of being self-interested, selfish, and self-absorbed. This country is full of rude, inconsiderate people who shit on other people constantly for the most basic fact that those other people aren't them. Different Beliefs? Yeah, I'll shit on you.

If an individual animal is infected with multiple flu strains then it's possible for a single host cell to be infected by both, and for virion particles produced by that cell to be packaged with a mix and match collection of the 8 RNA pieces from either original strain. Meaning there are 2^8 possible \"offspring\" from the recombination (256), any one of which might be infectious in humans and potentially sufficiently different from other strains in humans for there not to be immunity to it.This is why you hear people talking about \"avian flu\" or \"swine flu\", they are referencing a new hybrid strain of some existing human flu and some existing bird or pig flu. Meanwhile, at any given time there are plenty of different existing flu strains circulating around different parts of the globe, most people haven't been exposed to all of them, so you have a chance of getting sick from any of them.

Biogenic carbon is much more fractionnated than inorganic carbon; and it's not subtle. Typically there is a 20 per mil difference at least. So, through this characterisation, we know that no commercial hydrocarbon resource  resulted from abiogenic processes. That is indeed junk science.But, as is often the case with pseudo-scientific flim-flam, it is built upon a small kernel of truth. There is one case where a specific hydrocarbon may be produced by inorganic processes and that is when ultramafic rocks get serpentinized. There are several chemical pathways which allow this, and one of them results in the production of a methane molecule ([see reaction 2a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinite#Serpentinite_reactions)). As previously said, any commercial methane accumulation resulting from this process would present a carbon stable  isotope signature which would stick out like a sore thumb ... and we haven't seen any of those.

This allows us to tag which bunch of organic matter was their [source rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_rock). But the method also would allow to discriminate between hydrocarbons derived from organic and inorganic sources, biogenic vs abiogenic if you wish. Biogenic carbon is much more fractionnated than inorganic carbon; and it's not subtle. Typically there is a 20 per mil difference at least. So, through this characterisation, we know that no commercial hydrocarbon resource  resulted from abiogenic processes. That is indeed junk science.But, as is often the case with pseudo-scientific flim-flam, it is built upon a small kernel of truth. There is one case where a specific hydrocarbon may be produced by inorganic processes and that is when ultramafic rocks get serpentinized. There are several chemical pathways which allow this, and one of them results in the production of a methane molecule ([see reaction 2a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinite#Serpentinite_reactions)).

Wait, let me explain.  Look, by gender neutral bathrooms, if you mean indepenent stalls for everyone, thats fine. But that isnt gonna work out in the vast majority of cases, cause 90% of the time when a guy goes to the bathroom, they go to pee. And peeing for guys takes all of 10 seconds. Thats why urinals are so popular. So if you install stalls, you're going to make things slower, at events like stadiums where you got lines out the back. So you have things like those huge throughs at stadiums where dudes just line up shoulder to shoulder and pee. This is also why you seldom see lines at mens bathrooms, but plenty and plenty of lines at women bathrooms. Ok. So ideally, you were to design a transgender bathroom, stalls only isn't gonna work out. An you can't make independent rooms because buildings don't have the space for that. So ideally you would want a mix of urinals, and a couple of stalls off to the side. >urinals, and a couple of stalls off to the side.This is exactly what a mens bathroom looks like. Theres nothing wrong with that. So we'll just turn all the bathrooms into mens bathrooms and make them gender neutral, so anyone can use them. Cool. Heres the thing. There are a lot of women who use mens bathrooms anyways. 9 times out of 10 when I see a women using the mens bathroom, we just assume its because the womans bathroom is full, or its a mother bringing her son into pee, or just some random woman, whatever. Its sorta socially acceptable to do this. Again, 9 times out of 10 most dudes would just look, wash their hands, and forget about it 10 seconds later. Since I was growing up, I have seen women using the mens bathrooms all the time. I don't care. So men are used to seeing women in their bathrooms. But women are NOT ok seeing men in women's bathrooms. Like, thats the type of shit you would get arrested for. So if we make all the bathrooms gender neutral, and install urinals and stalls in all of them, and both genders can use whatever - most dudes would be ok with that, but a lot of women would NOT be ok with that arrangement. Something about privacy and whatnot. That's the only problem I see with the whole thing. Maybe you could make seperate women and men bathrooms, then a third subset of gender neutral bathrooms. IDK. But either way, doing that is going to cost money, and you all know how money really drives everything in washington. Either way, men can use whatever bathroom their want, and pee wherever, and woman can now too - but without privacy from the opposite sex. So you gotta ask yourself, are you willing to give up privacy for an increased # of stalls available for use? (think like stadiums or large sporting events where you gotta wait in line)Some women would say yes, others would say no. What about breastfeeding? Some women would feel fine doing that in the womens bathroom, but maybe not in a gender neutral bathroom with a whole bunch of dudes walking around.

I've also never told anybody about this and it's a long post, so please be kind. I'm a 21 y.o. female. The first time was when I was around 7 years old. I'd always go over to my neighbors house to play with my best friend. She had an older brother who was around 15-16, I don't really remember. I had known them my whole life so I felt completely safe when I would go over there. One day we're playing hide and seek and her brother said he'd join us. My friend was \"it\" so I ran off to hide. Her brother, caught up to me and said we'd hide together. We found a hiding spot, he sat down and pulled me into his lap. I was just sitting with him at first, and I knew him, so it didn't seem weird to me. Then I remember he put his hand up my shirt and felt my chest, and after a minute or so he put his hand down my pants. I was young and naive, and didn't know what was happening; all I was worried about was getting \"found\". I'm guessing my lack of struggling and not saying anything encouraged him to continue this for almost a year until they moved. Whenever I'd go over there he'd grab me and set me on his lap. He'd make me straddle his legs. At first he'd just touch me, but it progressed to him penetrating me with his finger. I remember telling him that it hurt one time. He'd take my hand sometimes and make me rub his crotch. There would be a few times after he had penetrated me that he would smell his fingers afterwards. It never really occurred to me when this was happening that it was wrong. Thinking back I know I should've said something. The second time was when I was 11. I was staying at another friends house. I also had known them my entire life. They where very close family friends to where we referred to them as cousins, aunt and uncle. I stayed the night, and my friend had bunk beds in her room. I was sleeping on the top bunk that night. The thing is, is my friend and I had been having this long prank war with her brother whenever I'd stay the night. When he came in that night, it woke me up. I was expecting to get my face drawn on or something, and I was gonna scare him. I froze though when he started lifting my shirt up, so I kept playing like I was asleep. I didn't know what to do, so when he started touching my breast, I kept still. He tried to stick his hand down my pants but I guess he figured it'd \"wake me up\", so he gave up on that and eventually left. The next time I stayed the night he tried to touch me again but I acted like when he touched my shirt it woke me up a little and it scared him off. He didn't try it again. It's nice to finally get this off my chest, even if it is just to strangers. But I do have a question for anyone willing to answer. Was I only just molested, or is considered rape since I was penetrated? I've never really come to terms with what has been done to me, but I feel like if I know what to officially call it I can move on from it. Thank you to anyone that answers.

Obligatory I'm on mobile, sorry for the formatting. TLDR at bottom. Now here's the story:So I was on the highway on my way home from work stuck in traffic when I get the feeling that someone is staring at me. Not super unusual for me as I drive a classic car that I often get complements on. I turn my head expecting to see someone checking out my car but instead I see three Neanderthals gawking at me from their truck. They're all in the front seat as this truck had no backseat and literally pushing each other around trying to get a look at me. I immediately look away and refuse to look over again hoping they get the hint that they're making me uncomfortable. Nope! That would require having fully functional frontal lobes, which these troglodytes apparently lack. Once there was a break in the traffic I attempted to get as far away from them as possible but each time they would somehow manage to catch up to me and position themselves right next to me once the traffic would back up again. And every time I'd glance over they were drooling over me like I was a juicy steak. To say I was uncomfortable is an understatement. Finally the traffic cleared and I tell myself that there in fact is a God who is granting me to opportunity to loose these morons. I speed off from them and eventually come to my exit thinking I'm in the clear. Wrong! I glance in my rear view and there they were. At this point I wasn't too worried because they work for a fairly large landscaping company (according to the logo on the truck) and there's one in my town so I assume they're just going back and I happen to be unlucky enough to have to live in the same town as their destination.Finally, I get to my street. I live on a dead end with only a few houses and I know for a fact none of my neighbors use that landscaping company so when they put on their directional and turned when I did, I really started to shit my pants. I immediately call my bother (his car was in the driveway which I noticed as soon as I pulled up to my street.) He picks up right away as it is unusual for me to call him instead of text. SO he picks up and I hurriedly tell him that these three homo habili have followed me home. At this point they have gotten out of their vehicle and are knocking on my car window asking for my number, I've locked my doors and am refusing to acknowledge them. Then here comes my brother sprinting nearly as fast as Usain Bolt himself with a shovel screaming at the top of his lungs for them to get the fuck away from me (he's also a landscaper and happened to have some gardening weapons readily available) with my dog trailing behind. Now my brother is no small guy nor is my dog a small pupper so the pair is pretty intimidating and you'd think that would be enough right? Wrong again. These cavemen have the audacity to threaten to call the cops on my brother. After they followed me home! And are still standing on my property!! After it was made clear that they were not welcome!!! My brother had tp make a show of nearly striking one of the Paleolithic creatures with his shovel before they finally got the hint and high tailed it out of there. So to the three barbarians who followed me home: what the fuck were you thinking?? Following someone is STALKING which is of course ILLEGAL and you fully deserved the wrath of my brother. I hope you know I will be calling your boss and making sure they are aware of how you're using their company vehicle. I hope you get fired. And I hope some day someone DOES teach you the lesson my brother was fully willing to teach you before you sped away like the sorry flock of fowl you are. TLDR; got followed home by uncivilized creatures in their company truck. Brother and loyal dog scared them away and the idiots will hopefully be fired after I report them.

He asks me nonstop my \u201cfeminist opinion\u201d on certain topics. Like sexism in gaming. Or sexism in relationships. A good example is the recent #metoo campaign. He messaged me to ask me what it was about and I explained that anyone writing #metoo was openly identifying that they were victims of sexual assault/harassment. So he asked me how I defined sexual assault. What is assault? What is consent? Is there a gray area with consent? He had the whole attitude of \u201cit should be sooo obvious what consent is. I mean if a girl shirks away from my touch, that\u2019s obviously not consent. Guys need to be like me and learn to read the signs\u201d. He asked about why abuse is not reported / dealt with legally more often, and went off on a rant about corrupt cops when I responded. It felt like pandering. He asked me what I think of abuse within family context. He wanted details. What about a scenario where a father abuses a daughter? Why would he do that? Why would the girl not speak up? Why would the mom not do anything?He asked me in exhausting detail to explain how that could possibly happen. Then he asked me the exact same questions but with regards to \u201cless close family members, like an uncle or a cousin\u201d. And at this point I lose my temper and tell him he needs to do his own research. I tell him that if he cares to actually be an ally to women, he can do the research on this very common topic and he doesn\u2019t need a woman to baby step him through why abuse is bad. The entire thing felt like instead of caring about the topic, he was trying to pander to my strong feminist belief system and get on my good side, but I didn\u2019t bite because it all felt so sickly sweet and insincere. He acts like this 100% of the time around me. When ever we play a game together, he announces over mics \u201clet\u2019s do this, boys \u2014\u0000\u2014\u0000 and girl!\u201d If someone says a sexist slur like bitch or cunt, instead of telling the guy off, he makes a comment about how he would never say that because he\u2019s a gentleman. It\u2019s like he\u2019s all talk and no substance. I have a hard time putting it into words. Have you met guys like this?  How do you deal with them?

So I decided since I don\u2019t talk about it enough, I wanted to share my story, even though I\u2019m just a lurker on this sub. When I was 16 years old I was in a 6 month relationship with a boy who I thought I was going to stay with forever. He seemed nice and cool, very \u201chip\u201d with the local music scene. We were very sexually active, and had sex quite frequently, being 16 years old and whatnot. As I look back on it I realize a lot of his actions were incredibly problematic. When he wanted to stay up late watching movies when I had to work the next day, he forced me to drink energy drinks to stay up with him. When I tried to express my triggers for my anxiety, he blew me off. I admit, since I didn\u2019t have much experience with sex, some of what he did came off as coercive, but I thought it was just what happened in movies and tv shows where women just eventually accepted that they *had to* have sex with their partners. One night when we were alone, he told me he wanted to have sex, even though I was on my period at the time. I asked why, and he said that he wanted have anal sex. We had done it before, but not much. I said I didn\u2019t really want to, and he told me that he would be quick, and not hurt me. He did. I asked him to stop, and he told me to \u201cjust let him finish\u201d. I struggled with this for years, put it out of my mind, and forgot about it until I was in a stable relationship with my now partner, who I love. I told my current partner about my relationship with this boy, and it all poured out. There have been times when I\u2019ve confided in other women about this assault, because I \u201cdidn\u2019t think it counted as sexual assault\u201d. I had a friend who asked me if someone told me a similar story, would I consider it sexual assault, I said I would, but when it happens to you, it\u2019s hard to accept that you were assaulted. I\u2019ve accepted it. I was sexually assaulted. I\u2019m stronger now, and I have a partner who respects me and cares about me. Thank you all for listening to my story. PS, I thought I\u2019d add that this particular boy had been ostracized from our town, moved for college to Canada, and has been outed as an abuser by many women including myself. Several men and women in the DIY music scene who run venues have expressed that he\u2019s banned from the venues. (And not to advocate for violence, but many individuals have expressed that if he ever returns to the community, \u201che will pay for what he has done to the women of this city\u201d) ", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "77n3g9", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "#MeToo, not on Facebook, not really sure where to share.

But I\u2019ve probably encountered it the most in my own mind ever since I realized that some of my experiences were forms of sexual assault. Even since realizing that the things that happened to me were wrong, I still have a very hard time for seeing them as they are...sexual assault. I had wrongly only associated the word \u201cassault\u201d with violent bodily harm, which has made it harder for me to be real with myself about what happened.I\u2019m posting to come out with my own #metoo story because I\u2019m not comfortable sharing out on Facebook, but also to let others know that if they are wondering if something that made them uncomfortable \u201ccounts\u201d, it does! I've never shared this in this detail with anyone, not even my boyfriend or best friend. A lot of it was with my first boyfriend who was emotionally abusive. I was a virgin when we started dating. The sexual abuse started when he made me feel bad for putting a stop to things when we were making out and getting physical, that it was basically the worst thing to do to a guy, which affected the way I was intimate with some guys after him. So I just gave in to please him, without really thinking about what I wanted out of it. I lost my virginity to him, but what I didn\u2019t realize until several years later was that I didn\u2019t get a say in losing it. At the time, I was religious (no longer anymore) and had been dating my boyfriend for 2 years. He knew I wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, and we had done everything except sex until that point. We were messing around with no clothes on and his penis just slowly crept into my vagina, not all the way but still penetrated. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on. Looking back, I think I froze. After it took his penis out, he looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad we did that\u201d. At no point, did he ask me if I was okay with it or if I was ready, despite us having waited 2 years to have sex at that point and knowing how important it was to me at the time. I think I was so shocked and ashamed with myself for \u201cletting\u201d it happen, that I kind of had to just accept that I lost my virginity. What\u2019s more fucked up is, with cognitive dissonance in full gear, I convinced myself that I actually was okay with it (after all, people my age were having sex anyways), and even told him I was glad it happened, despite the shock pulsing within me. Later on, I went through bouts of shame and expressed to him multiple times, sometimes while crying, that I wanted to stop having sex and to wait until we were married (I had naively thought we would get married, thank goodness that didn\u2019t happen). But he would say \u201cokay\u201d and dismissed what I said, and try to have sex with me anyways, and I just \u201clet\u201d him. Sex was never enjoyable with him, I always felt it was something to endure. Even though I know the majority of sexual assault and rape happens from people we know, the fact that it was my own boyfriend still made it hard for me to really admit to myself what happened even as I type this. I would kind of freeze similarly with other guys I got intimate with in the future, and blamed myself \"letting\" it happen. There were a few other guys I went on first dates with who had tried to kiss me even though I wasn\u2019t comfortable yet. All of these experiences, I felt were hard to \u201ccount\u201d for a #metoo experience because it was with someone I was dating.

My husband was aware of the crude jokes Mr. B had made in the past, most recently at his daughters' wedding where he pointed out how \"topheavy\" I was (I have large breasts) and when I was on the dancefloor I needed to stop jumping around \"or you'll get a black eye with those things\". I brushed it off because he was drunk, because it was her wedding day, because it wasn't anything I hadn't heard 100 times before, because, because, because...Then last night my friend and I were telling the story of how I had introduced her to her husband and she introduced me to my husband. She said \"And they love each other.\" And I replied, \"And they love each other.\" And Mr. B said, with an eyebrow raised and in that smarmy dirty tone of voice, \"The two of YOU should love each other.\" I could not believe he said it. Suggesting girl-on-girl sex between your own daughter and her friend in a room full of men that are mostly strangers? She pretended not to hear and my husband was out of earshot talking with someone else. I was too dumbstruck to even say anything and the conversation was quickly steered to something else. I feel like this is how it always happens, how men that are crude and sexually aggressive test the boundaries to see what they can get away with. Can we brainstorm some short, firm answers to use in response to a situation like this? The one I keep coming back to is, \"That is wildly inappropriate.\"  I'd love to hear others so that I can include them in my arsenal and maybe be prepared the next time something like this happens.

I am at a work conference and last night after the festivities a female coworker and I went to grab a drink at the hotel bar.  Being a finance conference the crowd in the bar was about 5 women and about 200 men.  Since there was an open bar first I paced myself and stuck to one drink an hour, in total I had 5 drinks over a 7 hour span.  I was completely coherent until the last drink and then I blacked out and woke up in my own hotel room covered in vomit.  I have zero memory of the night after the moment I started my second drink at the bar.  I left my drink on the bar twice to run to the bathroom and my coworker said she watched it, but since she was talking to some people behind us at the bar I'm almost positive that someone slipped something in it.  I never black out like that and I am so terrified of what happened from the time that I don't remember.  I'm absolutely panicking and blaming myself for not taking my drink to the bathroom with me since I was once in this exact situation that ended with me being sexually assaulted by a former co worker at my last firm.  I can't handle how I am feeling and all of the old memories that I've been in therapy dealing with for years.  And I am scared that other people from my firm might have seen me like that and thought I was just drunk and be judging me for it.  I'm lucky that my coworker protected me from something worse happening and got me back to safety, but I am still shaking uncontrollably and don't know what to do.  Can someone offer me any advice?

I don't think what she said about race and health was coming from a place of hate but rather an instance of poor wording. There are some health factors that come from genetic predispositions , cultural habits and lower socio-economic status. When she talks about food she is saying that despite what she said about genetic factors the food is so good that pretty much everyone would be impacted to some degree but those with those predispositions more so. This was an attempt at humor and an appeal to southerners since quality food is often considered a source of pride. The fact that chicken was mentioned has people's racism  feelers out.  The news report also says fried chicken and she only said chicken.3. He asked why she was mocking black people. He did not do his research before asking this question because she was not mocking. She responded very well to this accusation. 4. The second question was misleading. The bill she voted against also included a provision that would remove gun rights from people subject to certain protection orders. Things get tacked onto common sense bills that make it not possible to vote for. The right political machine pushes for weak gun control but I could see this part of the bill being a legit problem given her beliefs. I am for pretty strong gun control but I think the question she was given intentionally painted a false/misleading narrative.4. Both questions were poorly researched and misleading. The fact that they were so misleading makes me think the parents were in on it.5. The news broadcast was pushing their view hardcore. Saying that her comments were racially charged puts a slant on what she said before the viewer even hears what she said. Saying she said fried chicken when she just said chicken makes it sound worse. Saying she was rusty on her recollection says she was lying or wrong about what she said when from what I have seen she maintained her stance and her recollection of events remained consistent.EVERYONE LOVES CHICKEN and she said that everyone loves chicken. Saying one group of people likes chicken is not racist but she did not even do that. She said that people in the south eat unhealthy food and black people are hit harder by the negative effects of that type of food.As far as the kid getting kicked out I think that is the wrong way to go. I would rather see them talk the issues out with him and his family. I think that his mom is pulling his strings and I don't think he should be punished for that.
