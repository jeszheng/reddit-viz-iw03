WL sends a bunch of DMs requesting information and trying to buddy up for leaks but Jr just doesn't even play along at all.

All they needed to make their mark was their first boogeyman, and that was Bill Clinton.With Clinton's election in 1992, conservatives went ballistic. They'd had a Republican in the White House for 12 straight years at that point, and they knew based on talk radio what would happen if a Democrat were in office. It was the nightmare scenario that'd played out on the radio every day for five years. Bill Clinton scared conservatives into electing Newt Gingrich.Since then facts have had a decreasingly significant role in Republican politics, which is how we got George W. Bush for president, how we got the Iraq War, how birthers came to believe our 44th president was a Muslim from Kenya, and how we now have Donald Trump, Roy Moore and a party with seemingly no standards whatsoever.This all started with the death of the Fairness Doctrine.

Newt Gingrich campaigns on republicans promising to go home each weekend as part of the Contract ~~On~~ With America. When the GOP is given majorities in both the House and Senate, so ends the tradition of cross-party weekend get-togethers. So too ends the tradition of bringing families to D.C. in the first place.This end of traditions also prevents the subsequent bonding and recognition of colleagues as people and not \"them\" to oppose \"us\".

It is also experiencing a massive brain drain. People were leaving because there aren't enough opportunities and because they have lost faith in the government. The loss of talented workers is hinder its economic vitality. The hurricane could be the finishing blow. From my (center-right) position, I am thinking that Puerto Rico needs life support and that we must act decisively. The requested disaster funds are necessary but not sufficient to stabilizing the situation. The governor and the people of PR should be prepared to undertake some meaningful reformations in exchange for federal help. 1) Disaster relief monies should be disbursed in small increments which are tied to specific disaster-recovery milestones. They get the full aid package but it comes in pieces. This would insure that the funds are used to repair damaged infrastructure and not on other projects or expenses.  1) Puerto Rico has a number of state-owned enterprises which operate inefficiently. Management of its state-owned corporations should be handed over to the private sector in exchange for long-term investments in infrastructure. For instance, if a corporation want to provide utilities (a stable, profitable business), then it first builds the power plant and invests in the distribution system. 2) Puerto Rico should be classified as a special economic zone for a period 10 years in order to attract private sector investment. Republicans senators love to talk about special economic zones as solutions for struggling regions. This would be a great time to test their commitment.  3) Allow PR to import products from other Caribbean nations. They are currently limited to importing products from the USA. This would result in a significant cost savings for their people. Everybody benefits from cheaper groceries, for instance.  4) Establish a federal relocation fund to entice overseas manufacturers to relocate to PR.

At least one method Twitter used in generating this list seems to be based on them tweeting hashtags Twitter has decided originate from Russian shills.

Even if we assume every hashtag thus identified genuinely originated with the Russian government, such a method is going to pick up a huge amount of noise from people who are active on twitter and spread the wrong new hashtag. Even if it's narrowed based on other factors, it would require very careful and rigorous statistical analysis to make sure the list isn't overwhelmed by false-positives when applied to a huge group like Twitter users.

Of course it was 99% promise with lots of gotchas they could wiggle out of. They tried it again after 9/11 (after a few previous attempts), though I can't remember what they claimed they'd do. Then they did it with Katrina, promising to roll out cheap broadband to the south with $20/month DSL for tax breaks. Turned out it was really a plot to get grandfathered customers off of their old plans and the $20/month didn't last long. Bait and switch. Oh, and of course more tax breaks.Eventually they noticed that people weren't getting landlines anymore, so they tried to get on the cell phone boom (and get lots of deregulation) with Obama phones (oh along with more tax breaks, cant forget those).Here is the one thing I've learned: You can't bribe the telco industry to do anything with tax breaks.

On the last letter they blacklisted me from renting from Enterprise, Alamo, and National Car Rental. They then sent the \"debt\" to a 3rd party collection agency who gave me 30 days to respond or else it would hit my credit. Seriously, Enterprise had ignored all of my attempts of communication to dispute the damage that was already noted on their rental agreement then sent the deal to a collection agency posing serious threat to my credit score. I responded to the collection agency with a physical, must be signed for, two-page letter with about 20 pages of supporting documents (emails, letters, phone transcripts). Below is the letter to the collection agency. I included a note that said that upon any collection attempts after the 30 day window I provided, (same as the collection agency had provided) the documents along with a complaint would be sent to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) along with my state's Attorney General's office.>This letter serves to inform you that the above referenced debt is in dispute and the invoice submitted by ERAC has been rejected as is. ERAC has been made aware of this, and has failed to address the situation in any way. It is the view of the undersigned that the current invoice submitted by ERAC is fraudulent and not valid.>In the following pages attached, detailed written communications are provided between myself and ERAC in the order that they occurred. >ERAC's agents have failed to provide any officially requested supporting documents for their invoice. ERAC's agents have only once responded to my attempts at communication, and in relation to that response they have gone on to directly contradict their stated actions. Generous time frames for providing feedback or response have been given to ERAC, but they have not met any of these deadlines. It is the view of the undersigned that ERAC has been the obstinate party in this dispute and has shown no evidence of attempts to rectify the situation or mediate a solution.>My communication with ERAC came to an abrupt halt when I received yet another letter from ERAC demanding payment with no correspondence addressing my concerns. In this letter ERAC also informed me that I am banned from renting from Enterprise, Alamo, and National Car Rental. Upon receipt of that letter, I gave the ERAC agent another call and in no kind words instructed the agent to read the emails (attached in the following pages), address the concerns, or we have nothing to talk about. I also informed them that as the person that manages travel for my company, I can no longer recommend their services based on these experiences, and that Alamo, Enterprise, and National Car Rental have been removed as preferred vendors from our travel portal.>ERAC has expended significant amounts of my time in what should be an extremely clear-cut matter. I will not pay for the invoice as is. I will not pay for prior damage that was noted on the rental car agreement and is included on this invoice. I will not pay for damage on the car that was not present when I returned the car.>As previously communicated to ERAC, myself as well as my insurance company has cited on the of ERAC: lack of cooperation, incomplete documentation, lack of return calls, lack of substantiation of claims, no indication of intent to resolve, and unresponsiveness to resolving the claim in a timely manner. ERAC is an obstinate party and the evidence contained herein verifies that.>Copies of this correspondence will be forwarded to the three major credit agencies as well as my attorney.>If you would like to speak to me directly, please email me at <email@email.com> to schedule a meeting.

Her defect is quite large, so it's unlikely she will ever walk without leg braces, and she does require intermittent cathing throughout the day, but she is undoubtedly better off than she would have been had we waited until she was born to have the surgery. With this surgery, you ideally see motor and sensory improvements up to two levels of the spinal cord. For example, my daughter's defect starts at L3, but with the surgery, she will hopefully have improved neurological function up to the L5 level. And while this doesn't seem like much, it can mean the difference between walking independently and being wheelchair bound.  The most important benefit of the surgery, however, is the reduction in the rates of hydrocephalus, or swelling in the brain, which can be devastating. After the surgery, my daughter's hydrocephalus vastly improved, and although she still eventually required a shunt(drain) to relieve some excess pressure in her brain, she's going to lead a cognitively normal life, which was my biggest desire for her. It's truly amazing what we can accomplish with modern medicine. One of the hospitals was even attempting this repair laparoscopically, which means not having to open the uterus all the way up.
