I spent my night at the bar drinking while the girls danced (I am not a dancer...or a club person really) and mostly spent the night with the girl I was seeing.

So...got drunk, went back to girlfriends place and because I had work the next day didn't stay the night.

That is good advice if you are worried about personally feeling awkward, but feeling awkward and \"being\" awkward are two different things. Awkward really means \"causing embarrassment or difficulty.\" Confidence in yourself can help to recognize that you are not causing people embarrassment, but there is a chance you actually are. I have known a few very confident people who were super awkward to be around.I think the main tactic I've learned to stop being awkward is to read the vibe in a situation and conform your behaviour to that vibe. A lot of people are awkward because they feel like they have to act in a certain way to be themselves despite being in situations that demand a certain pattern of behaviour. \"I am a quiet person, so even though I am with someone that wants to get to know me I will never talk.\" \"I'm the funny guy, so I will always deflect any serious topics even when people need me to empathize with a problem.\" \"I am not a rude person, I will never make jokes about sex or butts even when I agreed to play Cards Against Humanity.\"Disney movies and children's shows always try to say \"be yourself\" with some implication that you have to be a stock set of traits; but in reality the healthy way to be yourself involves changing your behaviour to fit the situation you are in. It hurts you and everyone around you if you can't both be professional in a meeting and relaxed at a bar. You are a person, not a character. Match the mood and no one will ever be embarrassed for you.Tl;dr: If you don't want to be a real life Michael Cera, recognize that acting differently in different situations is a good thing, not a bad thing.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4528, "stickied": false, "score": 230, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 13 18:54:59 2017", "ups": 230}, {"body": "I will tell you how my gf did.

All credit goes to /u/cmvr2256. This guy is amazing.  The story was posted on /r/Letsnotmeet, so anyone who does not frequent that sub and would not have seen this will hopefully enjoy it like I did:I've been reading stories on here for awhile now and figured I'd post my own. I had to get my brother to help recount this as I was 12 at the time (and scared shitless as a result).This happened about 6 years ago, as stated I was about 12 and my brother was 26 at the time. My brother had been serving in the U.S. Army for several years when this happened and was deploying to the Middle East on his 2nd deployment if i remember correctly. Also of note was that he is a Green Beret and had recently (3 or 4 months prior to this trip) completed the Army Special Forces Qualification Course (Robin Sage and all that), and by then was an active duty SF Engineer Sergeant. Definitely not someone you'd want to fuck around with.Given that we both grew up with a passion for the outdoors, he thought it would be nice to take me on a backpacking trip in northern Alabama (the Sipsey Wilderness for those familiar with the area) before he left for 9 months.The trip had gone smoothly up until the 3rd night we were camping out. Around 8pm we had our camp set up, eaten dinner and were sitting by the fire talking about typical boy shit- guns, girls, etc.For some reference, our spot was about 50 yards from a large stream, and about 50 yards downhill adjacent to the large path. Our camp, the stream, and the path formed a triangle of sorts.This was summertime in Alabama, so it wasn't quite dark yet when two guys, who looked to be in their late 20s wandered up and ask if we had seen any hogs while we were hiking around. Given that this is rural Alabama, we actually had seen some farther into the wilderness area and told them so.Even though they were relatively polite (my brother called them \"good ole boys\") I got a seriously creepy vibe from them-dirty clothes, greasy hair, scraggly facial hair, etc. I think they probably looked like they belonged in the movie \"Deliverance.\"They kinda hung out for a few minutes, maybe a little longer than they should have- looking around, asking us questions like how long we had been out there, how long we were staying, and what looked like them kinda sizing us up. They then abruptly said goodbye and walked away. I didn't necessarily feel threatened by them, and I know for sure my brother didn't, but I still felt uneasy about the whole thing.Fast forward 3 or 4 hours. My brother and I had gone to sleep and were nestled in our tent when I woke to the sound of multiple dogs barking. I've always been a heavy sleeper and they sounded like they were only about 100 yards away. My heart immediately started pounding and I kicked my brother through my sleeping bag and asked if he was awake/had heard the dogs. He responded \"I'm awake, they've been getting closer for the past hour or so, just lay still and don't make any sounds.\" Needless to say, 12 year old me was about to shit my pants. We would also hear sporadic shouts from several different sources but neither came any closer. A few minutes later my brother whispered, \"They're just hunting for hogs, they use the dogs to pin them down and then they shoot them.\" This gave me some relief, but not much. Somehow I managed to fall back asleep. The fact that they were doing this at night was a huge red flag my brother later told me, but I think he was just trying to keep me calm.Fast forward what was probably another 3 hours, around 2am. I had managed to sleep pretty well after first hearing the hog hunters when I woke up to my brother squeezing my shoulder firmly, saying \"wake up, put your shoes on quick and follow me, be as quiet as you can.\" My heart immediately went back to racing because I heard the dogs and voices in the distance, farther away than before but still distinct. Not asking any questions I did what he said and as soon as we were out of the tent he told me to get on his back (this was a breeze for him after rucking with God knows how much weight in the Army). We snuck about 50 yards into the woods towards the junction of the path and the stream and crawled into some bushes. It was up a hill so we had a pretty good elevated view of our campsite.I remember as we were laying there how loudly I was breathing and how quiet he was when I heard the very distinct sound of a pistol slide racking. I looked over and my brother had his pistol (a HK USP that he gave to me a few years after this story took place) and was watching the campsite and surrounding area. I started to whisper to him when he put his hand over my mouth and pointed at the campsite.The group of hunters had been steadily approaching our camp and by this time (30 or so minutes) had reached it. There were 5 of them and like 3 or 4 dogs. They all looked relatively young but two had either rifles or shotguns and the dogs were going crazy, obviously having smelled our scent.For those of you who are backpackers/campers, nobody who comes up on a random camp in the middle of the night with dogs and guns and has good intentions. I knew this, and my brother knew this. I was scared shitless. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but my brother later told me they were talking about us, although he hadn't heard any specifics either.They lingered for about 20 minutes shining flashlights around and talking to themselves when my brother put his mouth to my ear and said \"If they come towards I want you to turn and run as quickly as you can, don't stop, don't look back, stay off the trail and look for the flashing lights\" (I didn't know what he meant by this but that'll come later). I knew I could make it back because he had taught me 'land nav' pretty well. He then handed me a flashlight and told me not to take the red filter off. He told me later that the red filter helps preserve night vision and cuts down ambient light so it would be harder for someone to see from a distance.At this point I was so scared I almost started crying, but at the same time had a rush of adrenaline and what I think now was confidence that he thought I could handle myself.We laid there for awhile longer when out of nowhere they started screaming \"WHERE YALL AT?!?!\" and firing into the woods at random. My brother dragged me back behind the crest of the hill and threw himself on top of me. Thankfully our position on top of the hill we were protected from any gunfire.They shot maybe 5 or 6 more times and then started walking back the direction they had come. They got maybe 100 yards away when I heard a blaring siren and saw emergency lights flashing through the woods. Turns out my brother had called the Forest Service Office on a satellite phone my family has for emergencies while I was asleep and they had sent out Forest Service officers and game wardens to our area of the wilderness. The Sipsey Wilderness is about 25,000 acres in size so it took them awhile to get there on the dirt roads.When we saw the game warden truck my brother signalled them with the light and pointed them in the direction the hunters had gone and the guy sped off shining his spotlight through the woods.As soon as they were all gone we went back to our camp, packed up our shit and waited by the path for the game warden to come back, who then gave us a ride in his truck bed back to the main staging area.On the drive back my brother told me how brave I had been and that we would talk about it with our parents the next day if I wanted to. I asked him not to do that because I thought they might never let me go camp again.Creepy rednecks in the woods, lets not meet again, you might get shot next time.Follow up: We never got any definitive information on what happened to the rednecks we encountered. I have many friends who have gone out to the Sipsey area and had a great time with no creepy stuff going on. However it is truly a \"wilderness\" area and law enforcement response (if you can even reach them) would be slow. I was lucky that my brother was there and reacted so quickly otherwise who knows what could have happened. We also got lucky that whatever their intentions were, they either reconsidered or lost interest. I will note that when they left our camp the game warden showed up pretty soon afterwards but I didn't see what the guys and their dogs did. If I remember correctly they headed in a direction parallel to the stream, away from the trail inaccessible to any kind of vehicle. Maybe the warden continued on and took another trail to try and cut them off? We waited around 30 minutes for him to come back and he said there were other officers out looking. There are only so many paths that you could take a truck or quad bike down so any thorough search effort would also have to be done on foot.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5806, "stickied": false, "score": 222, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 13 23:08:08 2017", "ups": 222}, {"body": "When I was a kid in the mid 90s my friends and I were hiking around in the woods behind our house on some Weyerhaeuser timber property and found an abandoned farm house.The weird thing was that the house had been left very suddenly.

I took my children camping at a state park with campsites around a lake. It wasn't primitive camping, more like \"set up your tent with the car parked 20 feet away\" camping.We're sitting around the campfire after sunset making s'mores, when a car pulls up to the campsite next to us. It's about 35 yards away and it's dark, so we can't see who are new neighbors are. I feel a little bad because they have to use the headlights on their car  to see what they are doing while they set up their tent. I wanted to offer to help, but with children and an open fire, I thought my attention would be best used right where I was at.So later, we put out the fire and everyone goes to bed in their tents. I don't think about the campsite neighbor any more.In the morning, just as the sun is rising, there is beautiful music coming from across the lake. It was a solo performance using low brass. The musician plays three lengthy songs, maybe 15 minutes of music. This gets me out of the tent so that I can enjoy the fresh air by the lake with an unexpected live performance.Once the music ends, I look over at the neighbors campsite. I guess they're deep asleep or not impressed enough to come out the tent.I start a new fire to get ready for breakfast. About 10 minutes later, I see the campsite neighbor hiking back to his tent carrying a tuba. I'm in the middle of cooking so it takes me a few minutes to go over and thank him for the nice early morning concert. (I genuinely enjoyed it.) By the time I get over to the campsite, he has already put away the tuba, packed up his belongings, and had his tent half put away.I tell him that I'm both impressed at his playing ability and grateful for the nice surprise. And then that is when I noticed it. This guy only has one arm. All of this would have been impressive for just one person to do (setting up a tent in the dark, hiking with a heavy tuba in the dark so that you can perform a sunrise serenade, and tearing down a campsite in minutes), but this guy did it one armed.

I'm straight so I turned her down.This wasn't something that Kate was very happy to accept. She told the two other girls in our friend group that she had told me she was gay and that I basically hadn't accepted her and now didn't want to be around her anymore. While Kate didn't come out to anyone the three basically convinced my entire high school drama club (which we were all really involved in, irony I know) that I was basically a lying, intolerant, etc. bitch and no one talked to me for the majority of senior year starting around October or so when shit really hit the fan. That is until I completed my incredibly drawn out and twisted revenge plan.First we'll start with what I did to the girl that led the crusade. We'll call her Lena after her idol Lena Dunham. I had nearly all of my classes with this girl and we had been applying for college at the same time. Lena told me that she was excited to apply for Oberlin College and would be hearing back soon. They had kept up this bizarre pseudo-friendship with me for a while so I knew when Lena got denied early from the school. Except she told everyone that she hadn't been denied, but that her family was unable to afford it. For her, I got a bunch of teachers together to help her get scholarships so that she could afford to go to her dream school. She had to admit to each and every one of them that she had actually been denied.The next one, we'll call her Becky, who didn't do anything terrible other than sort of go along with it and egged them on occasionally I got a little worse with because it was so easy. This was a surprisingly toxic friend group when it started to fall apart but for some reason none of them realized that I have a very good memory and one time during a sleepover they had talked about their facebook passwords. I took screenshots of Lena and Kate's conversations about Becky and would hide them in a folder in Becky's email because Becky used the same password for both. I let these amass for months until I started in on my final part for Kate.I stayed absolutely silent until late March of senior year on why Kate and I had suddenly stopped being best friends. I knew that people wouldn't want to listen to me and that it wasn't worth creating a prolonged fight over. But with time some people were talking to me again and Kate wasn't the victim she had been months ago. So I started it then. Kate still hadn't told anyone (except maybe Lena and Becky I honestly can't say for certain) the real reason we weren't as close. So instead of being the person who would tell everyone I found a way to make her do it instead.We had this friend who literally could not keep a secret if you paid him to and he didn't care about that at all. It was a point of personal pride almost. I didn't tell him directly because that would be really low, but at the time I convinced myself that this was better. I told him that if he wanted to see something funny that he should tell Kate that he knew what happened at that one summer grad party. I didn't give him any details, didn't say anything at all, and didn't tell him that it had anything to do with us not talking.The next week Kate went around asking people if they had heard the awful rumor I was spreading about her. I had multiple people come and ask me if it was true. I would only ever reply \"Where did you hear it from?\" Until they all realized that she had said it herself. I hadn't said a word but now everyone knew why she had suddenly fallen really hard out of love.When even Becky and Lena start wondering if the story she told them is true they stick with her initially.

I wanted to get there when they opened because I knew if it came between  me and another customer I wouldn't get the full service. I get there early and the sign isn't lit up.  Well a man and his son go for the door and apparently it was open.So I go in and of course the guy gives them the full service. It comes to me and the guy says, \"Okay. We need your size. Try this one for the size. Once we know size we will pick something out.\"I try it on and we get the size. Next thing I know this guy is talking about ordering the suit. Hasn't asked if I liked it, showed me what the color I asked for will look like, etc.I need a suit and didn't feel like trying to convince this guy to let me look around a bit because he was pushing this suit on me so hard. I give in and later regret it so I call and ask a question. Turns out that suit may not be in stock / made any more and they won't know until Monday.So now my scheming and manipulating the situation mode kicks on. I am thinking how can I minimize issues. What can I do to ensure I get a suit for the wedding by the wedding.What made the most sense was to go in then and there and pick out a back up suit. It was Saturday and the store was open for 3 more hours. I could pick out a suit and then Monday if they tried to order the first one and it wasn't in stock then they could just order the other one.The alternative would be me waiting for them to call me in Monday THEN going in and picking out a different suit and then them ordering it Tuesday instead of Monday.So I start to ask the guy if I should pick out a second suit. He won't let me explain the backup concept or the saving time concept. He wasn't understanding that he works there. Me coming in Monday is no extra time for him. He doesn't have to race across town before close and pick out a suit in the heat of the moment instead of right then where I literally had three hours to choose something else.So this guy is cutting me off and patronizing me. Lying saying he'll call. Which he never did and I knew he wasn't going to call. I knew he was just telling me something. I wasn't being rude or anything. Just asking if I should get a second suit picked out then just to be safe.So he dismisses me and we're off the phone. My cell phone was cracked and old any way and I hated it. I just slammed it on the floor and then pulled it apart.This is how every single situation in my life goes. I go to do something simple and it turns into a long drawn out thing. I have had experiences where something took me forever and was a pain and someone I knew needed to do it so I gave them some tips and they acted confused and just went and had it all sorted in 60 seconds.I forget so often that this isn't the norm for people.

I hadn't said a word but now everyone knew why she had suddenly fallen really hard out of love.When even Becky and Lena start wondering if the story she told them is true they stick with her initially. Which is when I send an email from to Becky (from herself) to check the spam folder of her account and search for messages titled \"Facebook Thoughts.\"To my knowledge the girls don't talk that much anymore.TL;DR Girls are mean to me in high school.

Two data points is not a useful tend and there's at least a 130,000 year difference between them.  To put that in context anthropology puts the migration of modern humans out of Africa at something between 60-130,000 years ago.  So these aren't small variations in time.  Furthermore a super eruption completely reconfigures the volcanic edifice and plumbing system,  so there is no reason to expect that one supereruption will behave the same way as a previous one.  Anyone telling you about cyclicity or due dates on large volcanoes is severely misinformed.Ok,  so onto how we monitor and forecast.  Supervolcanoes are problematic in that we've never seen one erupt, so we have to go on geological evidence of past eruptions,  then a lot of applied rock physics. For a super eruption to go off the first thing is that we need over a thousand cubic kilometres of eruptable magma in the reservoir.  Eruptable is an important distinction. Lots of magma can get isolated off into unconnected mushes and parts of the plumbing.  Or can intrude as dykes which relatively rapidly cool down.  We can use seismic arrays to image plumbing systems (think ultrasound imaging - similar process,  different frequency) and estimate melt volumes,  but the resolution of these is still very low.  So we can track roughly how much melt is available.  Next is inflation of the volcano.  More magma underneath means the surface bulges more.  Given the the Yellowstone magma reservoir is something like 80km across this is a significant and easy thing to track (we can track surface motions of less than a millimeter with comparative ease).So there's plenty we can look at.  The issue is one of context.  We've only known about supervolcanoes for a couple of decades or so.  Our monitoring of them has been similarly short and often patchy.  So understanding them is a bit like throwing a Dr in a room with a patient, and  giving them 1 minute with nothing but a thermometer and reflex hammer to diagnose their complete medical requirements and estimate their life expectancy. These volcanoes simply do not work on human timescales.  Peaks and troughs in their activity are perfectly normal.  Perhaps even more importantly these thing erupt all the time! Its just that *most of their eruptions* are not super eruptions. So increases in seismic activity are not signs of imminent super eruption (Or even,  necessarily,  minor eruption). So we can be pretty confident that Yellowstone is not in immediate threat of super eruption; it's not close to what appears to be inflated enough to drive a super eruption.  And by immediate I mean in the next 10-20,000 years.  That said we have no idea what the magma recharge rate is at the moment or how it varies over time.

I have some suggestions you can try to find the origin of the problem:-Check for condition variations. Pure iPrOH and water are miscible in all proportions **at room temperature**. But if the mixture contains other compounds, the miscibility might change (I used to work with a 1:1 mixture of water and acetonitrile which are fully miscible, but after solving LiCl, miscibility dropped and became very dependent of temperature). A few degrees of difference in temperature might cross the line from 1 phase to 2 phases, and this implies a change in composition as both phases will be different. As an anecdote I know a couple of Physics who had problems with the magnetism of a sample a few years ago, as the new measurements were completely different from the measurements that made 4 months before. It turned out the sample contained gadolinium and the critical temperature is very close to room temperature. The first measurements where in winter (just under Tc) and the following in summer (above Tc), and that made a huge difference in its properties.-As you suggest, it might not be mixed as well as it should. It doesn\u2019t harm if before the first measurement you vigorously mix/stir the sample. It won\u2019t hurt and it will fix it in case it was the problem.-Some mixtures look homogeneous but they aren\u2019t. A true heterogeneous will form 2 phases or at least will look milky or opaque. If it looks clear, it might be a colloid. It is unlikely, but testing for it requires only 5 seconds. Just make use of the Tyndall effect to discard the presence of a colloid. If the solution is Tyndall positive, well\u2026 it\u2019s not homogeneous.-Are you sure the container is completely sealed between assays? If the container is not tight, some solvent might evaporate. iPrOH will evaporate faster than water, and composition can change (Raoult law\u2019s). Also, check the cap of the bottle. The iPrOH tank I used to have in my laboratory had a tiny hole to protect it fror overpressures, and that might be a leak for your tank.

I have some suggestions you can try to find the origin of the problem:-Check for condition variations. Pure iPrOH and water are miscible in all proportions **at room temperature**. But if the mixture contains other compounds, the miscibility might change (I used to work with a 1:1 mixture of water and acetonitrile which are fully miscible, but after solving LiCl, miscibility dropped and became very dependent of temperature). A few degrees of difference in temperature might cross the line from 1 phase to 2 phases, and this implies a change in composition as both phases will be different. As an anecdote I know a couple of Physics who had problems with the magnetism of a sample a few years ago, as the new measurements were completely different from the measurements that made 4 months before. It turned out the sample contained gadolinium and the critical temperature is very close to room temperature. The first measurements where in winter (just under Tc) and the following in summer (above Tc), and that made a huge difference in its properties.-As you suggest, it might not be mixed as well as it should. It doesn\u2019t harm if before the first measurement you vigorously mix/stir the sample. It won\u2019t hurt and it will fix it in case it was the problem.-Some mixtures look homogeneous but they aren\u2019t. A true heterogeneous will form 2 phases or at least will look milky or opaque. If it looks clear, it might be a colloid. It is unlikely, but testing for it requires only 5 seconds. Just make use of the Tyndall effect to discard the presence of a colloid. If the solution is Tyndall positive, well\u2026 it\u2019s not homogeneous.-Are you sure the container is completely sealed between assays? If the container is not tight, some solvent might evaporate. iPrOH will evaporate faster than water, and composition can change (Raoult law\u2019s). Also, check the cap of the bottle. The iPrOH tank I used to have in my laboratory had a tiny hole to protect it fror overpressures, and that might be a leak for your tank. Also, a very slight composition change might happen if you just open the bottle and then close it again. The solvent vapor will leave and when you close, it will re-evaporate until achieving vapor pressure, which will change very slightly the composition.

This basically means that if you do not do work on a system, you can not decrease the entropy. Obviously if you do work, you can decrease the entropy. This is like saying, I can take a pile of lumber and build a house by doing work on the wood, but the wood will never spontaneously enter a lower energy state. The way that this statement relates to a perfectly efficient engine is then the following:The efficiency of a heat engine is how much of the energy going in is converted into work. If you had a perfectly efficient engine, then you could attach it to a heat reservoir and the engine would just take the thermal energy from the reservoir and  convert all of it into usable work. This work could then be used to lower the entropy of some system. However since the engine is perfect, it did not itself cause any increase in entropy in the generation of work. Thus this perfectly efficient heat engine can be used to lower the overall entropy of the system.

You know, he just supports the cult of personality that calls for abolishing broadcast organizations that share opinions unfavorable to or critical of the dear leader, like something out of North Korea or Russia.By the way, Sean, I loved how hard you tried to make Trump look great in that interview, very clearly meant to appeal to his vanity. Shame he's such a colossal fuck up he **still** managed to make an embarrassment of himself and disrespect the flag by talking through the 'Retreat' bugle and making dipshit remarks about it's purpose, huh?

If, as an individual, a women wants to do that fine.But it shouldn't be used as a campaign to prevent rape. It shouldn't be, that collectively, as a society, we tell women not to get raped. Rape is prevented by teaching young people about consent and what is rape, and by telling people not to rape. Not by telling women not to get raped. Because if we start saying \"why hasn't she taken self-defense classes?\" Its a slippery slope to why was her skirt so short? Why did she drink that much? Or why did she leave with him? And then, might as well question if she said no loud enough? Was it really clear that she didn't want it? Because she probably wanted it. And, as a society, we have to stop putting the burden of getting raped, or not, on women and placing it on the people who actually rape. >One of the narratives arising from this hashtag was women being outraged by us men not doing more: essentially a call for us to \"step up\" and stop shielding criminals behind some sort of \"bro-code\" that normalized rapist behavior as a natural consequence of our testosterone or whatever. I didn't really understand the logic behind those accusations, Because too often rape and sexual assault are placed under \"well you know, boys will be boys\" or \"it's locker talk\". If it's locker talk than maybe other men could say that that kind of talk isn't funny, that that kind of talk isn't welcomed. And that touching a women without her consent isn't okay. Or because a male judge has sentenced an athlete to 6 months of jail time because \"his life would be ruined otherwise, he's a bright young man with a bright future ahead of him\". Nevermind him being a rapist. That rapist ended up doing only 3 months of jail time. That has to change. That's the \"bro-code\" or rape culture feminist are talking about. >similar to how earthquake or tornado-preparation drills are provided by the government as a free service to its citizensAre you comparing rape to natural disasters? Like rapes are just part of nature and we can't prevent them? And there's nothing we can do against them other then getting prepared for when they come? >To my shock, immediately I was accused of \"victim-blaming\" because I was supposedly placing the burden of action on women, when instead I should be suffocating \"rape culture\" by doing ... I'm not exactly sure what, to be honest. Admonishing aspiring rapists not to rape, and simply hoping for the best? Advocating for random searches of men on the street to make sure they weren't packing date-rape drugs? Pre-emptively jailing men with abnormally high testosterone levels as a safety precaution?Most rapes are not the kind of rapes where the victim didn't know her attacker and was overpowered in a dark alley. Most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, someone the victim feels safe with, or is too intoxicated to fight back. So self-defense are useless when you physically can't fight or when you freeze and dissociates while someone you trusted is using your body without your consent. >since you can't snuff out their existence entirely, you can at least take steps to ensure their eventual effect on the world is as *minimal* as possible. We probably can't prevent all the rapes but we can prevent it. With education, early on. We can teach consent and when someone can't consent. Its been proven that it helps reduce the number of rapes. >\"if victim-blaming is a thing, then why do modern homes come with door-locks installed? Is it smart to shift the narrative away from locking doors or cars, and start focusing instead on how we can stop 'burglar culture' from violating people's privacy?\"Are you comparing women to material property? Are you suggesting we lock up women at night because men might be tempted to rape them ? Because men have such poor self-control that they wouldn't be able to avoid using a women without her consent?I am appalled. I believe men have more control than that. Its sad that you don't think they do. Burglar culture isn't one. Rape culture is. >Forgive me if I'm wrong, but \"stop expecting *women* to do something about sexual violence!\" sounds a *lot* to me like \"until criminals stop being criminals, we feminists are okay with women being exposed to *as* much risk as statistically possible\".Women consider the danger of going out at all time. \"Will I have to walk alone in the dark in that of the city?\" \"That park looks too dark, I'll go around\" Some girls when they go out, use the motto of \"leave no men be hind\" because it's too risky to. They make they all come back together. I have personally pushed men of my friends that were too drunk to consent numerous times in bars. We protect each other.  Remind me how women do nothing? >All I'm wondering at is the wisdom of \"the philosophy of female inaction\", which in this particular context sounds a *lot* like the very same \"damsel-in-distress\" worldview that modern feminism takes a public stance *against*: the crusade against \"victim-blaming\" seems to imply that women are helpless in doing something against sexual violence, and must rely entirely on the goodwill and action of men in order for this problem to be overcome.So asking men to not rape women is acting like damsels in distress. Again, I didn't think men had such weak will power that it was such an outrageous request. I think that telling someone to not do something when a whole culture tells them that they can, that standing up for your safety and that of your friends is fucking badass. Not damsels in distress.

I didn't really understand the logic behind those accusations, but I figured the people leveling them weren't being malicious in doing so, and so I offered my two cents on the matter to add a slightly dissenting opinion to the mix.One of the ideas I raised online was subsidized self-defense classes for people across the nation, similar to how earthquake or tornado-preparation drills are provided by the government as a free service to its citizens (I actually remember being part of something like this in 7th grade, but those \"lessons\" were *way* too short and absolutely worthless, outdated crap by modern standards). My idea was to have MMA fighters like Bas Rutten and Ronda Rousey contracted by the government to offer practical, real-world tips on how somebody (especially with lighter bodyweight and/or confined surroundings) could make the most of any situation, and upload these tutorials as a free resource for anyone to learn at home. It wouldn't be a perfect solution by any means, but simply a small step towards ensuring the social footprint of sexual violence becoming as small as possible.To my shock, immediately I was accused of \"victim-blaming\" because I was supposedly placing the burden of action on women, when instead I should be suffocating \"rape culture\" by doing ... I'm not exactly sure what, to be honest. Admonishing aspiring rapists not to rape, and simply hoping for the best? Advocating for random searches of men on the street to make sure they weren't packing date-rape drugs? Pre-emptively jailing men with abnormally high testosterone levels as a safety precaution?See, here's where I start to not understand the whole backlash against supposed \"victim-blaming\": I'm a huge fan of martial arts, and one of the core tenets of basically any art is sufficient preparation for the world around you; this is because it's essentially taken for granted that there will *always* be criminals out there, and since you can't snuff out their existence entirely, you can at least take steps to ensure their eventual effect on the world is as *minimal* as possible. Yes, it's also a relatively violent outlook by conventional Western standards, but as a personal believer in the death penalty for rapists of any age and gender, I've pretty much \"drawn my line in the sand\" on that issue.The online discussions devolved into bickering not long after that, but a retort I wish I followed up with was \"if victim-blaming is a thing, then why do modern homes come with door-locks installed? Is it smart to shift the narrative away from locking doors or cars, and start focusing instead on how we can stop 'burglar culture' from violating people's privacy?\" Forgive me if I'm wrong, but \"stop expecting *women* to do something about sexual violence!\" sounds a *lot* to me like \"until criminals stop being criminals, we feminists are okay with women being exposed to *as* much risk as statistically possible\".Don't get me wrong, nobody is claiming that self-defense classes are magically going to eradicate all rape, or that all attackers are unrelated strangers to each victim, or even that self-defense lessons are *guaranteed* to help you in an assault situation. All I'm wondering at is the wisdom of \"the philosophy of female inaction\", which in this particular context sounds a *lot* like the very same \"damsel-in-distress\" worldview that modern feminism takes a public stance *against*: the crusade against \"victim-blaming\" seems to imply that women are helpless in doing something against sexual violence, and must rely entirely on the goodwill and action of men in order for this problem to be overcome.I appreciate any and all opinions on the matter at hand, and although I don't expect to find common ground with the majority of people in this Sub, I can at least feel better knowing that I tried to learn something I didn't know before.Cheers, mates**Edit:** Here are some articles that share my particular opinion, and I'm wondering whether the people of this Sub agree with them (or why they don't) - [I](https://www.newstatesman.com/society/2014/06/suggesting-women-learn-self-defence-opposite-victim-blaming) [II](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/i-dont-believe-selfdefence-training-is-victim-blaming-and-im-a-feminist/news-story/c84cfbdbf94430344f9647894dacb345) [III](https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/07/self-defense-blame-victims/) [IV](https://gendersociety.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/empowering-women-not-just-protecting-them/)[Here](https://everydayvictimblaming.com/evb-analysis/this-thing-about-feminist-self-defence/#more-%27) is also a counter-argument for people interested, although I admit I wasn't really able to boil down that article to its basic points :|", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "761xjd", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "I'm Having Trouble Distinguishing Between The Terms \"Victim-Blaming\" And \"Safety Precautions\"", "num_comments": 6, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 581, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/761xjd/im_having_trouble_distinguishing_between_the/", "submission_time": "Fri Oct 13 06:38:50 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "You wrote a lot of stuff to say, \"I advocated victim blaming and people did not like it.\"We have drills for tornadoes and fire b/c those things are usually natural, totally uncontrollable, and outside of any sphere of understanding that Nipplesweat, Kansas IS NOT interested in being wiped off the map by swirling wind.Rapists can absolutely decide if they are going to touch a person, say something disgusting, or insert parts of their body into parts of someone else's body.

If, as an individual, a women wants to do that fine.But it shouldn't be used as a campaign to prevent rape. It shouldn't be, that collectively, as a society, we tell women not to get raped. Rape is prevented by teaching young people about consent and what is rape, and by telling people not to rape. Not by telling women not to get raped. Because if we start saying \"why hasn't she taken self-defense classes?\" Its a slippery slope to why was her skirt so short? Why did she drink that much? Or why did she leave with him? And then, might as well question if she said no loud enough? Was it really clear that she didn't want it? Because she probably wanted it. And, as a society, we have to stop putting the burden of getting raped, or not, on women and placing it on the people who actually rape. >One of the narratives arising from this hashtag was women being outraged by us men not doing more: essentially a call for us to \"step up\" and stop shielding criminals behind some sort of \"bro-code\" that normalized rapist behavior as a natural consequence of our testosterone or whatever. I didn't really understand the logic behind those accusations, Because too often rape and sexual assault are placed under \"well you know, boys will be boys\" or \"it's locker talk\". If it's locker talk than maybe other men could say that that kind of talk isn't funny, that that kind of talk isn't welcomed. And that touching a women without her consent isn't okay. Or because a male judge has sentenced an athlete to 6 months of jail time because \"his life would be ruined otherwise, he's a bright young man with a bright future ahead of him\". Nevermind him being a rapist. That rapist ended up doing only 3 months of jail time. That has to change. That's the \"bro-code\" or rape culture feminist are talking about. >similar to how earthquake or tornado-preparation drills are provided by the government as a free service to its citizensAre you comparing rape to natural disasters?

Pre-emptively jailing men with abnormally high testosterone levels as a safety precaution?Most rapes are not the kind of rapes where the victim didn't know her attacker and was overpowered in a dark alley. Most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, someone the victim feels safe with, or is too intoxicated to fight back. So self-defense are useless when you physically can't fight or when you freeze and dissociates while someone you trusted is using your body without your consent. >since you can't snuff out their existence entirely, you can at least take steps to ensure their eventual effect on the world is as *minimal* as possible. We probably can't prevent all the rapes but we can prevent it. With education, early on. We can teach consent and when someone can't consent. Its been proven that it helps reduce the number of rapes. >\"if victim-blaming is a thing, then why do modern homes come with door-locks installed? Is it smart to shift the narrative away from locking doors or cars, and start focusing instead on how we can stop 'burglar culture' from violating people's privacy?\"Are you comparing women to material property? Are you suggesting we lock up women at night because men might be tempted to rape them ? Because men have such poor self-control that they wouldn't be able to avoid using a women without her consent?I am appalled. I believe men have more control than that. Its sad that you don't think they do. Burglar culture isn't one. Rape culture is. >Forgive me if I'm wrong, but \"stop expecting *women* to do something about sexual violence!\" sounds a *lot* to me like \"until criminals stop being criminals, we feminists are okay with women being exposed to *as* much risk as statistically possible\".Women consider the danger of going out at all time. \"Will I have to walk alone in the dark in that of the city?\" \"That park looks too dark, I'll go around\" Some girls when they go out, use the motto of \"leave no men be hind\" because it's too risky to. They make they all come back together. I have personally pushed men of my friends that were too drunk to consent numerous times in bars. We protect each other.  Remind me how women do nothing? >All I'm wondering at is the wisdom of \"the philosophy of female inaction\", which in this particular context sounds a *lot* like the very same \"damsel-in-distress\" worldview that modern feminism takes a public stance *against*: the crusade against \"victim-blaming\" seems to imply that women are helpless in doing something against sexual violence, and must rely entirely on the goodwill and action of men in order for this problem to be overcome.So asking men to not rape women is acting like damsels in distress. Again, I didn't think men had such weak will power that it was such an outrageous request. I think that telling someone to not do something when a whole culture tells them that they can, that standing up for your safety and that of your friends is fucking badass. Not damsels in distress.

Not because he sounded mad or something, but because whenever my parents say they need to talk, I'm trying to remember the last stupid thing I did.So anyway he tells me this story about his childhood. I'd always known my dad's dad was dead, but I never knew how he died. Apparently, he killed himself a little after my dad was born. My grandma was a single mother and they struggled with money for a long time. My dad grew up in a very poor and dangerous area. He goes through a few stories about things he experienced and told me that once when he was 19 he had gotten into some trouble. Nothing too terrible but he had a fight with some kid from school. So my dad, because of not having his own father, has always talked about how he wanted to be a great dad. My grandma told me that if you asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up he'd say he wanted to be a dad. So after this fight he had my grandma asked him \"would you want your future children to be friends with someone like you, or do you think you have some work to do?\" So in the midst of him telling me this story he started to cry. He said that he spent the next few days after that walking around their house thinking about what he wanted for his future kids and how he at one point felt hopeless because he thought he could never be good enough, in his words, \"to be worthy of bringing another person into the world.\"So the he turned his head and looked at me and he told me he still very often feels like he's not the father we deserve. He told me (I'm going to quote him as closely as I can)\"I look at you, and I feel so much pride in the person, you've grown into. And I want you to know it right now that every single day since the day your mother told me she was pregnant, I've felt humbled and honored to be able to say that I was a father, and today I feel grateful that I've been able to watch you grow into this awesome young woman.\"That felt so incredible to hear him say he was proud of me.

Its 1am and I\u2019m crying because of something I read about a dad on the interent! Not again! My dad is the same kind of person. His goal in life was to be a dad, of daughters no less. In highschool he read books (googling for the 70\u2019s) about how to do girl\u2019s hair so he\u2019d be ready for his daughter some day. In college he studied early childhood education because he wanted to teach kindergarden, but black men couldnt be kindergarden teachers back then so that plan fell through. Thats the kind of person he is thiugh he\u2019s got acsess to unlimited love in his heart I don\u2019t know how or why but he exists to care for people. He tells us how proud he is of us all the time too these days though he\u2019s run out of words to fully describe his pride. Unfortunately, now my sister and I are all grown up and are wildly sucsessful and independent people so my dad is kinda lost with no one who needs a daddy. Mind you my sister and I call him every day but even if we just end uo talking about skyrim we make him feel like he is still a central part of our lives. Its still hard for him to have no one to look after though. Thankfully my aunt (who is single) recently adoped a little girl so my dad has been like \u201cNOPE! This kid is not growing up without a father\u201d its given him a lot more meaning in life. Now he takes her out on adventures on the weekends and helps her with homework and projects. She facetimes him haphazzardly throuhh out the week and it gives him stories to tell to us older kids. Dad\u2019s whose life goal is to dad are amazing people. They don\u2019t have any expectations for you to be anything but yourself and they only want you to do your best even if your best is the second slowest lap time or straight C\u2019s through computer class. If you\u2019ve done your best you\u2019ve made dad proud. That sense of safety and unconditional love an support is invaluable. Be sure to tell your dad how much he means to you at some point. Its important for him to know that he\u2019s done his job well. And for the moms whose life goal it is to mom keep it up you are important too.

If this is the first time this kind of behavior has turned up, then there's still hope for the relationship - but only if you nip it in the bud and show him right now that you're not going to stand for it. My boyfriend also once had jealousy issues; in his case, they were a little more understandable, since his previous girlfriend was an emotionally abusive monster who cheated on him multiple times and kept him around via a combination of serial lying and convincing him that he was worthless and would never be able to do better than her. (This is not made up, I knew this girl in-person. She's now an unemployed mother-of-two with domestic assault charges. Serious piece of work.) Anyway, all of *that* had some nasty effects on my BF's self esteem and trust in women. He would get uncomfortable when I went out for a meal with male co-workers or even just stayed late at work with my male boss. Rather early in our relationship we had to have a sit-down where I laid out some basic guidelines that went a little like this: 1) I love you. 2) I will always act in consideration of your feelings and I will never hide anything from you, but I will not change my plans, clothes, or behavior to accommodate jealousy, period.  3) You will either get the hell over this or I will get the hell out of here, because if you can't trust me, then you shouldn't be in a relationship with me and vice versa. I did give him some time to sort things out in his head (you can't just demand that someone immediately stop feeling something they are feeling) and offered him reasonable reassurances (I let him know where I was and who I was with whenever he asked, alerted him ahead of time of plans that I was making, comforted him when he was feeling insecure). It wasn't a one-time conversation, nor did I expect it to be, but every following conversation was easier and we've been together almost four years now (friends for a decade before that) and he hasn't exhibited any jealousy since our first year together. As a geeky girl I end up going to lots of events with our mutual male friends, regularly talking with guy friends online in games, and have close friendships with several male co-workers, all without any issues. So, it is possible to deal with a jealous boyfriend and have things turn out well, but you absolutely have to be firm and uncompromising on the issue right from the start. Jealousy is common, but it's not acceptable. Lay down the lines and don't accept his crossing them for any reason. He will not call you trashy/slutty or even imply it. He can know where you are and who you are with, but he can't tell you not to go. He will trust you from a distance, or he will not have you at any distance. \\*hug\\* Good luck girl. <3", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 10257, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 13 23:32:53 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "I can accept that he might feel a moment of jealousy, but to insult your character because you went out one time and dressed in a way that made you feel attractive for the first time in your life?

I was in a (very) long distance relationship for 4 years. Ultimately it didn't work out because of her jealousy. She has a long and very damaging past so I was accepting and tolerant of her jealousy initially. Eventually most of my friends were driven away. Fun fact, most of my friends are women. Jealousy in moderation is fine, as long as the behaviour that comes from it is in order. Boyfriend gets grumpy at seeing you dressed so good and at a place with other people? \"Sorry babe, I needed to do this for me. I've never been as confident and I had such a fun night with my friends\"   -  \"That's okay, I'm just being silly because seeing how good you looked made me want you all to myself that night\".  Vs \"You dressed slutty and trashy. Are you bored of me and looking for somebody else? I don't want you to to do that again, I don't trust you not to leave me for somebody else\" His reaction is totally over the top and way out of order. You took a very big personal step by going to that party and it would have been nice for him to support and encourage you. As jealous as my ex could get, I can honestly say she never stopped me from being in situations that would tick her jealousy boxes. I always communicated with her to make sure she understood where I would be, who I would be with and if she was okay with it. You told him exactly where you were and who you were with. It wasn't until he saw how good you looked that he got insecure. In a way that could be flattering, but to respond the way he did is horrible. You should consider this a flag. It's an extreme response. If it's a one off then cool, he made progress himself by controlling his emotions. If he does anything similar to this again then you can safely assume it's a part of his core behaviour that you haven't experienced only because of not being with him in person. I hope that you don't restrict yourself from doing things that you would enjoy and in which he has no genuine cause for concern, just because of concern of his reaction. That's the start of (not violent) intimate partner abuse and it will just chain into worse and worse scenarios.

I would greatly appreciate any insight or advice on his situation. I have been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend for the past year and a half. We live across the country from one another, so we only see each other once every couple of months. Everything seems to be perfect, and we're planning on closing the gap within the next year or so. For the past year I've been coming out of my shell and trying to gain more confidence in myself. Most of the time I'm quite, a little shy and never go out to parties or clubs. I've always felt isolated and uncomfortable in those situations. Yet, last night I decided to go out with some friends to a dress up party. This is completely out of character of me, but I really wanted to push myself to experience something that I may have been uncomfortable with. My friends and I dressed up and one of my friends (a makeup artist) did my makeup. I know I wasn't wearing the most modest outfit but it was the first time that I actually saw myself as even a little attractive. I felt really good about myself. We went out to the party and met up with other friends. Everyone was so supportive of me as they all know I'm really shy and don't go out. This was the first time I actually had fun at a party. I let go of any feelings of self consciousness and just danced with my friends. As the evening came to a close, I felt super confident, and decided to send a photo of myself to my boyfriend. Sending a photo to him is also out of character for me, but I thought he would appreciate it as it was one of the few times I put effort into how I looked. He often asks for sexy pictures of me, but I struggle sending them to him most of the time. He knew I was at a party, so it wasn't like I was going behind his back or lying to him. Everything was fine, but this morning I woke up to a message that caught me off guard. He all of a sudden started to accuse me of being bored with him and started going on about how I would leave him for someone else in the future. I called him and we talked about it. He said he didn't feel comfortable with me going out to parties as he wouldn't be there to have his eye on me incase something happened with another guy. I told him that I would never cheat on him him. To do something like that would also be a betrayal of my own moral code. He has no reason to suspect me of cheating. I've done nothing to betray his trust, and this was the first time I went out this year. I don't even drink or do any drugs, so it's not like my thinking would be clouded in any way. He then told me he was uncomfortable with they way I dressed and said my make up and clothes at the party were trashy and slutty. My self confidence took a nosedive. I'm now starting to wonder if I've made a huge embarrassment of myself last night or if people were being genuine with their compliments. I told him that his jealousy was unwarranted and that I should be able to go out with my friends if I want to. He made the argument that I'm starting to change and become a party girl, and he knows I'll get together with another guy at a party. He's accusing me of this even though this is the first time this year I have gone out with my friends. I felt really conflicted because although he had hurt me with his comments, I could still see that he was emotionally vulnerable and felt alone and jealous. So I promised him that this was a one off thing and I wouldn't go out again. He said he doesn't believe that I would keep that promise. I really just need some guidance on this situation. Is this normal in a relationship? Is there any way that I could work with him so that we both find a happy medium? I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I'd really like women's perspective on this situation. Thank you so much!Edit: If men want to share their opinions, I would also appreciate it. All insight is valuable.Edit 2: I just wanted to thank everyone who spoke their mind and gave advice.

Has he made you feel badly about yourself before? Is this what a loving partner does?  He messed up here, and you should ask for an apology.  I just want you to think for a little bit about the way that he talks to you.  How often does the conversation turn critical?  Promise him one thing. That you will act in a way that respects yourself and him.

I have been in very similar shoes to what you're going through right now. You didn't make a fool of yourself and right now, the one who is in the wrong is him. From what you've said and from my own experiences, my safest guess is that he is probably insecure. You mentioned it's long distance for you guys so this is likely amplifying any worries or insecurities he has. I see red flags in the things he told you, but that doesn't mean they're impossible to work past.I want to reiterate that you did nothing wrong. Remember that new found confidence and positive feelings you felt at the start of your night and throughout the good time with your friends. Don't lose that feeling, don't let what he said take that from you.

It's rather controlling and can become quite toxic. It's wrong of him to take out whatever his insecurities and worries are on you.

She told me she was afraid that they'd snatch her.She told one of the worst parts of this for her was that this occurred on a very public and crowded street, with many people around her who walked by and did nothing. It took almost five minutes before a passing guy stepped in and intervened. For her though, the worst part of all of this was what she was wearing. At the time she was wearing a blouse, heels, and a knee-length skirt. I told her didn't matter what she was wearing, but she assured me it very much did. She told me that what she was wearing was business attire; the kind of thing that she would wear to a job interview. She said that if wearing professional clothing on a crowded street in broad daylight was cause for one of the scariest moments of her life, she wasn't sure how she could feel comfortable walking to a job interview.I want to be as supportive as I possibly can, but I also want to be more of an advocate for stopping sexual violence.

Because of the way men are conditioned to be \"strong\" they end up never opening up to anyone except their significant other, and the primary way they feel closeness is with sex. However, while libido will always be a factor, if men can get that closeness with friends-then they won't be so hyper focused on sex. Which is often an obsession that approaches disordered levels in our society.4) Make healthier porn options that model some of the things we want to see in society. I'm not saying all the kinky porn needs to go away (but it might, more research is always needed) but there are newer feminist porn models that focus on consent. 5) Stop the cycle of abuse: Most of the people who are abusive were either abused, or raised near abuse. Education can help, but also making sure all kids have access to good quality mental healthcare.6) Part of this needs to go into fixing expressions of masculinity, and reducing our cultural elements that harbor dangerous expressions of narcissism (everyone is a little narcissistic, but extreme forms are where the danger comes from), people need to feel comfortable apologizing sincerely for the abuses they cause others-- and importantly, following through with those apologies with tangible actions that give the victims control over their story -- This is a public example, but since the story would be the possession of the victim, not all examples will be so public: https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/rape-survivor-book-ted-talk7) We also need to learn how to care about everyone (specifically all children, and all victims) more. I've seen a lot of examples where showing empathy toward someone upfront helps to reduce their risky behavior, even if they're already engaging in problem behavior. This spans all the non-profit focuses, homelessness (housing first programs have the best success rate), drug and alcohol abuse, victims of abuse, victims of the foster care system, and so on. If you improve your compassion for the homeless, you're going to help them have more compassion for themselves, which, will help them have more compassion for others. (it doesn't work for everyone, but it works for most people)8) And lastly, using all of the above to help guide us: Fix the criminal justice system: We need to be better at convicting people that commit the crimes, testing rape kits (they catch serial rapists better than anything), and providing rehabilitation and reintegration services for non-serial rapists.  9) ETA: Oh, and taking guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, and making sure we have better protections for people who are being stalked and abused. Violent people often escalate, we need to stop saying \"there's nothing we can do\" and start doing something.

My opinion, personally, is that it's the opposite of the gun problem, where we can't take the harm out of the trouble maker's hands, so we have to fight against it. The obvious problem is the biological difference between men and women, but there's the underlying problem that women (again, I might seem insensitive, but what I mean is most women I encounter, all y'all ladies are unique and different) seem to be too aware of that difference. and I feel like that's starting to fade away. we hear more and more stories of women that defend themselves successfully from rapists and I think that's awesome, but that should be the norm. I don't quite know where I'm going with this, so this is sort of the point where I want to hear your opinion, but I think, personally, that there's something that has to change, because seeing stories like these break my heart, especially since I literally don't know how she could avoided the 2 additional rapes after the first one (without wanting to victim blame, she PROBABLY(which it sucks I have to put emphasis on) would have been safe in a cab, but my point in this very long post is that it sucks absolute shit that she can't fucking walk down the street safely)put shortly, I think (at least at this point in time) that while it is totally their fault, prevention on these fuckers would be difficult to enforce, because no normal human being attacks anyone going down the street, period. the fact it's rape makes it worst, but preventing those attacks is just as hard as preventing people from randomly throwing a right hook at a defenseless old man on the street. so we'd have to change the idea that women are powerless, or I don't know what but I feel like some of the women I speak put limits on themselves because they're women, even if it's just while throwing a football or play fighting.FINAL WORD: please limit the hate. any (if at all) offense you may perceive comes from misinformation and carelessness from my part, I swear I come here with nothing more than a desire for conversation. I don't want IN ANY WAY to diminish how bad rape is, I don't want IN ANY WAY to victim blame, and I'm not trying to do any other thing that might bring you any rage, anger or sadness. I come here to be educated and start a discussion. and so, let us open this horrible can of worms.EDIT: I just want to say, I'm really glad with how this post is turning out. I used to feel like this subreddit jumped to conclusions fast and was hard to have a decent conversation with, but my ideas have changed.

Would love suggestions on dealing with this.Last summer I completed a research internship at another university and worked with another undergrad intern (call this guy B). He was not numerically documenting results from trials or coming up with a logical course of action for future ones. Instead, I was left to do that and had to run so many trials on my own, which ended up being more than him. Even though I was paid for 40 hours per week, I was actually putting in 50 and sometimes 60 to get them done. There were also several times where he did not attend group meetings for the entire lab even though it was expected of everyone.Fast forward a couple months and yet another student in the lab (not an intern but a normal student worker, whi we will call C) picked up the project and submitted an abstract to a conference. The PI of the lab sent me an email asking if I wanted to go along. I personally could not attend the conference due to conflicts with other things (i.e. my home department is getting reaccredited and the head wants me to talk with the auditors.) C asked if he could include me as an author, and I said yes. (EDIT: I did not say to include me without this question as originally implied. It was bizzarre that he asked, as authorship is usually implied.)We both knew this guy, and I at least thought he noticed how much longer I was in the lab. However, he included me as the second author and the other intern B as the first author. (For those of you not familiar with research, the order in which authors are cited is an indicator of how much each contributed. First author usually goes to the most active author and it goes down from there, but last author is usually reserved for the PI or other senior researcher.) So the order ended us as B, myself, and C. For some reason, the PI was not cited.I am honestly at a loss on dealing with this because I wasn't there to decide the order for citing us. It could have just been that he did it randomly, but it could have also been formally decided. It could have also been that the PI told him to use that order even though she previously advocated for me. Since this is unfortunately something that is likely to keep happening in my career, I would like advice on dealing with it.EDIT: I clarified some things about the situation since they were initially vague and made it sound like a different problem.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "762h91", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "I did more work than a male coworker and he is getting cited ahead of me - help?", "num_comments": 9, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 54, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/762h91/i_did_more_work_than_a_male_coworker_and_he_is/", "submission_time": "Fri Oct 13 08:29:52 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "The very fact that someone else can usurp credit for something you\u2019ve done should tell you a lot about the nature of credit.

He lives about a two hour drive away but comes to my city often for meetings so our relationship has mostly been sexy texting. But apart from racy texts, we also talk about life, our careers, our dating experiences, and we have been totally open with one another about desires, fantasies, past experiences, etc. We swap stories and have a completely open line of communication. We were able to coordinate schedules when he was coming to town once a few months ago and finally met in person. We fooled around quite a bit and did everything besides actual intercourse.Last night he was in town again and I happened to be free, so I invited him over. We have lots in common besides sex so we talked for a long time, had wine, made dinner, lots of chit chat, and then things started to heat up a little.Just as things were about to cross into X-rated territory, he reached for his phone and said he wanted to show me something, I think it was a photo. He unlocked the screen and I just about had a heart attack. The app for voice memos (or audio recording) was open and running. He hit the home button quickly and the app minimized, but the red flashing banner at the top of the screen persisted. It just so happened that, a week ago, I had to record a work meeting, so I knew exactly what I was seeing.I pulled back and put a large distance between us on the couch.\"I can't continue after what I've just seen,\" I said. \"I'm very taken aback.\"He played dumb. I explained that I'd seen the audio recording app running and he tripped over his words saying he had no idea what I was talking about, even tried saying his hand was sweaty and maybe he'd opened the app by accident. Oh yeah sure, and hit record as well, oops! /sI demanded he open the app and show me, and he did. There it was. An audio recording with today's date, that had been running for OVER AN HOUR. I made him delete it. I told him I wasn't stupid and that I couldn't ignore a red flag of this magnitude.For a solid five minutes he denied it was intentional. I told him I needed to think, because I didn't want to toss around false accusations. As uncomfortable as it was, I sat there and explained to him that this was a massive red flag and that my gut was screaming at me that my interpretation was correct - that he was hoping to catch some salacious audio that he could enjoy again later. I told him I was completely turned off and that the evening was done, as I couldn't bounce back from this, regardless of his denial and crappy explanation. In the past, my low self esteem would have made me accept his explanation and try desperately to salvage the evening. But not anymore. This time I stood up for myself. It was weird and awkward because I wasn't giving in or letting it go. I decided to let it be weird. He deserved to squirm and feel the embarrassment and not have it glossed over. I could not continue with this person and be able to live with myself after.After a few minutes, he caved and admitted he'd been recording. He gave me some bullshit story about being worried about consent, he blamed the wine, he berated himself. He maintained that he'd forgotten he had pressed record and had only meant to do it for a moment or two. But come on, there was no specific moment of consent that he could have captured. At no point did he ask me \"is it okay if I touch you?\" Nothing like that. Our consent has been talked about at length, and was ongoing, even during the course of the evening. He was not trying to capture one little snippet of audio. It was a hail mary of an excuse meant to twist this into him being a good guy. I reminded him how open our conversations had always been, and that he knew me quite well and that the implication that I would falsely accuse him of something and that he would need evidence was downright offensive.He begged for forgiveness, said he would have noticed the recording hours later and deleted it. YEAH FUCKING RIGHT. We were literally seconds away from creating some very juicy audio that I'm sure he would have kept. I am SO glad for the timing. I hadn't even touched him yet and the timing of him looking at his phone right at that moment made it so that I don't have anything to regret today. He didn't successful achieve any sexual contact with me. But it was *sooo* close!The worst part? He had downed three quarters of a bottle of wine and was not in a position to drive. All I could think in the moment was that I was legally responsible if he was driving drunk and killed someone. So I felt like I couldn't let him leave right away. Otherwise I would have escorted him straight to the door. So I had to spend the next hour sitting there, handing him glasses of water, and consoling this fucker as he beat himself up over his behavior. A stronger woman may have done differently, but I was alone with a rejected blue-balled man sitting on my couch, and I had to weigh the risk of telling him to GTFO and potentially causing an unpleasant scene, or keep things going smoothly and downplaying my rage until he was ready to drive.Even after he was busted, this idiot was talking about \"next time we hang out\" as if we had a future of any kind. The nerve. I suppose I'm a good enough actress that I made him think things were okay. Eventually I just stood up and whisked him to the door and told him to text me when he got home to let me know he'd made it okay. More concern than he deserved from me, but again, I was concerned about the legal ramifications. He made it home and sent me a confirmation text. I won't be responding, and I will never agree to see him again. The lesson here, sisters, is to trust your instincts. If something doesn't feel right, trust that feeling. You don't even need to rationalize it. I realize what he was doing was REALLY obvious, but I have a history of men gaslighting me, lying to me and calling me crazy for accusing them of lies (and me believing them and doubting myself) and a lifetime of society pushing me to defer to the man's feelings and to be pleasant. As I sat there processing what was happening I knew it could go two ways - I could accept his flimsy explanation and apology and continue fooling around (and then hate myself for it) or I could put a stop to this and call him out. When called out, he denied. But I persisted. And I'm so glad I did, because I was right. Looking back at my own past relationships, I can see now that I was right A LOT, but not strong enough to know it then, and I let bad men walk all over me.I feel proud of myself that I am strong enough now and will be taking this lesson into my future interactions with men.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "764k5e", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "My FWB crossed a line and I learned to trust my instincts", "num_comments": 27, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 2068, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/764k5e/my_fwb_crossed_a_line_and_i_learned_to_trust_my/", "submission_time": "Fri Oct 13 16:51:26 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Sounds like he was trying to protect himself.

Those people are extremely racist, homphobic, violent loud and absolutely awful. They support putting Muslims into extermination camps (I.E Holocaust). Also, might i add, hated by everyone who isn't in those circles, including politicians but especially the general public who really does just want's to live in peace. I suppose you can compare it to extremely radical muslims, if there were no severe consequences, those people would go out and stab and shoot and kill Muslims just because they're Muslims. The government absolutely does condemn this behavior. Politicians publicly say that those groups are awful. You don't go to jail for saying stuff like that, but if you actively go out and riot or hurt other people there will be consequences. Another edit for something I saw in the comments that really bothered me:Holy shit guys, no one is shooting live ammo at Palestinian rioters.

Aside from the common answer that Trump did this as (another) anti-Obama move, what is the logic behind this?I have read putin supported this, the EU, leading nuclear professors from Ivy League and internationally acclaimed universities have signed petitions for Obama to get on board with this. So what is the rationale to back out? E- thanks for all the replies folks! I guess another big gap I'm struggling with is that trump kept insisting that \"congress make changes ... in a very short period of time\". What changes ? That's very vague for everyone. What was his objective for congress ? Why was this deal bad for the US with the existing language and what changes did he want? Recent history has told me not to trust trump, but I haven't really understood why I shouldn't trust him on this issue. E2- special thanks to /u/contantofaz, for enlightening me that we cannot have this conversation without mentioning Israel. My understanding is that out of all of our allies, the one we may have soured relationships the most with during the eight Obama years was Israel. Trump indicates he's a businessman often that \"scratches your back if you scratch his\". Israel was frustrated with Obama, so its fair to assume that Israel and Trump get along well. 24 hours ago we pulled out of UNESCO, a gesture that certainly appeased Israel. Regardless of the reasons why, this move to withdraw from the Iran deal will appease Israel too. My hypothesis is that trump has existing relations or opportunities with Israel and that last 48 hours feeds my confirmation bias.  The explanation is still vague, but slightly clearer now that I understand that Israel is intimate involved here.

Both for international leverage as well as establishing themselves as #1 military force in the Middle East.     Iran tested a ballistic missile in September.  That is a crucial component for nuclear weapons.  It's a sign that they are likely still pursuing their nuclear ambitions as much as they can while still keeping the sanctions at bay.  The US would have to be naive to think that the current deal is preventing Iran from accomplishing it's nuclear goals.  It's only delaying it.  We delayed it with stuxnet, we delayed it with sanctions, we delayed it with deals.  But progress continues to move forward. Research continues. They can even just say fuck it and start trading for North Korean nuclear weapons any time they want.    This idea of sanctions to prevent nuclear proliferation is not working.

What's needed is immense and sustained 'research for research's sake\" sponsored either by private interests or by governments.

Before the advent of the antibiotic era we had precious little we could do to combat bacterial infections, and thus commensal friendly bacteria would evolve ways to spread to other human hosts faster by making us sick and there wasn't really much at all we could do about it. The big obvious thing that antibiotics did was allow us to treat sick people with miraculous efficacy, but perhaps the even bigger though less obvious thing they did was to shape the evolution of the microbes associated with us. Quite suddenly, evolving ways to make their human hosts sick was no longer a successful strategy for bacteria as it would just make them a bigger target for doctors to apply antibiotics to. Within just a few short years whole lineages of bacteria associated with us, the genetic elements that made them pathogenic, and the virulence strategies they used functionally went extinct.What is making superbugs 'super' isn't the antibiotic resistance itself, if anything that resistance often comes with a mild to severe fitness cost, its that beautiful evolutionary dynamic falling apart. We no longer have a way to control the evolution of significantly resistant bugs, and so they are rapidly evolving back into those old strategies that were so viscerally terrifying. To abuse a phrase from Jonathan Edwards, this whole time over the last 60 years we have been but sneezing into the hands of an angry God. Damnation didn\u2019t slumber, the pit of those ecological niches was always prepared, the fire of their pathogenicity islands made ready, the furnace hot, ready to receive us, and the flames do now rage and glow. So really what makes those bugs super isn't new at all, just something that we've happily forgotten and will slowly return. All antibiotics have done is given us a glorious window in which our parents and ourselves could enjoy a world without epidemic bacterial disease - and hopefully give us the strength to figure out something to do next.I'm a molecular biologist working on understanding bacteriophages well enough that they could, hopefully, be that next thing in addition to their current role as specialty antimicrobial agents for various contexts where antibiotics cant be used. They have been used for antimicrobial purposes in the Former Soviet Union now as part of the standard of care for close to a hundred years, and are now being used across the US and Europe on a compassionate use basis - particularly in military medicine.

Allowing large businesses to intentionally drag their heels on this utterly vital issue has brought us to the brink of a new medical dark age. It's very simple: *we are running out of medicine and nobody wants to make more*.

Before the advent of the antibiotic era we had precious little we could do to combat bacterial infections, and thus commensal friendly bacteria would evolve ways to spread to other human hosts faster by making us sick and there wasn't really much at all we could do about it. The big obvious thing that antibiotics did was allow us to treat sick people with miraculous efficacy, but perhaps the even bigger though less obvious thing they did was to shape the evolution of the microbes associated with us. Quite suddenly, evolving ways to make their human hosts sick was no longer a successful strategy for bacteria as it would just make them a bigger target for doctors to apply antibiotics to. Within just a few short years whole lineages of bacteria associated with us, the genetic elements that made them pathogenic, and the virulence strategies they used functionally went extinct.What is making superbugs 'super' isn't the antibiotic resistance itself, if anything that resistance often comes with a mild to severe fitness cost, its that beautiful evolutionary dynamic falling apart. We no longer have a way to control the evolution of significantly resistant bugs, and so they are rapidly evolving back into those old strategies that were so viscerally terrifying. To abuse a phrase from Jonathan Edwards, this whole time over the last 60 years we have been but sneezing into the hands of an angry God. Damnation didn\u2019t slumber, the pit of those ecological niches was always prepared, the fire of their pathogenicity islands made ready, the furnace hot, ready to receive us, and the flames do now rage and glow. So really what makes those bugs super isn't new at all, just something that we've happily forgotten and will slowly return. All antibiotics have done is given us a glorious window in which our parents and ourselves could enjoy a world without epidemic bacterial disease - and hopefully give us the strength to figure out something to do next.I'm a molecular biologist working on understanding bacteriophages well enough that they could, hopefully, be that next thing in addition to their current role as specialty antimicrobial agents for various contexts where antibiotics cant be used. They have been used for antimicrobial purposes in the Former Soviet Union now as part of the standard of care for close to a hundred years, and are now being used across the US and Europe on a compassionate use basis - particularly in military medicine.

I have direct experience.Many, many countries have EXTREMELY strict laws about dispensing opiates.  So strict, the doctors are terrified to dispense them. Take Russia (and all FSU countries, really).  I worked with Russian doctors who were issued morphine for emergency.  10mg ampules.  The standard dose? 10mg.  Because to waste any unused morphine had to be done in front of a police officer. Here in the US, we typically do it with any witness, such as a nurse, doctor, EMT, etc.  The only accounting is the patient chart, which are audited by pharmacists.  I have personally had to, well, lets just say \"use vigorous verbal encouragement\" to get a Russian doctor to give a patient having a heart attack morphine.  There is an excellent article somewhere on the internet of a guy who basically runs an illegal pharmacy service for cancer and pain patients in Russia, where he obtains the meds by legal and illegal means (often, I believe, mailed to him from donors out of country whose family member has passed on).  He is a hero.My mother in law developed lung cancer in a FSU country.  Her last days, she received only IM toradol (a good painkiller, but non narcotic. Think super-ibuprofen).  She died in extreme pain.  I had taken her to the UAE for treatment at one point, and asked the oncologist, a Finnish gentleman, about the issue of pain medicine for cancer patients.  He said it wasn't too bad for him personally, because he had a good relationship with the Ministry of Health.  But, still, these are medications that are normally only given in a hospital.  Chronic pain sufferers should be aware to NEVER travel to a Muslim country unless they have all the right documentation for their pain medicine.  Bringing your oxycontin into UAE or Malaysia without the governments approval (and getting that often requires, -NO SHIT- a letter from the US Secretary of State, as well as a mound of other paperwork) can land you in prison, possibly even a death sentence.  A prescription is worthless.  I worked on a ship and we had a sailor break his leg in one of the above mentioned countries.  I took him to a hospital to get an x ray and a backslab put on.  The doctors refused to give anything because \"the pharmacy was closed.\"  I told the doc I had some tylenol with codeine from the ship's supply (all countries allow this, as part of international maritime treaty law.  Don't even THINK of taking it off the ship though, and good luck getting it resupplied outside of the US, Europe, Singapore and a few other countries).  The local doc just said, \"Better that you keep giving him that.\"  I could tell he was relieved.  He didn't want to deal with issuing a narcotic script in his draconian medical system.  For a badly fractured leg.TL;dr- In most of the world, the doctors are so afraid of running afoul of the narcotics laws, they refuse to give them out.  Nor is the US without its own issues.  There are doctors around who still believe \"dont give pain meds for abdominal pain\" because it will \"mask symptoms\".   Virtually every hospital is guilty of oligoanalgesia (not enough pain relief).  It happens literally everywhere, all the time.  Often the fear is suppression of breathing /overdose.  So they give orders for small doses every few hours.  This happened to me recently, after surgery.  I was getting .2mg of dilaudid about every 4 hours.  It barely took the edge off.  Then my pain went to 10/10.  I thought it might be gas (common after laproscopic surgery).  The nurse tried simethicone, suppository, but I was in so much pain I couldnt even get out of bed to use the toilet.  I finally told her \"Look, .2 is not enough.  I weigh 120kg.  You need to give me 1mg.  Call for an order.\"  She did (she was a good nurse).   The doctor said she could give .5mg.  It helped, but not as much as 1mg would have.  Turned out the pain was coming from my drain (next morning they removed the drain, which stopped the pain, but it was an agonizing 12 hours).  Note: THIS WAS AT A HOSPITAL RATED NO. 1 IN THE WORLD.Having worked as a flight medic, I have given literally GALLONS of pain meds over my career.  If you want good pain relief, call a paramedic.  We aren't worried about ODing the patient, because we literally are sitting right next to them every second, and watching them.  We mix up fentanyl drips (the Holy Grail of pain relief) and up the dose until we get the patient comfortable.  Yet doctors are worried that nurses, despite all the monitoring equipment available, will OD the patient. I should have been given a PCA pump and placed on a continuous vital sign monitor, but because I have mild sleep apnea, I had to make my nurse keep pestering the doctor for pain orders.  My father was in the hospital for surgery for pancreatic cancer.  My mother said he was in intense pain.  I got the ICU intensivist on the phone (was out of state).  I said, \"Look, he's a 300 pound man with diabetic neuropathy.  How much pain medication are you giving him?\" She said something like 5mg of morphine every few hours.  I told her \"He takes 30mg of oral morphine a DAY.  Think about that.  He's obviously got a tolerance.  You need to up his dose considerably.\"  She said she hadnt realized that and would do so.  Side note: Every patient in a hospital needs an advocate, even if its only the patient themselves.  My son had an appendectomy and was having a lot of post surgical pain.  I told the nurse in no uncertain terms I wanted an increase in his morphine order.  She was, luckily, an ex-flight nurse, so we were totally on the same page, but she had to fight for it.  The doctors were very reluctant.  Yes, they have reasons: decreased motility, respiratory depression, etc.  But these are ALL treatable.  Patients need to be aware it is an ethical violation to withhold sufficient pain medication.  If you or a family member are in a hospital, and not getting sufficient pain medicine after reasonable requests, DEMAND to see the hospital's patient advocate or patient rights representative, or someone on the ethics committee.
