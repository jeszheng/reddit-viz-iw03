Many are pointing out that the photo doesn't actually show him touching her, and that it is obvious it is meant to be a joke though in poor taste. There are also others pointing out that this is a conservative radio host who appears to be a tea party supporter and thus a motive to exaggerate. The obvious issue - are people really willing to approach accusations like this with the worldview that false accusations don't happen? It obviously seems (and feels) SO hypocritical to question an accuser after everything that has gone on with Moore, but it should be acknowledged that false accusations do happen. Most studies place that number in the 5-10% range - one out of every ten or twenty being false. I would imagine that number goes up for celebrities and politicians. Does that matter? Does it not? I don't know what the right answer is, but I do think it is a good discussion to have and this will provoke that discussion.(Disclaimer: I made this edit when this post had approximately 2200 points.

Let's start with the kissing. According to her own statement, Franken had her verbal permission to kiss her. Was he too pushy and aggressive from her account? Absolutely, but not to the degree that this was sexual assault or illegal. This isn't a case of a boss and subordinate where she was coerced into giving that permission. And he stopped after she told him to stop.The groping claim seems like a complete joke. She states the only basis for the groping claim is the photo (she was asleep), but he's not touching her in the photo. Maybe his finger tips are grazing her thick flack jacket. That's not groping. It is definitely in very poor taste but she's not accusing him of making a joke in bad taste.This whole story is completely overblown, and I fear that Franken will have his career ruined because liberals are so desperate to demonstrate that they aren't like the Republicans sticking up for Moore and Trump.

The one time he actually asked them for something, they ignored him.He responded to them twice: Once, when they asked him for comment on the website, he said he'd ask around, but he never got back to them.  The second time was right before the October leaks, when he asked what was behind them, and they never got back to him.  After that they continued to try to milk him for information, and he never responded again.Seriously, look through my comment history prior to Monday, I was 100% on board the Trump-Russia hype train.  But the DMs pretty much prove there was no collusion.  In the DMs, Wikileaks expressly says they are **not** pro-Russia (which I don't believe, but it's what they say), and in fact they are asking Jr for damaging information on Trump that they can leak.  It actually does appear they are working both sides and just trying to get shit to leak to promote their own image.  Also in the DMs, Jr asks them what is behind the upcoming leak, pretty much proving he was *not* involved in any quid pro quo \"release the emails and we'll lessen sanctions\" deal.  If he was, why the hell would he be asking what the upcoming leak would be?  He would know, because he arranged it in that June meeting.[READ THE ACTUAL DMS](https://i.imgur.com/lFp7DJb.png).  This story is bullshit and it turns out the whole Trump-Russia thing may be bullshit.  At this point I think Manafort and Stone were using Trump by promising Russians they would influence him.  If you read the actual dossier, it says the Trumps were *glad* the media was focusing on Russia because it would detract from China (where the Trumps had actually committed crimes).  Trump was OK with Mueller until the NYT asked Trump about Mueller investigating financial crimes, at which point Trump was like 'Um no this goes to far, it's supposed to be about Russia.'  Trump asked Comey to \"let go of the Flynn thing\"... which dealt with Turkey.  **Trump wants us all focused on Russia because he's innocent of that.**Russia certainly meddled in our elections and the Trumps are certainly guilty of crimes, but I am becoming more and more certain that the Trump-Russia investigation **is** a witchhunt, and when it all ends there will be no collusion between Trump himself and Russia (though possibly Manafort and Russia or pro-Russia Ukrainian forces).  I'm also certain Mueller isn't fooled by articles like this and is looking where the evidence actually leads.

By making it more expensive to get a Ph.D. in sciences and engineering many potential students from low and middle classes will be weeded out. Only students with a rich mommy and daddy that help them financially during their years of study will earn those degrees. This will lead to more Republican scientists and engineers (assuming that those with rich parents are more likely to be Republican). That is one way to influence what scientists study and what they discover. The relative earning power of low skill, low education jobs has been miserable for years, but Ph.D.s in science and engineering often make bank. So by skewing the incoming students towards the rich, this bill could reward rich people by thinning out the competition. More people from poor and middle class backgrounds will have to forego science and engineering degrees, and settle for lower wage jobs. That will allow the rich students easier access (due to less competition) to those high paying jobs. Essentially, this bill will reduce the ability of the poor and middle class to move up in terms of economic class. It will effectively reduce financial mobility, and help maintain families within a given financial class across multiple generations.Second (and less cynical) view: this bill could reduce the total number of students who apply for and earn Ph.D.s in science and engineering (as well as other fields). The number of job openings for those with STEM Ph.D.s is not great, and many Ph.D.s fail to get tenure track positions in their field. Seen in this way, the bill could lead to an adjustment in which the number of graduates better matches the number of openings. Of course, there is still the problem that not all students would be affected equally by this bill.

This does a disservice to the victims of abuse - as they will be more quickly and easily written off as sensationalist political hacks (which I think is what Stone desires).  Stone's involvement and the timeframe in which these allegations were released (so closely following the release of the Roy Moore allegations) leads me to believe that this could be an intended goal, especially as a defender of Trump.  Stone has to see that it won't take much for the national discussion to jump from Moore's accuser's to Trump's.

Nobody will believe the analysis if it goes against what they want to believe and understandably so.In this case there is no reason to say his visits were not successful because the foreign policy is yet to be seen.

There's more I want to say, but the first and most important thing\u2014and if it's the only thing you care to hear, that's fine\u2014is: I'm sorry.\u201cI respect women. I don't respect men who don't. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.\u201cBut I want to say something else, too. Over the last few months, all of us\u2014including and especially men who respect women\u2014have been forced to take a good, hard look at our own actions and think (perhaps, shamefully, for the first time) about how those actions have affected women.\u201cFor instance, that picture. I don't know what was in my head when I took that picture, and it doesn't matter. There's no excuse. I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn't funny. It's completely inappropriate. It's obvious how Leeann would feel violated by that picture. And, what's more, I can see how millions of other women would feel violated by it\u2014women who have had similar experiences in their own lives, women who fear having those experiences, women who look up to me, women who have counted on me.\u201cComing from the world of comedy, I've told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive. But the intentions behind my actions aren't the point at all. It's the impact these jokes had on others that matters. And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to come to terms with that.\u201cWhile I don't remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women\u2019s experiences.\u201cI am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate.\u201cAnd the truth is, what people think of me in light of this is far less important than what people think of women who continue to come forward to tell their stories.

They aren't trying to bury it, at least yet.Both sides have their demons, their assholes, their disgusting people. That will never change, no side will be perfect.

This behavior, groping and so on, was tolerated for way too long. Women always hated it, but often times when standing up to men in power at best you got a shrug and nobody believed you but at worst your career was ruined. Justice was rare, as many of these men did these things at a time it really wasn't considered a big deal by other men in power. A harassed woman basically had to bring her case to other men who rarely sympathized so speaking up was futile and came at huge risk. Now, it is a big deal, and for good reason. This very well maybe a big deal due to a couple of generations of women gaining power in the system. I hope it's teaching young men that groping, cat calling, and other forms of harassment are not OK and can't be tolerated.

This pipeline was created in 2010 as part of Phase 1  Phase 4 is Keystone XL and is still being debated.The Keystone Pipeline (Phase I), delivering oil from Hardisty, Alberta, over 3,456 kilometres (2,147 mi) to the junction at Steele City, Nebraska, and on to Wood River Refinery in Roxana, Illinois, and Patoka Oil Terminal Hub (tank farm) north of Patoka, Illinois, completed in June 2010.The Keystone-Cushing extension (Phase II), running 468 kilometres (291 mi) from Steele City to storage and distribution facilities (tank farm) at Cushing, Oklahoma completed in February 2011.The Gulf Coast Extension (Phase III), running 784 kilometres (487 mi) from Cushing to refineries at Port Arthur, Texas was completed in January 2014 and a lateral pipeline to refineries at Houston, Texas and a terminal will be completed mid-2016, going online the following year.All of these straight from the wikipage. The spill is bad and shines a spotlight on why people don't want the pipeline. Hopefully, it will do something to sway some voters.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 423, "comment_id": "dpxjura", "score": 45, "submission_time": "Fri Nov 17 01:57:02 2017", "ups": 45}, {"body": "795,000 Liters = 210,015 gallons for the metricly disadvantaged.
