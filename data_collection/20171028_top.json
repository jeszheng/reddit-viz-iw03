What will the process for distributing funds to homeowners look like-will grants be based on the value of the home, or the amount of damage leveled? Will HUD allow homeowners with mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration to suspend their mortgage payments while they rebuild?

One was the unit that Sgt. Johnson was a part of, a redirected 12-man Green Beret unit from the US and a 30-man team from Niger, who were doing reconnaissance and community outreach patrol. They were diverted to help a second, coalition unit who was on a \"kill or capture\" mission to intercept high-value target \"Naylor Road\". The small team was purposefully diverted to an abandoned camp, told to burn it, then re-diverted back to the village of Tongo Tongo by the Mali border, where they remained for several hours, despite misgivings (ABC). They were ambushed at midday as they left the village. For some reason, initial \"calls for help\" were ignored for an hour, when a \"call for help\" from the commander was acknowledged, and an unarmed Reaper drone was diverted from the second coalition unit to give IRS. However, despite obvious signs that the unit was losing (the entire flank group appears to have either died or been seriously wounded) no help arrived for an hour, when French Mirage jets buzzed the area but did not engage. In the late evening, according to NBC and CNN, French Super Puma helicopters (and potentially a civilian helicopter from Berry Aviation) arrived from either Mali, Niamby, or Burkina Faso (this is unclear). They were carrying 1-2 Green Berets each. The dead and wounded, sans Sgt. Johnson, were evacuated at this time. It was dark when the helicopters left and the White House was notified that Sgt. Johnson was missing. However, despite multiple Green Beret units being called to Niamby and a SEAL unit called to Germany, no Americans were left on the field when Sgt. Johnson's body was found a mile away 48 hours later. Were the American units diverted by order of Washington, because the White House prioritized the \"kill or capture\" of Naylor Road above the rescue of an American soldier? Did \"no man left behind\" become \"no man left behind, unless we have something better to do\"? Did the Americans leave the small unit out as bait to draw out the ISIS fighters, so that they could isolate Naylor Road, and then left it up to the coalition to clean up their mess? Why is the White House and the Pentagon still trying to cover this up?  Is it because Sgt. Johnson was captured by ISIS and they have video, or is it because he was left by the Americans because they prioritized Donald Trump's need to \"win\" over the life of their soldier?

I have waited over a year with 0 feedback, and told I can't get any info. My loan servicer recently extended my forbearance, so it seems to still be ongoing.I was promised a job in game design. I was told there was a 95% placement rate. I was told I would get a well paying job and ITT would help me find one. None of that happened. I did not find a job in the game design. ITT did not help me find one.ITT took my money. Instead of Semesters there were quarters, year round, so that they could milk money. Each quarter the max was charged for each class. I eventually got a phone call, saying that I ran out of federal funds and would have to take out loans through Sallie Mae at 13.8% interest. They managed to 'find' another quarters worth of credits to transfer in. I 'graduated' with a 4.0 valedictorian and perfect attendance every single quarter. I worked my ass off. I am not an idiot by any stretch (My original major was Bio/Pre-vet at a major state school). Others have said in this thread \"Just pay it back\" Well I wish I could.In all honesty, I don't want to ask for forgiveness. I want to have a decent, well paying job that allows me to pay back my loans. I want to get a new degree, something actually valuable. But I can't because ITT ate up all my federal money. Until ITT told me, I had no idea there was a lifetime aggregate cap on student loans.Now, if I went to grad school, that would unlock a new bit of funding. But not a single school will take my degree for grad school. I have to start over. But I can't. Because I can't go to school at these current prices.I have more evidence that I won't really go into here, but I was Defrauded by my school. Not everyone knows they are being defrauded at the time. When you are in the thick of things, being pressured to continue a half finished degree, excited to advance a career and make something of yourself, you don't realize that those bootstraps are only painted on, and not something that you can actually pull yourself up by.I graduated nearly 10 years ago. I still can't afford to pay all my loans at the rate they (Navient/Great Lakes) want me to. I simply can't afford $600 a month in loans (I have friends that owe $1000+ a month, so I am considered 'lucky') even after being in my current job for 9.5 years. It has only really been with the rise of MOOCs that I have realized that there is a way out of my situation. I have worked hard to make inroads and connections and it is paying dividends (a lot of connections and now some attention from recruiters) but it is still a waiting game until they can find me something in my area that pays what I need.Also, here is also another FU. From what I understand/read/been told, IF you get forgiveness, that is taxable income that you are suddently on the hook for.So, what I envision is this:I get a partial forgiveness, not enough to let me get a real degree elsewhere, but enough to trigger a tax liability that I can't afford, and end up in an even worse situation.

It's a real grievance for me right now as I try to put my content out there. In my opinion the creators really really get shafted by the internet giants, but they think too low of themselves to fight back.  It is often said the GAFA giants live off of our personal data. Sure, but it's underappreciated that they just take all content from creators - each of which by itself could probably not make much money off the net. But then Facebook get's a hundred million creators on, and makes ten bucks off of them - well, that's a billion in profit. By now one has little choice whether to use fb or not - well, that's when they start essentially locking your pages down, unless you pay up. Even if you share links on your personal page, the AI notices if you ask users to buy something or support you - and limit the sharing.  Instagram is the current place to flee to for visual artists, I've heard it from some of the top people that they like it because it allows free shilling for your own products. And it doesn't silo off the creators yet. But it seems delusional to think that will last. It's the same fricking company.  Google btw. profits similarly - at some point they decided to take all my paintings in full resolution into their image search results. On that day I lost 60% of my visitors - that google can no show ads to instead of them seeing my page with my sales pitch.  I'm trying the Reddit profiles right now, in the hope that Reddit will treat creators with more respect as they did so far. But who knows - it's the same system still.

It's a real grievance for me right now as I try to put my content out there. In my opinion the creators really really get shafted by the internet giants, but they think too low of themselves to fight back.  It is often said the GAFA giants live off of our personal data. Sure, but it's underappreciated that they just take all content from creators - each of which by itself could probably not make much money off the net. But then Facebook get's a hundred million creators on, and makes ten bucks off of them - well, that's a billion in profit. By now one has little choice whether to use fb or not - well, that's when they start essentially locking your pages down, unless you pay up. Even if you share links on your personal page, the AI notices if you ask users to buy something or support you - and limit the sharing.  Instagram is the current place to flee to for visual artists, I've heard it from some of the top people that they like it because it allows free shilling for your own products. And it doesn't silo off the creators yet. But it seems delusional to think that will last. It's the same fricking company.  Google btw. profits similarly - at some point they decided to take all my paintings in full resolution into their image search results. On that day I lost 60% of my visitors - that google can no show ads to instead of them seeing my page with my sales pitch.  I'm trying the Reddit profiles right now, in the hope that Reddit will treat creators with more respect as they did so far. But who knows - it's the same system still.

This isn\u2019t a thinly veiled attempt of xenophobia. It\u2019s a few steps removed that. Let me explain. Several years ago the conservative governor of the state de-regulated education by offering voucher to let kids choose private schools. This made private schools more attractive option for many, and as a result public schools now have to compete a lot more, meaning they have to be seen as a \u201cbetter\u201d school. What is a  \u201cbetter\u201d school? Alumni going to good colleges and finding better jobs, that\u2019s what. The pressure for schools are very high because if your school are deemed failing for 3 consecutive years, the school is subject to the state intervention.So what\u2019s happening apparently in the lower ranking public school is to filter low performing students from coming in and make your students look like they are well-behaving high-performing students. Kids who dye their hair are generally seen as a bit of outcasts, and black is the hair color of the natives, which are the overwhelming majority.

The \"natural causes\" designations were made by reviewing records, not actually examining the bodies, she said.>> The government's revelation comes after BuzzFeed News reported earlier Friday that directors of funeral homes and crematoriums in two municipalities were permitted by the government to burn the bodies of many people the directors thought died as a result of the hurricane \u2014 without a government pathologist examining the corpses first to determine if they should be counted in the official death toll.The 911 is not in any way an estimate of how many people have died because of the hurricane.

According to OP's article 911 have died due to officially \"natural causes\". So: (38 days / 365 days in a year) * (3,400,000 People * 0.0086 death rate per year) = 3,044 Natural deaths for the same time frame on average. From this we can conclude that Donald Trump is doing an excellent job protecting the citizens of Puerto Rico cutting their average death rate by 2/3rds after Hurricane Maria.

The \"natural causes\" designations were made by reviewing records, not actually examining the bodies, she said.>> The government's revelation comes after BuzzFeed News reported earlier Friday that directors of funeral homes and crematoriums in two municipalities were permitted by the government to burn the bodies of many people the directors thought died as a result of the hurricane \u2014 without a government pathologist examining the corpses first to determine if they should be counted in the official death toll.The 911 is not in any way an estimate of how many people have died because of the hurricane.

You can't do anything to change it huh... yet you are willingly and voluntarily voting for this system and its politicians every single time. You clearly do not understand the simplest logic. Another display of magical logic by slaves of capitalism: we like democracy, therefore we love to bend over for self-serving capitalists, because it would be dictatorship if we gave power to 1 good dictator who would work in our interest. If that dictator has a large house and makes earth utopia for everybody, then he is a bastard \"dictator,\" but if a bunch of lucky born capitalists make their life goals to fatten their pockets even more and buy 75 mansions, do fuck all for anybody else, in fact they oppress everyone else and fuck up the environment, then they are successful people who deserve respect.
