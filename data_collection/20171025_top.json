Let me set aside my cynicism for a moment and presume that Republican voters are not *100%* motivated by party affiliation.  (I've seen the studies and the polls, I've posted them more than a few times myself, I completely understand the depth and breadth of partisan animosity these days.  With that in mind, consider this a thought experiment.)  We know that a lot of the Republican zeitgeist is, erm, we'll say \"inspired\" by the right-wing media, from Fox to Breitbart to Limbaugh, such that ~~months~~ years harping on Clinton's private email server has resulted in a great deal of hatred against HRC.    Now a lot of that anger was flat out the result of the right-wing media acting like reality TV show producers, hyping the story to stratospheric levels of excitement and danger; this goes beyond simple spin, we're skirting the line between sensationalism and flat out fiction (when flat out fiction *wasn't* an obvious part of their narrative, I mean.)  But a lot of the anger was also about a very real mistake that Clinton made, and directed at what could have been an actually dangerous lapse in judgement.    The problem is that Republicans aren't hearing these stories about the Trump administration.  The private servers, and crony capitalism, the graft and waste, maybe even quid pro quo bribery in the case of Trump giving the Puerto Rico repair contract to one of his campaign donors.  Fox news won't talk about it, Breitbart won't talk about it, Limbaugh won't talk about it.... these scandals, because make no mistake that every single one of Trump's fuckups thus far are full blooded scandals, never make it through to the Republican voters' ears.

Let me set aside my cynicism for a moment and presume that Republican voters are not *100%* motivated by party affiliation.  (I've seen the studies and the polls, I've posted them more than a few times myself, I completely understand the depth and breadth of partisan animosity these days.  With that in mind, consider this a thought experiment.)  We know that a lot of the Republican zeitgeist is, erm, we'll say \"inspired\" by the right-wing media, from Fox to Breitbart to Limbaugh, such that ~~months~~ years harping on Clinton's private email server has resulted in a great deal of hatred against HRC.    Now a lot of that anger was flat out the result of the right-wing media acting like reality TV show producers, hyping the story to stratospheric levels of excitement and danger; this goes beyond simple spin, we're skirting the line between sensationalism and flat out fiction (when flat out fiction *wasn't* an obvious part of their narrative, I mean.)  But a lot of the anger was also about a very real mistake that Clinton made, and directed at what could have been an actually dangerous lapse in judgement.    The problem is that Republicans aren't hearing these stories about the Trump administration.  The private servers, and crony capitalism, the graft and waste, maybe even quid pro quo bribery in the case of Trump giving the Puerto Rico repair contract to one of his campaign donors.  Fox news won't talk about it, Breitbart won't talk about it, Limbaugh won't talk about it.... these scandals, because make no mistake that every single one of Trump's fuckups thus far are full blooded scandals, never make it through to the Republican voters' ears.

The Videogame/sports team/other subreddit posts lend credibility to the account, and also easily build positive karma histories to help get past poster requirements/look less like bots. They target those subreddits because they are high traffic, mainly not political, and easy to have upvoted content. It was REALLY telling during the NFL anthem protests by how many of the posts were circle-jerks for pro trump propaganda.There is an influx of new accounts/immediately shifting posters to be pro-trump or anti-Clinton etc around every new big story breaking.

Those sources also relayed that, according to Nix\u2019s email, Assange told the Cambridge Analytica CEO that he didn\u2019t want his help, and preferred to do the work on his own.>If the claims Nix made in that email are true, this would be the closest known connection between Trump\u2019s campaign and Assange.>Cambridge Analytica did not provide comment for this story by press time. After publication, Assange provided this statement to The Daily Beast: \u201dWe can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks.\u201d>Nobody has published the 33,000 emails that were deleted from the personal email server Hillary Clinton used while she was secretary of State.>\u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear that anybody hacked Clinton\u2019s emails or has them,\u201d said one of the sources familiar with the investigation.>Those 33,000 messages were a central focus of Trump and his allies during the campaign. At least one Republican operative tried to recruit hackers to obtain those emails, according to The Wall Street Journal. And at a press conference on July 27, 2016, while the Democratic National Convention was underway, Trump\u2014then the Republican nominee\u2014said he hoped the Kremlin would recover those emails.>\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019ll be able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said.And on the campaign trail, Trump praised WikiLeaks and tweeted about its findings. Politifact calculated that he mentioned the site about 137 times during the campaign.>\u201cI love WikiLeaks!\u201d he proclaimed at a rally on Oct. 10, shortly after the site began publishing emails hacked from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.>By April, Trump\u2019s CIA director was calling WikiLeaks a tool of Kremlin spies and the equivalent of a \u201chostile intelligence service.\u201d>Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump, was in touch with Assange through an intermediary. The House Intelligence Committee is pushing Stone to share the identity of that intermediary with them. So far, he has not complied.>Robert and Rebekah Mercer, a billionaire father-daughter duo that spent big to boost Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy, are major investors in Cambridge Analytica. Robert Mercer co-manages a hedge fund that drew scrutiny from congressional investigators in 2014 for using questionable banking tactics to allegedly dodge paying upward of $7 billion in taxes. Steve Bannon, formerly a senior White House aide, was on the company\u2019s board before he joined the White House. He has worked with the Mercers on multiple conservative projects, and Bloomberg News reported he previously had holdings in Cambridge Analytica valued at between $1 million and $5 million.>The Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica millions for its work. A former Trump campaign staffer previously told The Daily Beast that the firm did very little actual work for the campaign.A Republican digital strategist who worked with Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 campaign told The Daily Beast that Nix should not be viewed as a reliable narrator.>\u201cAlexander Nix is not credible at all,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cHe is a consummate salesman, and there are numerous instances already out in the public record where he made claims that were not just factually wrong\u2014they were total fabrications.\u201d>The source added that this doesn\u2019t mean Nix didn\u2019t reach out to Assange.>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him, if you consider every other thing that he\u2019s done, every other way that he\u2019s conducted business,\u201d the strategist added. \u201cI absolutely can see him reaching out and making an inquiry, hoping to find another way that Cambridge could become the heroes.\u201dThe article was updated to include Assange's comment.Edit: Reformatted the post to make it easier to read.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 6596, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 21:55:19 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "This, the Cohen stuff, the Peter Smith story, the news is coming thick and fast today.

Legitimate user comment with certain buzzwords, usually nothing to do with the actual text in the article or headline. I say they are legitimate users because they act more like a real person, but this could be easily faked. The legitimate posts are being parsed or looked into by the shills/bot accounts to know where to post. Almost like the brain of the operation. Less than random targeting seems more believable I guess?2. Few minutes later, spurts of posts on the subject of the legitimate user comment, always pro-trump or anti-liberal or what have you.3. Comments get called out or commented on, voted down etc.4. Comments get deleted.5. Repeat.I suggest every comment that isn't about the actual article be looked at through a lens. I check all posters like these with snoopsnoo or analyser and it's pretty telling exactly how similar they all are. They all share the same habits, word usage, simplicity of comments, same \"real\" subreddits (they learned to not use posters in TD as their army as they usually get sused out quicker). Most of them post on video game subreddits to build real karma, either before or after the account has been hijacked or bought. The Videogame/sports team/other subreddit posts lend credibility to the account, and also easily build positive karma histories to help get past poster requirements/look less like bots. They target those subreddits because they are high traffic, mainly not political, and easy to have upvoted content. It was REALLY telling during the NFL anthem protests by how many of the posts were circle-jerks for pro trump propaganda.There is an influx of new accounts/immediately shifting posters to be pro-trump or anti-Clinton etc around every new big story breaking.

Those sources also relayed that, according to Nix\u2019s email, Assange told the Cambridge Analytica CEO that he didn\u2019t want his help, and preferred to do the work on his own.>If the claims Nix made in that email are true, this would be the closest known connection between Trump\u2019s campaign and Assange.>Cambridge Analytica did not provide comment for this story by press time. After publication, Assange provided this statement to The Daily Beast: \u201dWe can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks.\u201d>Nobody has published the 33,000 emails that were deleted from the personal email server Hillary Clinton used while she was secretary of State.>\u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear that anybody hacked Clinton\u2019s emails or has them,\u201d said one of the sources familiar with the investigation.>Those 33,000 messages were a central focus of Trump and his allies during the campaign. At least one Republican operative tried to recruit hackers to obtain those emails, according to The Wall Street Journal. And at a press conference on July 27, 2016, while the Democratic National Convention was underway, Trump\u2014then the Republican nominee\u2014said he hoped the Kremlin would recover those emails.>\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019ll be able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said.And on the campaign trail, Trump praised WikiLeaks and tweeted about its findings. Politifact calculated that he mentioned the site about 137 times during the campaign.>\u201cI love WikiLeaks!\u201d he proclaimed at a rally on Oct. 10, shortly after the site began publishing emails hacked from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.>By April, Trump\u2019s CIA director was calling WikiLeaks a tool of Kremlin spies and the equivalent of a \u201chostile intelligence service.\u201d>Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump, was in touch with Assange through an intermediary. The House Intelligence Committee is pushing Stone to share the identity of that intermediary with them. So far, he has not complied.>Robert and Rebekah Mercer, a billionaire father-daughter duo that spent big to boost Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy, are major investors in Cambridge Analytica. Robert Mercer co-manages a hedge fund that drew scrutiny from congressional investigators in 2014 for using questionable banking tactics to allegedly dodge paying upward of $7 billion in taxes. Steve Bannon, formerly a senior White House aide, was on the company\u2019s board before he joined the White House. He has worked with the Mercers on multiple conservative projects, and Bloomberg News reported he previously had holdings in Cambridge Analytica valued at between $1 million and $5 million.>The Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica millions for its work. A former Trump campaign staffer previously told The Daily Beast that the firm did very little actual work for the campaign.A Republican digital strategist who worked with Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 campaign told The Daily Beast that Nix should not be viewed as a reliable narrator.>\u201cAlexander Nix is not credible at all,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cHe is a consummate salesman, and there are numerous instances already out in the public record where he made claims that were not just factually wrong\u2014they were total fabrications.\u201d>The source added that this doesn\u2019t mean Nix didn\u2019t reach out to Assange.>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him, if you consider every other thing that he\u2019s done, every other way that he\u2019s conducted business,\u201d the strategist added. \u201cI absolutely can see him reaching out and making an inquiry, hoping to find another way that Cambridge could become the heroes.\u201dThe article was updated to include Assange's comment.Edit: Reformatted the post to make it easier to read.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 6596, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 21:55:19 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "This is what the spam was all about.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 112318, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 21:50:17 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "huh.

The dossier was produced by a firm that openly markets itself as a conductor of opposition research.  The information was acquired through legitimate investigation that did not involve committing any crimes along the way.  It was bought with money, fair and square, like you do.  It came from a source that worked for one our oldest and most loyal allies.  The source came to be trusted by our own FBI.

Scandalous?  Eeeeh. I don't see it.Now in what universe is that remotely equivalent to Trump, his immediate family, his top campaign operatives, and seemingly everyone in his periphery, conspiring to run backchannel diplomatic negotiations with a hostile foreign nation without registering as foreign agents, receiving massive amounts of illegally undisclosed funds for shady transactions, accepting illegally acquiring opposition research from Russian lawyers and Wikileaks outlaws, and enjoying political aid in the form of a massive online bot army from a nation that also tried to hack our actual voting system, all in exchange for giving Putin favorable treatment on sanctions/ukraine, and allowing him to use the administration as his puppets to destabilize the entire Western world?Because that's pretty textbook treason.Explain for me the hypocrisy.

However, none of you can claim to definitively know what his mental capacity is, and the fact that all of you so quickly rush to defend another rich and powerful man is exactly the problem that many women are trying to highlight.

I'm sure it's not easy to find contractors who can do the work and want to do the work in PR. They do not have a lot of resources at their disposal like we would here in the states. They have a plan in place, an expected time frame to get it done. They are executing that plan and on schedule. So please tell me. What's the problem here and where's the conspiracy in that?

People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:> 1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.> Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals.

They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.> 2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.> 3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.> You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there.> 4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him \"fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?\"> \"Sorry,\" he says. \"I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore.\" There haven't been any real journalists for months.

You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs.

I was taught that the United States meant \"liberty and justice for all.\" You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution.

Safety?Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America.

You can keep it, sell it, rent it, leave it to your heirs; forever (theoretically).Non-citizens may purchase land/houses via Lease Hold, which is a 55 year lease held by the Kenyan government. Say a Kenyan citizen with a Free Hold wants to sell to a non-citizen. They negotiate a deal. The title is then converted from Free Hold to a 55-year Lease Hold. The lease holder must be a *resident* of Kenya. If after some time the resident lease holder wants to sell, the remaining years can be sold at whatever price seller/buyer negotiate; but the government still holds the lease and the clock keep ticking. The remaining years can be inherited by the lease holder's heirs. *Resident* lease holders have the right to renew for another 55-years upon payment of a set % of the current market value minus any capital improvements made by the holder during the lease. (Apology for knowing the exact formula.)If the lease expires, the property is sold at public auction to the highest bidder. If that bidder is non-citizen, it continues as a new 55-year lease hold. If the highest bidder is a citizen, the citizen has the option of Lease Hold or Free Hold.Bottom line, it's a pretty effective method of preventing permanent ownership by foreign non-residents.

I live in the south where Pitbulls are just about every other dog.  Unlike other parts of the country, the good ol boys who get pitbulls around here aren\u2019t buying them as status symbols or to look hard in front of their friends.  They\u2019re hunting dogs, work dogs, and family pets.  The old country guy who comes to spray for pests once a month is in love with my dog.  Pitbulls are a staple in the south.  That being said, I\u2019ve been working with and training dogs for the past two years now and every pit bull I\u2019ve met at work has been a bubbly goofy fun family dog without a malicious bone in their body.  They\u2019re very loyal, obedient, and exceptionally easy to train too.  We often have over a hundred dogs in our facility and truth be told, I\u2019ll take the pitbulls over just about any other breed we\u2019ve got.  It\u2019s honestly the smaller breed dogs that I have an issue with.I ended up adopting a pit but like I said, I know dogs well, I work with them, I\u2019m trained and know how to socialize and train a dog.  I treat my pit bull like a daughter and she is extremely cuddly and friendly.  She\u2019s also 70 plus pounds and fully capable of killing someone if she wanted.The point is, pitbulls are dogs.  period.  They\u2019re going to behave like dogs.  They aren\u2019t monsters, they aren\u2019t angels.  They\u2019re dogs.  Knowing what they are capable of means that most people who have a pit are going to make sure they go through far more training and socialization than your average dog.  It\u2019s not that they *require* more training or socialization than other dogs but the stigma makes it necessary.  A shit dog owner can usually get away with mistreating or neglecting their small breed house dogs.  They\u2019ll have a shitty destructive disobedient dog but it just won\u2019t be capable of killing a person.  Failure to properly train and socialize a pit bull on the other hand can have deadly consequences.  Every large breed is dangerous though.  Every large breed is capable of killing and maiming a person.  Even Labrador retrievers score lower on temperament tests than pitbulls do.  I don\u2019t know what the solution is because banning a breed that doesn\u2019t deserve the ban is absolutely something I\u2019m against.  But demanding a certain level of responsibility from people who get pitbulls is an absolute must.  I love my dog and I won\u2019t give her up without a fight. (Truth be told, I\u2019d likely get violent if someone came to my home to take her away from me)  That said...  I\u2019d be more than happy to go through obligatory training, testing, and licensing to prove I\u2019m a responsible pitbull handler/owner because the truth is, there aren\u2019t just people out there who have no business owning pitbulls...  there are people out there who have no business owning a dog period.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 102, "stickied": false, "score": 33, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 17:09:41 2017", "ups": 33}, {"body": "I've been bailed up by piece of shit pitbulls on two occasions, after doing absolutely nothing, except walking along the street.

I live in the south where Pitbulls are just about every other dog.  Unlike other parts of the country, the good ol boys who get pitbulls around here aren\u2019t buying them as status symbols or to look hard in front of their friends.  They\u2019re hunting dogs, work dogs, and family pets.  The old country guy who comes to spray for pests once a month is in love with my dog.  Pitbulls are a staple in the south.  That being said, I\u2019ve been working with and training dogs for the past two years now and every pit bull I\u2019ve met at work has been a bubbly goofy fun family dog without a malicious bone in their body.  They\u2019re very loyal, obedient, and exceptionally easy to train too.  We often have over a hundred dogs in our facility and truth be told, I\u2019ll take the pitbulls over just about any other breed we\u2019ve got.  It\u2019s honestly the smaller breed dogs that I have an issue with.I ended up adopting a pit but like I said, I know dogs well, I work with them, I\u2019m trained and know how to socialize and train a dog.  I treat my pit bull like a daughter and she is extremely cuddly and friendly.  She\u2019s also 70 plus pounds and fully capable of killing someone if she wanted.The point is, pitbulls are dogs.  period.  They\u2019re going to behave like dogs.  They aren\u2019t monsters, they aren\u2019t angels.  They\u2019re dogs.  Knowing what they are capable of means that most people who have a pit are going to make sure they go through far more training and socialization than your average dog.  It\u2019s not that they *require* more training or socialization than other dogs but the stigma makes it necessary.  A shit dog owner can usually get away with mistreating or neglecting their small breed house dogs.  They\u2019ll have a shitty destructive disobedient dog but it just won\u2019t be capable of killing a person.  Failure to properly train and socialize a pit bull on the other hand can have deadly consequences.  Every large breed is dangerous though.  Every large breed is capable of killing and maiming a person.  Even Labrador retrievers score lower on temperament tests than pitbulls do.  I don\u2019t know what the solution is because banning a breed that doesn\u2019t deserve the ban is absolutely something I\u2019m against.  But demanding a certain level of responsibility from people who get pitbulls is an absolute must.  I love my dog and I won\u2019t give her up without a fight. (Truth be told, I\u2019d likely get violent if someone came to my home to take her away from me)  That said...  I\u2019d be more than happy to go through obligatory training, testing, and licensing to prove I\u2019m a responsible pitbull handler/owner because the truth is, there aren\u2019t just people out there who have no business owning pitbulls...  there are people out there who have no business owning a dog period.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 102, "stickied": false, "score": 32, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 17:09:41 2017", "ups": 32}, {"body": "Articles on pit bull attacks are mere filler pieces written to take up space in between sex scandals or the latest screw up by the president.

There are a lot of large, strong dog breeds that could substantially fuck someone up if they flip out or attack. I feel when these conversations come up we talk directly about underestimating pitbulls while leaving other common breeds like German Shepherd, or Mastiff, or Rottweiler (all breeds that actually have a stronger bite force than pitbulls http://dogs.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Which_Dog_Breed_Has_the_Strongest_Jaw).And temperament tests have shown that pitbulls, as a breed, are actually quite calm and friendly with humans as compared to many breeds, and score among the best in temperament testing (http://atts.org/breed-statistics/statistics-page1/). So I guess my response to these types of comments is... Yeah, pitbulls can be dangerous. But I also think it's unfair to single them out in that statement when there are many other large and powerful dog breeds that can also be dangerous when they turn on a human. Let's not forget that breeds like Doberman, German Shepherds, and Rottweilers all shared time as the boogeyman breeds for decades before the pitbull (http://allpetnews.com/dangerous-dogs-by-the-decade), and now they seem to rarely nudge their way into conversations like this when pictures are posted of them.
