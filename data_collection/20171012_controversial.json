A lot of my colleagues dislike him and have done some pretty immature pranks on some of the other workers who voted for him; I really don't care about him or politics in general when I'm working or need to be professional. Personally I voted independent, if anyone's curious.A bit of backstory. My dad is a retired veteran who became a businessman after he got out in his 40's; he probably shares some similar general views as Trump(although my dad does think Trump's a moron, he always said you have to be fake to make it some places in life) and is a very personable guy so they seemed to get along at least on the outside. Trump went to the same country club as us down in Florida and always liked talking to my dad so I did see interactions with him as a child which really weren't much more than \"How are you sport?\" followed by some hair ruffles. At least he didn't pinch my cheeks or tell my parents I was eating candy I wasn't supposed to; decent enough guy as far as child me is concerned. My mom always thought he was some powerful businessman but really didn't care much about him or anyone in my dad's circles for that matter. All she really ever said was \"He's got lots of money\" and \"He was on Oprah. He's your Dad's friend, not mine.\"I joined the military after high school in 2006 and he saw me a couple of days prior since my Dad brought all his business friends over for the party. Some of them asked me why I joined in very negative tones and tried to berate my parents but I shrugged it off. Trump gave me a handshake, looked me in the eyes, and thanked me for my service to this country. Better than some of the politicians that I met while serving who would refuse to acknowledge us even if we were on their detail. Not gonna burn anybody on that as that's whole different set of stories but I've carried some grudges into local and nationwide elections. It's hard not to be bitter when the media and civilians portray someone as fantastic and they wouldn't even glance at you when you're expected to jump on a grenade for them. Maybe that's just me.After my five year contract ended I left the military, went to college, and got a business and accounting degree with a focus in internal audit. Saw Trump a little while after I got my degree and had been working; I told him my major and focus and he kind of chuckled and said \"Gotta watch out for you if someone ever wanted to get me. Good luck, take care dude. See ya around.\" Just those fake kinds of business \"pleasantries\" you get used to working in that environment. I'd say throughout my life, I'd regard them as positive interactions. Nothing extraordinary, just the kind of positive interactions you would have with an acquaintance that you enjoy seeing, but wouldn't spend extended periods of time with.tl;dr: Had interactions with Trump throughout my life. Kid interactions: He was like the adult that lets you have an extra cookie or brownie and then ruffle your hair.Teen/Young Adult: Pleasant and respectful; at least he didn't ask me why i was throwing my life away by joining the military and berating my parents like other adults in my life.Adult: Generally polite with mild humor business type interactions.

The cabin is tiny and now there's 9 people in it.So the guy I had just had sex with wants me to shag his mate, which I was kind of getting in the mood for, so the guy I was with rolls out of bed and this guy climbs in.It was actually really good, there was a kind of good atmosphere in the room, I liked the majority of the guys, and the next guy I had sex with was a guy I'd been good friends with since we'd started working on board.So the cab was tiny and one of the guys opened the door so they'd have some more room to maneuver.Now I've just had sex with three different guy, one of them twice and I really want a shower and I also wanted to change the sheets.There was an agent for the owner on board, we didn't have guests on board at the time but he was on board doing something. He was always hanging out around the female berths, and generally being a nuisance, he'd shagged one of the other girls, he really didn't appeal to me.So he's there at the door smiling, he's a big guy and even if he wasn't in a position of authority he'd have been capable of getting his way with a lot of people.Anyway so he barges his way past the guys, and of course he settles on me.In a way I kind of admired, the way that the ordered my friend out of bed, and then insisted that he then give him a leg up (rather than use the step).He then proceeded to perform oral sex on me, making a point of licking up whatever was sprayed on my tummy and thighs.He did all this while making sure everyone could see, then he made my friend support my shoulders while he fucked me from behind.It was kind of hot, but more than a little disgusting.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7035, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 21:18:33 2017", "ups": 5}, {"body": "was giving oral to a lovely lady as her friend was helping out with a hitachi.  sploosh, squirted all over me. normally i'm cool with it, but this was an exceptional squirt. like, puerto rico level. i hit the shower in a relief effort, and got back to business.

The cabin is tiny and now there's 9 people in it.So the guy I had just had sex with wants me to shag his mate, which I was kind of getting in the mood for, so the guy I was with rolls out of bed and this guy climbs in.It was actually really good, there was a kind of good atmosphere in the room, I liked the majority of the guys, and the next guy I had sex with was a guy I'd been good friends with since we'd started working on board.So the cab was tiny and one of the guys opened the door so they'd have some more room to maneuver.Now I've just had sex with three different guy, one of them twice and I really want a shower and I also wanted to change the sheets.There was an agent for the owner on board, we didn't have guests on board at the time but he was on board doing something. He was always hanging out around the female berths, and generally being a nuisance, he'd shagged one of the other girls, he really didn't appeal to me.So he's there at the door smiling, he's a big guy and even if he wasn't in a position of authority he'd have been capable of getting his way with a lot of people.Anyway so he barges his way past the guys, and of course he settles on me.In a way I kind of admired, the way that the ordered my friend out of bed, and then insisted that he then give him a leg up (rather than use the step).He then proceeded to perform oral sex on me, making a point of licking up whatever was sprayed on my tummy and thighs.He did all this while making sure everyone could see, then he made my friend support my shoulders while he fucked me from behind.It was kind of hot, but more than a little disgusting.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7035, "stickied": false, "score": 7, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 21:18:33 2017", "ups": 7}, {"body": "This one time, my coworker asked me if I liked to swing.

If she says yes you both probably had a good time and I'd say the odds are in your favor that it goes at least a couple dates which may involve sex. If you're more compatible than initially understood it'll go longer so long as no other variables come in (social, addiction, money, health). Being decently groomed, *genuinely* nice (not nice in a way you think you'll get something but nice in that you better genuinely give a shit about every decent person you interact with and not as a facade. Just be a good fucking person for fucks sake.), and being able to hold a fun two way conversation. Looks of course enter into it but you and she should understand this is a date, that should be clear, and the fact that she accepted after the coffee indicates in an implicit way that you don't find each other abhorrent. That doesn't mean it might not work for other reasons. I'm just saying if you made it that far just focus on being you. If being you is attractive to her and you are attracted to the real her then everyone is happy. If you need alcohol to be the real you, that's not the best thing.Love isn't chess. It's checkers.

Is just an approximation of GR in the limit of weak field and slow-moving masses.This limit is taken because (1) GR is very nonlinear and thus solving for the field for 99% of the possible sources is impossible analytically and (2) unless you are very close to a black hole or neutron star or cosmic string fields in the real world will be very, very weak and speeds nonrelativistic and GEM is a very, very good approximation. It's also easier to understand and conceptualize.The answer is no, there is in fact a difference, both in full GR and in the GEM approximation.

A while ago, my ex dumped me and I honestly thought I would never be attracted to anyone else again. It was my first break up so now that I have gotten over it, I've seen that this is not the case. He was very good to me - I've suffered with bad anxiety in the past and he was always understanding (even though it sometimes caused rifts between us) and always had his phone on at night in case I had to call him in an emergency. He was always supportive whenever I had a bad day and often cooked (and enjoyed cooking) meals for me when we were together. We did long distance for a year and he'd call me almost everyday without fail and always made sure I was feeling loved. We got on extremely well, were always laughing and having a good time, it was incredibly joyous relationship in some respects. However, thinking back on it, there were some aspects of the relationship that were not good. I always perceived our sex life to be good as we had so much chemistry, but he never cared whether or not I orgasmed, if he hurt me during sex, and always refused to give me oral (despite the fact that I was very generous towards him). I don't think he ever cheated on me, but he would continually flirt with other women, upload photos with them calling them beautiful, and claim it was just his outgoing personality. He ignored me on my birthday one year because he was dancing with another girl... looking back with perspective, I can see that I deserved to be treated with more respect. Since then I've dated a few guys and have received nothing but disrespect and fear. I've been led on, have been the other woman (did not know he had a girlfriend), have been stalked, have been sexually harassed and assaulted. I began to distrust men.I met a guy a few months ago who seemed too good to be true after all of this. He, too, enjoyed cooking for me and always made me dishes from his home country and was elated when I enjoyed them. Every time I cooked for him it was almost as if he felt guilty and told me I didn't have to... but of course I enjoyed it too and wanted to return the favour. I stayed with him for a while during a difficult time in my life and he did everything he could to make my life easier. He was always making sure I was warm (offering to give me extra coats if I was cold) and felt safe, told me I could text him if anything happened when I was out somewhere (after two guys followed me and kept slapping me on the ass on one traumatic evening) and he'd try his best to help, and always hugging me and dancing with me and doing things like that if I'd had a bad day. The sex was amazing and he'd always make sure that I had come first, was very generous with oral ect and would always be stroking my skin and touching my hair afterwards, something that relaxes me and that my ex also refused to do. He recently broke things off because he has realized that he was too hurt from previous relationships to put himself in a vulnerable position again and has told me that he doesn't think relationships are for him anymore. We've had long conversations about this and I do truly think he is being genuine and that there isn't another person. Even if that's not the case, there's nothing I can do about it now. After being treated so kindly and with such respect, he's set the bar extremely high for any future relationships. So much so that I fear I will never feel respected again, considering that men in the past have caused me hurt, fear, and distrust. I don't know how I'm ever going to even open myself up to anyone again, let alone find someone who will be good to me as this guy has been. I know it's not the be all and end all to be in a relationship, but it is something I really want for the future but doesn't feel like it'll ever happen now. Does anyone have any advice on this? How can I stay open to meeting a man who will respect me when I've been met with disrespect in the past? I feel like it has been a cruel joke to experience respect just to have it taken away.

No cheese.I got cheese.Linda, waitress over (burger place), let me tell you why 'it's only a little bit of cheese' is not reassuring, why I flinch back and will instantly throw away the burger at just a touch.Because lactose intolerance is a bitch, like I heard you mutter about me being.And I can and will, and have, told others about why it's 'such a big deal to make' . It's gross, and I don't mind sharing details, honey.It used to not be so bad. It used to just make me feel full like I'd eaten three meals at once. It's gotten worse lately. I got on an ice cream binge and ate three spoonfuls of ice cream, not much I know, but it was so good.I paid for it.First it feels slightly nauseous, like you have a stone in your gullet. Then you can feel the pulsing thickness in the space just below your stomach, in your gut, something that's thickened and refuses to move.That's your poo! Congrats.After that? It all comes pouring out, if you're lucky. Diarrhea where you have to sit for a good half hour on the toilet, if you're not lucky it's popping out of both places.Down it goes, up it goes. And well, you only have one toilet. So it goes for an hour, two hours, maybe. It's violent and awful and you're gasping for breath and shaking and sobbing with your pants off to the side because of this horribleness and you can't bear to feel any sort of tighteness on your belly right now and the toilet is...let's not talk about that.Or maybe you're curled up in the bath under a shower pouring on you because you didn't make it to the toilet.Congrats on that too.And then you just feel empty. Powerless. Everything you've had that day is gone down into the sewage system, possibly. Your butt hurts, mostly because that poo really never came out, unless you eat right (perhaps it's my own refusal to eat veggies, ta) . But ah well.And trust me when I say you start looking out for things that contain milk, or cheese. That your body turns you against it really hard and really fast. And when someone, a family member who just wants you to eat their world famous milk chocolate chip cookies, or a server at the restaurant just doesn't want to take your food back just because 'it's just a bit of cheese/milk', you remember the days when you could say that. That just a bit would be okay.Those days are long gone.So please, I really wish, really really wish, when someone asks you to remove the cheese or make sure there's no milk in it, don't make these little disparaging comments or think they're blowing out of porportion. Even if they are, even if they're doing a diet just to lose weight and don't want these items, how does it harm you just to make sure NOT to put that ingredient in?", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "75z15u", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "\"It's only a bit of cheese/milk\"", "num_comments": 26, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 5, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 2243, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/75z15u/its_only_a_bit_of_cheesemilk/", "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 22:40:18 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "oh jeez, I hate it when that happens.My boyfriend has celiac's and the slightest ingestion of any form of gluten will take him out for days.

You're probably more stressed or anxious than you thought you were. And don't think any of these things are meaningless because they can certainly cause a *lot* of stress! Also, worrying over all these small details on top of that probably isn't helping, either. If you were forgetting all of your *daily* tasks, full conversations or entire events and people, that might be worrisome, but for now it seems like you just need an adjustment in your life to reduce the amount of stress or emotional impact. If you're that concerned, you can talk with a doctor, counsellor or a therapist. That might be a good idea anyway just to put your mind at ease and hear from a professional what the best course of action might be. Do you exercise or have any hobbies and interests? Now sounds like a good time to get to know yourself and your body again, so I would start with some self-care. I recommend colouring or doing something repetitive (and preferrably fun) that will help you to stay calm and focused.

I've never talked to anyone about this and it's been something that's been dwelling in my mind for a long time.Let me start out by prefacing with the fact that I have a really insane ex boyfriend, he likes to stop by my place in the middle of night every few months and slash my tires, I've moved recently and am hoping that will be the end of that.I stayed in the horrid relationship. Ultimately to get the truth out of him, that he had slashed my tires after I had dumped him the first time. And I did, I got the confession, dumped him right away and unfortunately didn't do much about it besides get my tires slashed two more times.This... assault, happened during a large, local pirate event my friends group likes to go. I spent most of it drunkingly crying after he continuously got mad at me over stupid shit. This night he was mad simply because I had gotten drunk, just enough to bring out my social side, and wandered off into the main event with his friend's girlfriend who was even less drunk that I. Perfectly harmless right? Not to him I guess.The same night, after me and the other kind girl had returned to camp from our outing, which I really enjoyed. I continued to get drunker to cope with his meaningless anger and still attempt to have fun with all of the people around me that I enjoy so dearly to this day. But I really shouldn't have been able to trust myself to drink that much, much less trust my terrifying boyfriend to take care of me at the time, and sure enough as he was still reprimanding me, we laid down in the tent he wanted to have sex for some reason.I was curled up in a ball, praying for sleep when he had decided the argument was done. He repeatedly asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. To which I ignored, because that's fucking crazy. But I guess he took that as a yes. It was short lived, and the only mental scaring I have is those days when I'm alone and can't stop being angry about the whole situation in general. But I have a boyfriend now who's the definition of perfect, and he helps me out a lot, by simply showing me that not every relationship is bad. This was just something I really needed to get off my chest, because the thing that happened at the pirate event was something I've never talked to anyone about.

My dad was in and out of prison during my child hood and my mom made the right choice keeping him out of my life.When I met him 5 years ago, he accused my husband of stealing a tote of toys (which definitely didn't happen) after he even had walked us to the vehicle.Did I mention he's still a raging alcoholic?My brother and I got to know each other some on Facebook but it never worked out for us to meet up. I guess I never thought we would only end up having a 7 month window to do it.What I didn't know was that my brother was a heroin addict. I understand why he didn't tell me because that isn't something you just tell someone right out the gate, but it was a shock to me when I found out he overdosed, while living in a sober home. I went into what felt like shock. Anger and regret filled me. We had an opportunity 5 years prior to be involved in each other's lives and my father ruined that when he cut himself off from me. The only time I got to see my brother in person, was in a casket.One of the things my brother had told me was that I should give our dad another chance, that he'd changed. I never thought much of it until it became the only thing he'd ever turn out to ask of me... I met with my father after my brother died. We had supper together and it was terribly awkward.

He and I have always clicked well as friends and have hung out platonically a handful of times since the break-up without any hint of it going further. I had other mutual friends at this party so I decided it seemed fun overall and headed over. We were all drinking and having one of the best nights I'd had in a while. Somehow he and I just kept gravitating toward each other, laughing and talking. Nothing out of he ordinary happened until the end of the night when he started to get touchy and invited me over. I was having fun and had nothing else tying me down so I decided to go for it. We got to his place and were about to hook up when I insisted he wear a condom. We used to have unprotected sex when we were dating but we had been broken up for a year at this point and I obviously had no idea who he had been with during that time. He tried convincing me to change my mind, saying he couldn't feel anything with a condom on and that he didn't have an STI (even though he has never been tested). He even tried telling me he didn't have any condoms, but I knew he did. Now at this point I wanted this to happen as much as he did, but I was not willing to risk my sexual health just to get laid, so I reiterated my reasoning. He continued with his foreplay, relentlessly trying to win me over. I was getting frustrated by the fact that he wouldn't just put a condom on already, when suddenly he just tried to go for it. I kept saying, \"no\" and \"stop\" but his only response was to keep trying while saying, \"you're fine\" and \"it's fine I don't have anything,\" almost laughing as he said it as if I was being unreasonable. Finally I pushed away from him and said, \"I just really feel like you're not respecting me and what I'm asking of you right now.\" He immediately got off me and laid on the other side of the bed silently. I tried to explain myself again, and he just ignored me. I told him I wanted to have sex but I just wanted him to wear a condom and he refused, continuing to ignore me. He said that having sex with a condom was the same as not having sex at all so he wouldn't do it. We both went to sleep and that was it. I almost feel like he was punishing me, \"if we're not going to have sex my way, then you aren't going to get to enjoy it either.\" The entire situation really bothered me and obviously left me frustrated. I guess I just wanted to hear other women's experiences with men and their reluctance/refusal to use a condom, or possibly other men's thoughts on being asked to use one. I know that no one prefers to use one, but I had never been with a guy who seemed so immature about the situation. I also always felt like during our relationship he had some type of narcissistic tendencies and I wonder if this situation could be an indicator/symptom of something like that.tl;dr: my ex tried relentlessly to have sex without a condom but I insisted he use one.

My friend (also Indian) recently told me about her cousin who married a man who ended up abusing her physically. She moved out and divorced him. Her family is still upset with her for \"giving up on the marriage\". It's almost expected for women in Indian culture to put up with physical abuse. I overhead a conversation with my mother and aunt and they were talking about how my father and uncle have never hit them, and how great they were for that! As if they should get some kind of commendation for not being physically abusive? It was really strange. **Financial abuse** - Women in my mother's generation was discouraged from working outside the home. My mother became a housewife, as society, family, parents expected and encouraged. She raised 4 kids. My dad made the money, and while he gave her access to some of it, he would often make unilateral financial decisions without any input from her. He spent a lot of money financing the lives of his sister and her husband (who treated my mother like garbage) against my mother's wishes (she wanted the money to go towards mine and my siblings' education). In many marriages it's worse. Financial abuse is a type of abuse people rarely think of.**Lack of freedom of movement** - When I visit India to see my family, I'm never left alone. I cannot walk around outside after dark. I must always be chaperoned. Part of the reason I hate visiting is that I feel less like a person and more like an object that's going to get stolen. I realize it's to prevent kidnap/rape/etc, but it still feels like I'm being treated like a child. It's worse in some other countries. **Lack of support or justice for rape and abuse victims** - Rape victims are treated pretty terribly by indian law enforcement. Lot of victim blaming. Families often discourage their daughters from going to court. Male victims almost never go to court. Beyond that, victims are often treated as if their lives are over. Rape victims aren't considered \"marriageable.\" \"Acid attacks\" are real problem in India - sometimes a man who was rejected by a woman will throw corrosive acid in her face - to horribly disfigure her, blind or kill her. Or he'll target her boyfriend.**Daughters being inferior to sons** - My parents had 4 children. 3 daughters and 1 youngest son. My parents kept having children until they had a son. A friend of mine in high school was not allowed to touch her male relatives or go into the prayer room in her house or the kitchen when she was on her period. Her brother was always the preferred child - her parents even gave him a larger bedroom than her even though he was six years younger. In Indian culture, sons are considered far more valuable, while daughters are considered a burden. Part of that is because daughters entail dowries and they're supposed to belong to their husband's family, not their birth family. In India, it's illegal to know the sex of your baby before it's born - because so many couples tried to abort after realizing they were having a daughter. [Female infanticide is also a problem in India](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/05/trash-bin-babies-indias-female-infanticide-crisis/257672/)  Another huge problem is [dowry death](https://www.thenational.ae/world/dowries-and-death-continue-apace-in-india-1.81522).

I tried making up personalities and seeing them as real people, and then what hit me was: Women have had to follow a very strict patriarchal society for a long time where the goal was to get them married off: whether by a forced marriage or a matter of being considered a business proposition or just to no longer be a liability - throughout time women have been on the receiving end of shit by having to follow their fathers/husbands and then comply with society's rules. (Of course this still happens today but there's definitely been a massive shift away from this thinking as well)It just lead me to think...of all my ancestors, how many women liked their lives? How many women were forced to have sex with their husbands (marital rape?)? How many of my grandparents loved each other? How many of my grandmothers were gay or bi?

To complete the second year, however, you need to have an apprenticeship or some form of work experience because you need to complete a certain number of real-life on-the-job hours along with the ongoing in-college studies to get the full qualification.So, towards the end of the first year, the college admins started kicking students up the arse to go out and get their apprenticeships/work experience lined up. They didn't have any official links with any companies offering such positions, so the onus was on you to go and find one. They did offer an 'advice' session. I rung around all the large companies I could think of and got nowhere, so I took up this offer.It basically consisted of the adviser spending an hour telling me: \"The mistake you've been making is that you've only been approaching the large companies.
