I vote in every election possible. I even voted in my town's city counsel primary, where there were 13 people on the ballot and only 12 would go to the general election. All but pointless.

They also know immigration is way down.

One more year of rambling, fighting petty wars, but no increase in wages will lose Trump another 10-15% of his base. The leftovers are true believers and evangelicals who love the rolling back of rights. Trump actually is very aware of his need to produce wages.

Wade, David Shugar, Carley Corrado, Devin Jokerst, Carol KitayamaEarth\u2019s Future 2017DOI: 10.1002/2016EF000531Link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000531/fullAbstract> Global renewable electricity generation capacity has rapidly increased in the past decade. Increasing the sustainability of electricity generation and the market share of solar photovoltaics (PV) will require continued cost reductions or higher efficiencies. Wavelength-Selective Photovoltaic Systems (WSPVs) combine luminescent solar cell technology with conventional silicon-based PV, thereby increasing efficiency and lowering the cost of electricity generation. WSPVs absorb some of the blue and green wavelengths of the solar spectrum but transmit the remaining wavelengths that can be utilized by photosynthesis for plants growing below. WSPVs are ideal for integrating electricity generation with glasshouse production, but it is not clear how they may affect plant development and physiological processes. The effects of tomato photosynthesis under WSPVs showed a small decrease in water use, whereas there were minimal effects on the number and fresh weight of fruit for a number of commercial species. Although more research is required on the impacts of WSPVs, they are a promising technology for greater integration of distributed electricity generation with food production operations, for reducing water loss in crops grown in controlled environments, as building-integrated solar facilities, or as alternatives to high-impact PV for energy generation over agricultural or natural ecosystems.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 51899, "comment_id": "dpdfref", "score": 5, "submission_time": "Sun Nov  5 13:51:01 2017", "ups": 5}, {"body": "Where can I buy one?", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 85, "comment_id": "dpdw95x", "score": 2, "submission_time": "Sun Nov  5 21:02:51 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Show me a non-solar greenhouse and I'll consider reading this article.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 64695, "comment_id": "dpek4jq", "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Nov  6 04:09:47 2017", "ups": 1}], "subreddit": "technology", "selftext": "", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "7awxrl", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Solar greenhouses generate electricity and grow crops at the same time, UC Santa Cruz study reveals", "num_comments": 12, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 276, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 4687701, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/7awxrl/solar_greenhouses_generate_electricity_and_grow/", "submission_time": "Sun Nov  5 13:47:51 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/11/loik-greenhouse.html", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "So the Republicans said \"no\" to the continued storage of a satellite built in the 90's that the Air Force admitted was obsolete, but still wanted to launch in 2020 anyway at a cost off $500 million.

It's worth noting that Trump's tax plan calls for the repatriation of offshore wealth subject to a one-time tax, and a closure of the loopholes that allowed such offshoring in the first place. It's not a perfect solution -- the U.S. Constitution prevents punishing these offenders if there was no crime for their behavior on the books when the act was committed (that is, *ex post facto* prosecution) -- but the new scheme *is* a step in the right direction.With the details of the tax plan being recently released, my feelings are mixed. While the tax reform will, as promised, most definitely benefit the middle class through the reconstruction of the tax brackets, I feel like it could have went further in this regard. For example, the new 12% lowest bracket will apply for income up to $45,000, which I would have liked to have seen apply up to $50,000 or $60,000. But the new \"12% up to $45,000\" bracket *will*, when coupled with the (roughly) doubling of the standard deduction, lower the taxable income of many middle class individuals and families by at least several thousand dollars per year.All things considered, I think that -- unlike the idiotic attempts to \"reform\" healthcare -- the tax reform legislation is legitimately important and a benefit to our economy if passed. If the bill gets overly-politicized on the theory that *\"anything Trump creates is inherently evil and thus unworthy of consideration\"* and is gridlocked as a result thereof, I will be seriously pissed.-----EDIT: It's kind of funny that my support -- also containing appropriate & honest critique -- of a bill, got downvoted because the bill has the name \"Trump\" associated with it.

Moreover, the Chinese bank in this scenario, is also obliged under US law to disclose all transactions associated with  your account which means that US citizens are increasingly finding it more difficult to hold bank accounts outside of the US! Land of the free policies know no borders so think of the implications of calling for worldwide taxation on your own  sovereignty and privacy before lashing out on the minority because in the end, the change that you call for, as always, will hit the middle and lower classes while the elite of the elite find a new way to squirrel away their wealth.

Medicine, clothing etc.pp). And yes, thats why we need to make sure, that it is as clean and efficient as possible.I do not support Trump's plan to bring coal jobs back, as its an dieing (for good) industry etc. and those clear obligations against climate change on the highest levels (just another recent worldnews thread ist about destroying a new polar ice research satellite for storage costs is hilarious).The topic off climate change is more than just green energy/life on the one side and the bad or better dark ages of fossil fuels. If Exxon and others hadn't denied their research about CO2/climate change and maybe had been the first invested in green energy, who knows..30 years of research in that field..maybe we wouldn't be so depend on it right now.But we are. So, always have in mind, that a rush out off fossil fuels will have major draw backs. Our aims should be:-heavy investment in green energy research and tech-heavy political improvements in fossil fuel regulations (it can be quite \"clean\", but loosend regulations caused by lobbyism/corruption is a major reason for unnecesary endangerment of our climate in general and the area close to powerplants/drilling sites (chemicals used in fracking: often leakage of the trucks transporting those or of pipelines lead to contamination of the surface area; coal ashes and other residuals from power plants are not stored or cleaned/processed/recycled properly also leading to contamination of the proximity or worse (e.g. rivers); leakave of oil tankers; all because of no or poor regualations because of..well, money!PS: natural gas is quite a good tech to use as a placeholder (a technique used for transition???)-heavy investment in climate/green education. How can you and me save resources in our daily life with non to little investment (why is there no regulation, that only energy(water) saving shower heads are sold etc.)//information about decentralized energy systems//information about climate change and how it effects everybodys(!) life already; most people still don't understand that fact and live in there small bubble and that topic is too far away to fetch it (too abstract).-heavy investment in re-education of those left behind by all those changes. Workings in coal mining or power plants won't get their jobs back. Green energy offers a wide variety of new jobs. If I remember corretly there are already small programs in the US trying to get mining workers a job via re-education in IT or something similar. -->acutally the education part is the most important. As long as people don't care about plastic and the use of it and how it affects people on the oder side of the world and then again the whole world..puh. Nothing will change.Think about plastic (bottles) and electronic scrap beeing moved to asia/africa or getting produced there and in the end polluting the rivers. I bet most of you reading this know about those (causal) cycles.tl;dr: Since decades there should be not just black/white anymore, there is a good reason why 50 shades of grey was such an phenomena, thats reality! Even though our brain tries to simplify everthing so that we can manage our lifes and don't get to freightend all the time, just keep in mind. nature and especially humanity is super complex.

YouTube and Facebook have talked about an inability to have a human actually be the person reviewing the nature of content that may or may not be removed in the past.  The shear volume of data is beyond what most organizations could handle, much less monitor.So, they attempt to scan content and have measures in place to remove \"offensive\" or \"questionable\" content.  They're a public company that attempts to provide a free service that they can monetize.  They want the site to be friendly to 5-year-olds, grandmothers, Comcast, new artists, and whoever else.That they'd attempt to avoid having violent, disturbing, or pornographic content seems obvious in context of the kind of site it is.  That they'd attempt to automate it so they don't have to search out every bit of murder-porn as it's added is also obvious in the context of the fact they've already stated they're unable to review everything added manually.This results in educational videos being removed occasionally (presumably under filters designed to remove pornography), while actual fetish stuff stays up unnoticed till reported.

I kept hoping someone would just tell me what to do.  On the very slim chance you, person who is reading this right now, was at the scene or knows someone who was:Whoever you are, I remember what today feels like, and how alone and overwhelmed you must feel.  You are not alone.  There are--sadly--thousands of us shooting survivors around, and we are all rooting for you to get through this.  You're going to have a tough one to six months, but I promise you, it will get better.  On to a little bit of advice.  **PRIMARY TIPS*** **Do not drink to cope with this.**  I stopped drinking until my therapist told me I no longer qualified as having PTSD, and it is probably the only thing that saved me from becoming an alcoholic. * Find someone to keep track of your hospital and police paperwork.  There will be a lot of it and you will probably not have the emotional fortitude to deal with it, because you will be so pissed off that it's in your life.  A parent, a sibling, a spouse, a friend--tell them they should handle any insurance claims or evidence requests.* If you are offered a victim's advocate's card, **take it.**  I turned one down; better to have it and not need it than the other way around.  * Take advantage of delivery services for groceries and toiletries.  It's okay if your world shrinks.* Keep an eye out for PTSD symptoms. **PTSD SYMPTOMS** Please, please be watchful for signs of PTSD.  Here's a non-exhaustive list of symptoms to watch out for:* Having bad dreams at night or have trouble sleeping* Being afraid or nervous* Feeling very sad or angry or without hope* Being forgetful or not able to pay attention* Feeling as if you cannot control your thoughts and memories* Losing or gaining weight* Having headaches, stomach aches or problems eating* Feeling like no one understands you or that your life was stolen from you* Avoiding places with crowds* Drinking or doing drugs* Avoiding talking about the shootingYou might experience a few of these for a while, and then they'll dissipate on their own.  Great!  But if they persist or are interfering with your daily life, you might need to seek professional counseling.  Please hear this: counseling is not anything to be ashamed of.  If you need it, get it.  Seriously.  **WHAT KIND OF COUNSELING SHOULD I GET?**I did prolonged exposure therapy (PET). I have gotten PMs from folks who did EMDR and liked it~~, but I'm not certain whether the scientific community really buys that approach~~ [SEE ETA #2, BELOW].  At any rate, the most important thing is to find a **good** therapist. There should be a social worker or police officer who can refer you to a qualified PTSD therapist at the scene or at the hospital. **You will need to see a specialist, not a generalist. You do not want to be the person's first PTSD patient.** That being said, if you are choosing between a generalist and no therapist, get your ass in the room with the generalist.  I unfortunately do not have recommendations in Texas, but given the scale of this incident, you may be given a list of therapists by a social worker in the next couple of weeks.**ARE THERE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR ME IN TEXAS?**Yes.  Lots of them.  Given the size of the event, there may be specialized funds devoted to this.  There will *definitely* be GoFundMes.  I can't give you any advice on those, but I can tell you about the standard Texas Victims' Compensation Program.  Under that program, you are eligible for up to $50,000 in benefits.  **That includes mental health treatment--take advantage of that.**  The program only covers expenses insurance doesn't otherwise cover.  If you are uninsured and your treatment is going to be more expensive than victim's comp can cover, ask your hospital about charitable write-offs for the bill--some hospitals will write off crime victim bills.  More information about the Texas Victims' Compensation Program is [here.](https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/cvs/crime-victims-compensation-reimbursable-expenses)Expect this process to take a while and be annoying.  It's worth it in the end.  Make a family member or friend you trust handle it.  (I really want to emphasize that it needs to be someone you trusts--you will be asked for a lot of personal information, including your SSN).  If you can get a victim's advocate assigned, make them do it.  **DOES IT GET BETTER?**Yes.  You're not the first person to go through this, as awful as it is. The next few months might be hell, but it can get better. I'm about three years out from being shot, and life is fairly normal these days. I sleep fine. I can go to places that look like where I got shot.  I promise you, it will get easier--and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about what to expect.  *If you are a shooting survivor and would like to help me refine the above text, or if you know of a qualified PTSD therapist or center in Texas, please PM me, and I will add it.  If you are a licensed therapist or psychologist, please reach out--I would really value your input.*ETA 1:  If you are a parent who needs to talk to your child about this stuff, [this guide](http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Talking-To-Children-About-Terrorism-And-War-087.aspx) from the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychology might help guide your conversation.ETA 2:  I had previously suggested that I wasn't certain whether EMDR was an accepted therapy.  /u/boonefrog pointed me to a pair of resources that suggest that it is effective, if not entirely understood.

How do you train a system on content you've never seen before though? Or perhaps more interestingly, what happens if the content changes? The core of the bot problem and the reason it will never be completely solved is that at the end of the day the best you can do is say \"these features make it likely that this is bot content\". As soon as the bot authors discover you are selecting for those features, they'll just go \"ok let's author it a little different\" and so the infinite cycle continues. Sure you can start over banning stuff but at some point people are are going to notice that even real content is being deleted. If you go this route then you end up the center of a giant conspiracy theory like Yelp is today. I'm sure you can imagine the headlines \"FACEBOOK deletion bot has a CLEAR left wing bias\"This also explains why tech companies are so cryptic about their methods. If you leak even a little bit about how it works, then the bot authors are all over it.

Along with hidden Country of Origin Labeling, which was reinstated in 2015 under questionable circumstances, \"USDA Organic\" labeled products are not a reliable indicator of organic product.Even if product happened to be from real organic farms, the USDA, according to the Office of The Inspector General, hasn't been monitoring that the imported organics were not fumigated with pesticides and insecticides on arrival, which is standard import practice to kill off foreign invasive species. As you read, the US Office of the inspector General was clearly distraught about it. If imports must be fumigated, then they fail organic standards, defeating the purpose. On the other hand, you can't have invasive species so you have to fumigate. Native crops, as with any country, are not put through a fumigation process.It's so critical that, even though it has yet to reach headlines, Congress is acting fast.

Our audit found that AMS needs to strengthen its controls over the approval and oversight of international trade arrangements and agreements for the import of organic products into the United States. First, we concluded that AMS\u2019 process for determining equivalency of organic standards **lacked transparency**. NOP officials maintained documentation of the process to resolve differences between foreign and USDA organic standards, but they did not have a methodology in place to disclose the results of that process to stakeholders. Next, we concluded that AMS was **unable to provide reasonable assurance** that NOP required documents were reviewed at U.S. ports of entry to verify **that imported agricultural products labeled as organic were from certified organic foreign farms and businesses that produce and sell organic products.** Further, imported agricultural products, whether **organic or conventional, are sometimes fumigated at U.S. ports of entry to prevent prohibited pests from entering the United States.** AMS has **not established and implemented controls at U.S. ports of entry to identify, track, and ensure treated organic products are not sold, labeled, or represented as organic.** AMS officials concurred with our findings and recommendations, and we accepted management decision on all nine recommendations.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 54267, "comment_id": "dpdt3da", "score": 32, "submission_time": "Sun Nov  5 20:02:57 2017", "ups": 32}, {"body": "Even though most of us here never looked into any evidence of this.

Rapidly changing genes is termed antigenic variation and it makes vaccine development difficult because it is like hitting a moving target - the flu vaccine covers a certain set of genes and is useless if these genes mutate. This is why our current flu vaccines are so ineffective - we have to guess what mutations will be most prevalent during the upcoming flu season and often we are wrong.A research team has isolated core genes in influenza present for a long time in the virus\u2019 genetic code. This suggests these particular genes are central to virus performing its functions and are thus less likely to survive mutations (any virus mutating these core genes would not be able to infect cells and thus can\u2019t replicate - essentially \u201cdying\u201d). This gives hope for a more effective vaccine against many different strains of flu.HOWEVER - this is far from a \u201cuniversal vaccine\u201d - take once and forever be protected from all possible mutations of the flu. This research team has only tested their vaccine on lab mice - no human trials. To give some context we have been curing cancer in mice for decades but have not seen these same results transfer to humans because of biological differences including side effects and loss of effectivity. In addition, the vaccine only worked to prevent infection from 7 of the 9 flu strains tested. Meaning even if the vaccine works in human trials, it is still vulnerable to the same mutation problem our current vaccines face.Edit: Formating", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 2879, "comment_id": "dpdybfn", "score": 20, "submission_time": "Sun Nov  5 21:38:57 2017", "ups": 20}, {"body": "My life is already half over.
