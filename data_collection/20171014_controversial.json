I hope you understood what I meant, namely the anti-Muslims), we don't care if you pranked us in to eating pork. Quite contrary, we will pray to God to guide you to the right path to become a good person, ( not necessarily a Muslim ).B) We don't hate Jesus. In fact, we love him very much. To be honest, Jesus' role as a prophet will have a bigger impact on humanity in the future than Prophet Muhammed's actions ( pbuh ). C) We dislike ISIS/Boko Haram/Al Qaeda and other groups of low IQ morons as well, if not even more than you do. We really aren't dancing, partying, eating cake and singing victory songs when we hear of an \" Islamic \" terrorist attack  on television. D) We don't dislike non-muslims. Lakum deenukum wa liya din. You have your faith and we have ours. That's absolutely fine. E) This is something most people normally know, but I would still like to make it clear. Not all Muslims are Arabs ( Edit: and not all Arabs are Muslims. Credit to /u/30-xv for this ). You have Asian Muslims ( example: Indonesians ), you have European Muslims ( ex.: Albanians, Bosnians, Russians ), you have Indigenous North African Muslims ( Berbers ), You have Sub-Saharan African Muslims ( ex.: Somalians ), you have Persian Muslims ( Iranians ), etc. We are extremely diverse and we are not all the same!F) Allah is not a specific God for us alone. Allah means \" The God \" because we believe there is only one. It's the same God of the Christians and the Jews. G) Probably the most interesting for non-Muslims. Paradise is not only for \" us \". It's divided in 7 layers. The top layers are designed for the most pious Muslims and the lower ones for the less observant ones. An Atheist who dedicated his life to help poor and sick people or animals is more likely to be granted a place in heaven  than a \"Muslim\" who prays five times a day but smokes weed and doesn't respect his parents.

(Did I just say that?)The problem comes from the fact that if that family had even a recessive gene for some disease, the offspring of those people are GUARANTEED to have that disease.

But that's probably impossible in today's society.

It has enough kinetic energy to get about half way up the valley way before it rolls back down towards the center. On the other side of the valley wall, the terrain slopes back down so that some distance away, it is at the same elevation as the center of the valley.

It has enough kinetic energy to get about half way up the valley way before it rolls back down towards the center. On the other side of the valley wall, the terrain slopes back down so that some distance away, it is at the same elevation as the center of the valley. Classically, that ball is destined to stay inside the valley for eternity. It doesn't have enough kinetic energy to get over the valley wall and down the other side. But if it was a quantum mechanical particle instead of a macroscopic ball, then as time goes on and the system evolves, the wave function expands beyond the valley wall and there becomes some probability that the particle will be found outside of the valley even though it's kinetic/potential energy never changed and never got large enough to get over the valley wall. It \"tunneled\" through the wall.This is how things like radioactive decay happen. An alpha particle being part of a nucleus is a low energy configuration because the residual strong force is attractive and stronger than the electric force at close distances so it holds it inside the nucleus. An alpha particle far from the nucleus is a low energy configuration as well because the strong force falls off and the electric force is repulsive keeping it away from the nucleus.

Because that can start a premature detonation- \"nuclear fizzle\"- in the microsecond before optimum density is achieved.  Both these are so slow they're virtually non-radioactive.  Plutonium is especially toxic, however, chemically.  Uranium too.Thermonuclear \"hydrogen bomb\" weapons which use tritium (hydrogen isotope) *fusion* fuel have to deal with its 12 yr half-life.  In these designs, fusion is not actually a significant part of the energy- it's there to force a more through % of fission in the uranium/plutonium fuel, which increases the possible size of the explosion, also reduces the mass of uranium/plutonium fuel needed.  Now in many designs, lithium-6 deuteride is used to generate tritium during the detonation.  However, AFAIK some tritium is still needed to initiate this reaction.  All tritium is produced by lithium-6 bombardment in a special reactor, not related to nuclear power reactors.  It does not \"keep\" due to its 12 yr half-life and refrigeration does nothing to preserve it.Bottom line, thermonuclear hydrogen bombs DO need replacement of tritium every few years.Tritium is not integrated into the weapon AFAIK, whether it's part of the fuel or just an initiator, it's pumped in during the priming process from an external container.   All modern nuclear weapons are that thermonuclear \"h-bomb\" type and require tritium.Now the 12 yr half-life doesn't mean it's useless at 12 years.  It becomes diluted with new helium as the tritium decays.  Details on how enriched the tritium must be is very classified.  If the weapon still works at 12.5% tritium, that's 36 yrs after mfg.  If you had something in the storage container that adsorbed helium into a solid, the gas will always be 100% tritium, just losing more and more mass over the years.  In theory you could start with a large overkill of tritium in storage and still have enough left after a very long period to prime the weapon.Or, more likely, you'd have tritium (hydrogen) bonded into a solid/liquid such as iron hydride, as it decays the helium will always be an unbonded gas, which you could simply vent over time.  During priming you shut the vent, chemically force the iron hydride to release the tritium-hydrogen, and have high-purity tritium gas despite being after many half-lives.Outside of that, we worry about general decay of the tech.  Plastic explosives are used to compress the core have  a limited shelf life.  Electronics don't last forever even if unpowered.  A battery is essential to power the electronics.  A non-rechargeable lithium battery would last for like 10+ years, some dry-storage batteries that you have to mechanically mix the electrolyte into could in theory be dry-stored for hundred of years.Bottom line, if you're considering a fictional post-apocalyptic discovery of a long-abandoned nuclear weapon, it will probably not be usable due to loss of tritium.

All depends on the isotopes you use at the different stages of reaction, and the interaction they have with each other in the detonation process which is  the crux and would require precise modelling to truely answer.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1806, "stickied": false, "score": 7, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 14 21:03:03 2017", "ups": 7}, {"body": "Interestingly enough this has already happened once.

The water got hot, evaporated, which turned the reactor off. Once it was cool enough again, water would flow in again and start the cycle anew.

Because that can start a premature detonation- \"nuclear fizzle\"- in the microsecond before optimum density is achieved.  Both these are so slow they're virtually non-radioactive.  Plutonium is especially toxic, however, chemically.  Uranium too.Thermonuclear \"hydrogen bomb\" weapons which use tritium (hydrogen isotope) *fusion* fuel have to deal with its 12 yr half-life.  In these designs, fusion is not actually a significant part of the energy- it's there to force a more through % of fission in the uranium/plutonium fuel, which increases the possible size of the explosion, also reduces the mass of uranium/plutonium fuel needed.  Now in many designs, lithium-6 deuteride is used to generate tritium during the detonation.  However, AFAIK some tritium is still needed to initiate this reaction.  All tritium is produced by lithium-6 bombardment in a special reactor, not related to nuclear power reactors.  It does not \"keep\" due to its 12 yr half-life and refrigeration does nothing to preserve it.Bottom line, thermonuclear hydrogen bombs DO need replacement of tritium every few years.Tritium is not integrated into the weapon AFAIK, whether it's part of the fuel or just an initiator, it's pumped in during the priming process from an external container.   All modern nuclear weapons are that thermonuclear \"h-bomb\" type and require tritium.Now the 12 yr half-life doesn't mean it's useless at 12 years.  It becomes diluted with new helium as the tritium decays.  Details on how enriched the tritium must be is very classified.  If the weapon still works at 12.5% tritium, that's 36 yrs after mfg.  If you had something in the storage container that adsorbed helium into a solid, the gas will always be 100% tritium, just losing more and more mass over the years.  In theory you could start with a large overkill of tritium in storage and still have enough left after a very long period to prime the weapon.Or, more likely, you'd have tritium (hydrogen) bonded into a solid/liquid such as iron hydride, as it decays the helium will always be an unbonded gas, which you could simply vent over time.  During priming you shut the vent, chemically force the iron hydride to release the tritium-hydrogen, and have high-purity tritium gas despite being after many half-lives.Outside of that, we worry about general decay of the tech.  Plastic explosives are used to compress the core have  a limited shelf life.  Electronics don't last forever even if unpowered.  A battery is essential to power the electronics.  A non-rechargeable lithium battery would last for like 10+ years, some dry-storage batteries that you have to mechanically mix the electrolyte into could in theory be dry-stored for hundred of years.Bottom line, if you're considering a fictional post-apocalyptic discovery of a long-abandoned nuclear weapon, it will probably not be usable due to loss of tritium.  Even the above \"iron hydride\" scheme would be a problem after 120 years=12x half-lives= 0.10% of the original tritium mass remains.

It did make for some interesting countertop surfaces and such though.  :)", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 36447, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 14 21:35:05 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Would this help in forest fires?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 16548, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 14 21:51:29 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Well that article was poorly written and misleading.

This retreat is held yearly in New Brunswick, British Columbia, and Ontario and is facilitated by registered nurses, social workers, music therapists ,and an expressive arts instructor. We also offer monthly circles of strength as a means for families to discuss their experiences with bereavement.I had a very positive experience at camp, where I connected with so many individuals and families. I am a student who is currently studying to become a mental health nurse and learned so much on this retreat, not only about bereavement and grief but about connecting with others and forming a therapeutic relationship. During the 4 days of Camp Kerry, I don't think I've laughed, cried, or smiled so much.I was designated to run group for \"littles, which consisted of children ages 4-8. It touched my heart to see how resilient children are when it comes to recovering from the loss of a family member. This was my first experience with facilitating a therapeutic group.  I was not alone in this, I had a lot of support from other staff of Camp Kerry, and had another staff member to assist for if any of the children needed 1 on 1 time. Overall, this experience really strengthened my desire to become a mental health worker and gives me hope that one day I will be able to take my knowledge and life experience to help others overcome their mental health challenges.It would really mean a lot to me if you took a moment to vote for Camp Kerry society to receive a grant from Aviva through their community funding contest.

He and I have been divorced a while now, and I had assumed that he would be too antisocial to ever date again. But he found somebody.They look like they might already be engaged, and, based on my interactions with him, I would bet he has pushed her to get pregnant. (I was the frigid bitch who denied him the option of having a child.)My time with him was absolutely horrible. He basically did everything but hit me. And between his tantrums and blow-ups, he interspersed enough calm to lull me into thinking that he wasn't the psychopath that he is. I am certain that he would not have been happy until he completely ruined my life. And when he was done, he would have blamed the whole thing on me.My first reaction to seeing the picture was, \"Oh good. He found somebody else to focus on.\" My second thought was, \"Oh god. The next ten years of her life are going to suck.\"My heart just breaks for this woman. I feel so bad for her. They were all smiles in the picture, but I imagine he has already started grooming her. I remember the specific escalation in the fights that he and I had and his calm, almost delighted demeanor, as he ripped my heart apart. I can't make her choices for her. I can't stop it. So, if you're out there, and you've just gotten engaged to the love of your life (and of course he is smart, handsome, well-spoken, and ever the professional; perfect on paper), here were a few of the warning signs that I ignored:- In the first fight, he questioned my commitment to him. I ended up crying hysterically for an hour and trying to prove that I was not a slut.- In the second fight (which occurred about a year later), he stormed out of a restaurant without paying because the food didn't arrive fast enough. He screamed at me for not being a team player because I wanted to wait for the waiter to come back to close out our tab.- When I decided that I was through with him, he broke down into tears and said that he was sad that his personality was driving me away. That was the only time I ever saw him cry, and I was dumb enough to believe him and take him back.Those were big fights. We would almost break up, but, he would come crawling back and we would work through them, with him promising to be more flexible, and me promising to help meet him halfway. In our ongoing daily life, he was almost always a fun, happy-go-lucky guy. He was so funny. Smart. We used to have these fabulous conversations and try new, exotic restaurants. But, there were little signs that he was going to get worse:- He blamed me for stuff that wasn't my fault. Not big things. But stuff like not cleaning the kitchen sink when he had said he would do it. I just thought, \"He is nuts. He said he was gonna do it.\" And I let it go. But he never stopped believing that all of those things were my fault.- He would drive too fast if we were in a hurry. He was an incredibly aggressive driver. - He pushed me to be closer to his friend's wives. He REALLY wanted me to only hang out with them, but what he said was, \"They're just really awesome people. Why would you hang out with anybody else?\"- He had interpersonal issues at work. When called in by HR to explain, he always twisted it around and got out of it.- On the way home from social gatherings, he would review the things that I had said and tell me why people took those things the wrong way and offer suggestions for future social gatherings. He would always wince at something I had said as if it would ruin his relationship with his other friends. I thought that he was overreacting, and I ignored it. But of course, in hindsight, I realize that he was trying to make me doubt myself.- He was incredibly suspicious of anybody except his close friends and family. At first it was just, \"Are you sure you want to trust him?\" but then it became, \"You are stupid to trust any of these people and you should not hang out with them ever again.\"- He would interrupt my stories about my day at work to question why I handled things that way that I did. \"Why did you tell your boss XYZ?\" \"Why would you make your coworkers think ABC?\"- If he got agitated (which happened for random reasons that I was never able to predict), he would deliberately say incredibly hurtful things. He would apologize later, after the storm was over, but eventually the apologies stopped, and the agitation was all the time.- He was ALWAYS calm when he was angry. He always treated me like a student or an employee. He never yelled. Never got flustered. Every line was delivered with precision and designed to get me to change my behavior. He would become increasingly insistent if I pushed back on him, and he would scoff at my reasoning. - He talked a LOT about us being a team. He was quick to make me his \"family.\" I thought it was endearing that he felt so much allegiance to me. Instead, he was imposing on me obligations to follow his lead.Between all of these incidents, we made love, we made dinners, we built a life together. But, the behavior escalated. And by then, he had done things that were much more damaging than just a few fights.I can't imagine this post would make a difference for anybody. But, maybe for somebody out there who just had a wonderfully romantic courtship with a guy who got left behind by his awful, horrible, selfish wife, a few of these lines will give you pause for consideration. Remember: He is handsome and smart and everything you have ever wanted in a man. And he is currently doing a really good job of sweeping you off your feet. All of that is an act, and it is really hard to get away from a man like that when you have two kids and a massive mortgage (did I mention that he isn't good with money either?).TL:DR My ex's new wife is in for a hard time.

We need to focus more on building systems that enable girls to do whatever they like and are capable of in the same vein that they exist for men (without directly trying to persuade them into certain career paths over others) and we really need to stop supporting the marketing gimmick that is the image of female-empowerment.

Long story short, we both cheated on each other once but I later found out that the one time he cheated, he had sex with the girl. Cheating is cheating, but once I found out that he had full blown sex with this girl, while I didn't get to that step with my indiscretion, something changed. We've been dating for over 3 years, we've been dating on and off for a span of 7 years and I've never been more in love. He is supportive, kind, loving and always knows how to lift me up. Since the cheating, I can truly say we've both grown up. Our relationship has never been stronger and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Unfortunately I can't get over how insecure I still feel. To this day, I constantly compare myself to this girl. I see pictures of her and can't help but hate everything about myself. How superficial is that? My boyfriend loves who I am inside and loves my body yet I think he would still prefer her body over mine. I think the cheating hurt so much because we lost our virginities to each other and he would always say that he could never imagine having sex with anyone else. But his first week of his freshmen year at college, he sleeps with someone else. It took so long for me to have sex with him. I knew I wanted to lose it to him since I was in middle school. But I could never find the courage to be in that intimate and vulnerable state because I hate my body. Stretch marks, acne, fat, discoloration, hair, uneven proportions...just everything. I always said to myself that I needed to love my body before letting someone else love me in that way but I didn't feel like I had to be \"perfect\" to be with him. We have an incredible sex life and he continues to love every inch of me. With that said, I'm getting to the point where I feel like I can't move on with him completely unless I get over my own insecurities. I'm still so jealous of her, I still ache imagining him lusting over another girls body, I still can't look in the mirror and love what I see. I suffer in silence and nights like this, when I feel like I have to post something on Reddit to get advice, are the nights that kill me. As I'm writing this I'm trying to catch my breath from my sobbing, I'm trying to get rid of this agonizing pain I feel in my chest and I'm trying to erase the past, but I can't. How can I love someone else so much and how can they love me just as much, but I can't fully commit because I don't love my body. When am I going to stop hurting? I'm striving to be fit and healthy, look my best and feel my best but for some reason, I feel that even if I get to that state of comfort with my body, I'm never going to stop comparing myself to the girl that he cheated on me with.

LTL FTP on mobile yadda yadda.A long one.... but please read. It's extremely important. Some of you already know all this but it's still worth a read. I am having major surgery on November 1st: I'm having a full hysterectomy. Following years of wanting it, I am now appropriately scared at being told I have to have one. At 16 I began having problems with my periods. Dizziness, nausea, heavy bleeding. My GP dismissed my concerns telling me that I would get used to it. At 21 I couldn't leave the house on my final day of menstruation because of the clotting. I worked in a pub part time and had to ask regular customers on several occasions to go to the shop to get me 'supplies' because no matter how many pads and tampons I had, it was never enough. By 26 it was 2 days a week of being housebound and I was scared to sleep because of the continuous 'accidents' I had. My GP suggested going on the pill. It didn't help other than to stop the pain and dull my senses enough that I couldn't tell when I needed to visit a bathroom to change. By 30 I was missing occasional days from work and my colleagues were having to make allowances for me when I was there; covering huge amounts of time when I disappeared to use bathrooms, change my clothes. By 35 I was in such pain and so sick that my ability to function on any level was difficult. My relationship, my children, my family, my friends and my colleagues all suffered neglect from me.  My GP suggested I use a different absorbency product. I protested until the pill was suggested. I protested until my GP suggested I was suffering from stress. I gave up talking to GPs for a while.By 38 I was spending my days and nights counting and dreading. I was then up to 7 days of bleeding every 28 days, from my previous 5 days every 35. And it was getting worse. My GP suggested going on the pill and taking more exercise. I couldn't go out for a week every month; could barely leave the house for the first 5 days. I would phone my Mum up and bore her with details. She suggested I went to see the GP.By 40 I was asking my GP for a hysterectomy because I wasn't sure how much more I could take. My wife was fed up with me being even more useless than usual and I was tired all the time. At 41 I changed jobs and hoped that my new colleagues would be as understanding as my old ones. Residential isn't a great place to work when you're scared to stand up, sit down or go out anywhere for 8 days a month. My work bag was getting bigger and bigger because of the amount of changes of clothes I had to carry around. My GP prescribed some tablets. They made me very sick and didn't lessen the bleeding. At 42 I cried to my GP and said I wasn't being taken seriously. He prescribed some different tablets. They worked for the first month and I was on cloud nine. I actually went out!The following month the tablets stopped working. It was worse than ever. I began wearing children's pull up nappies at night, as well as the highest absorbency tampons and pads. And I still couldn't sleep because I still had to get out of bed every 20-30 mins to change.I went to my GP. He asked how many tampons I used a day. I said about 30 as well as pads. He rolled his eyes and dismissed my comments. He increased the dose of medication. It didn't work. And the pain was getting worse as well as the bleeding and clotting getting worse. One night on the phone to my Mum, she suggested out of concern that I went to A&E whilst in 'a state' so they would believe how bad it was. I felt that I was being over dramatic and decided to stop moaning. 2 months after that (August just gone) I woke up one morning (with a hangover). After going to the bathroom, I felt an intense pain in my side. It spread to my back and I started vomiting. After 2 hours of sweating, swearing, curling up on my bed and vomiting, I text (my wife) who was out. I told her I was on the verge of calling an ambulance. I have never, ever been anywhere close to considering this for myself before. Ten minutes later she came home having not read the text as she was driving. She looked at me and told me she was calling an ambulance. 30 mg of morphine and 45 mins later my breathing had normalised and the pain was controlled enough for me to walk down our stairs to the ambulance. I was admitted to hospital immediately. I had more morphine (beginning to feel tired but happier by this stage!) and a CAT scan to diagnose/ rule out kidney stones. It showed a mass on my left ovary and a mass behind my uterus. I waited on a ward for 5 days for an ultrasound scan. I missed my sons birthday and I cried for many hours. The pain was controlled but always present. I looked 7+ months pregnant. Every consultant told me something a little different: what they all agreed on was that the Cancer markers in my blood tests were raised and that I needed more tests. The Doctor doing the ultrasound said he'd never seen so many fibroids in one uterus before and he'd been doing the job for 30 years. One was 6cm long and 2.5cm wide and had a fibroid growing out of a fibroid. The pain might be being caused by either the 'tumour' on my ovary or by the fibroids being twisted. Eventually they would cut their own blood supply off and the pain would subside. I was out on Nil By Mouth for imminent surgery. I was assigned to the oncologist on the gynaecology ward and was very scared. He told me not to worry. The surgery didn't happen as they wanted to carry out further tests and not rush in to anything. I was discharged after one Consultant told me that I should take a laxative and would probably feel better. I won't describe that particular experience, but it wasn't pleasant. And I didn't feel better for it. I asked what I should do for pain relief. He prescribed me paracetamol. I also had an injection to shut down my ovaries so they would stop producing hormones. I was told that once I experienced the symptoms of menopause I would soon realised that I didn't  want a hysterectomy.  I had an MRI scan 2 weeks later so the consultant had a better idea of what was happening. I also had an outpatient appointment for 6 weeks later. After the MRI my appointment was brought forward 3 weeks (to a week after the scan). It was more than frightening. I have NEVER heard of an NHS appointment being brought forward before. The consultant told me and my wife not to panic, but that as well as the tumour on the left ovary (5cm diameter) there was a larger one on the right ovary which didn't look like a 'normal' cyst and is bleeding in to itself. It might be cancerous. Also that I have many enlarged nymph glands in my pelvis that may or may not be cancerous. I have been advised to have a hysterectomy urgently. Every single consultant I saw whilst in hospital asked me why I hadn't sought medical advice sooner as I must have been suffering badly for a long time. I make no apology if people find this information disgusting, inappropriate or 'private'. I share it not because I want everyone to know my personal details, but because I feel very strongly that real problems get missed because women are not taken seriously with some health issues. For 25 years I have known that something isn't right. For 25 years I have been dismissed as overreacting to having periods. The woman in the bed next to me had an ovarian cyst weighing 1 and a half stone removed. She had been to her GP several times and had been referred to weight watchers for her weight gain and health issues. After surgery the lab results showed stage 1 cancer in the cyst. The woman in the bed opposite me had a 3 stone tumour removed and is waiting for the results. Another woman was given the all clear health wise in April having been to her GP many times. She continued to visit them until they agreed to a referral. She had a biopsy and I heard the Consultant telling her after surgery that she has stage 4 cancer in too many organs for them to do anything other than palliative care. That night I wept with her in the dark and lonely ward whilst the nurse urged us to be quiet for fear of disturbing others. I met a woman on the ward that hadn't been able to eat anything but soup for 4 months and couldn't walk due to her size. It was ovarian cancerous cysts. I am not ashamed of my body or health problems. I don't mind discussing them if it helps others. Both male and female (predominately female) have ignored/ dismissed my symptoms for years. If this long winded post helps one person get help sooner, it's worth it. If you have concerns, please make more of a fuss than I dared to. If you think your 'female things' aren't normal; the chances are they're not. No body knows your body better than you do. Ask for a referral to a gynaecologist and don't leave the surgery without it. I don't blame the individuals (apart from the man that decided it was just constipation despite scans showing otherwise. I blame the taboo. In the last 6 weeks I have discovered that many of my friends and colleagues have had similar experiences. If we don't talk and make it a main stream issue, it won't improve. Never mind all these 'raise awareness' Facebook posts. This isn't a meme. This is me being real , and quite honestly; being scared.  In the mean time look after yourselves, have a check up and talk to other women.

Then we start dating and it all goes to shit. These were all great guys. We have about a year of being all over each other, then in year two, I start to do my own things again. But they dont get back to their life. They kind of stagnate. They dont get back to the things that make them happy. They pull back from their friends, stop playing sports, get bored or fed up with career stuff. Generally they just all get to this point of depression. So because this has happened in FIVE of my relationships i'm pretty sure its got something to do with me. This sounds pretty terrible but they always tell me its not me. They all have said that they are happy with our relationship and that its got nothing to do with the relationship (on my end, I also believe this because we are generally still happy together). In ALL cases we were open and honest in communication, i'm a pretty chill girl so i dont care about a lot of things. Usually I just encourage them to be themselves and be honest with me. I encourage them to do whatever they want to do. If they want a new career, pursue whatever you want. If they want new friends, I understand. If they want to hang out with their old friends totally fine. Now because it has happened in ALL of my relationships. I think it has something to do with me. Now most of the time, I try to weather the storm and just support them through it. The past relationships I waited about 2 years (Im only 33 so two years is a long time in dating life).

When I first started working I worked on some very small independent projects and mostly that was fine there was the usual on set hooking up that goes on but I assumed that it was consensual.However as I took more and more professional I noticed that as a young female I was repeatedly targeted by older men in my department. One offered me a lift (I was supposed to be impressed by his sports car) and when I turned down his requests that he just take me back to his house for some \"fun\" he went to production the next day and complained about my work and my contract was not renewed, he also tried it on again . The worst was when the head of the department I was in took and interest in me he tired to give me drugs, repeadedly tried to get me to go to his hotel with him and invited me to come and live with him in London where he could get me a great job. When I refused he told me I'd never get on unless I learned to make \"friends\" with the right people. In the end I dropped out of the industry because I was too sensitive to be sexually harrasssed everyday at work by any man who throught he was superior to me. I'm not an actress, I'm not even that pretty and at the time I was about 165lbs so not skinny.

A few weeks ago, a good friend of mine from high school shot himself. They found him with the gun, box, and receipt. We had drifted apart over the years, and the last I had saw him was 3 years ago. It hit me kind of hard, but I moved passed it. On Wednesday, I found out a coworker shot herself. We weren't particularly close, but we always joked around when she was in the office. She always seemed like the kind of person who knew how to deal with her shit. I always looked up to her in a sense, because she was one of the top performers in my position. I was also joking the other day with someone about how her and I were the only female instructors in our position. My close friend, who was her roommate, found her when my boss called to ask where she was when she didn't show up on Arizona for work.Just a few minutes ago, I found out my first real boyfriend, and first love, killed him self. He also took my virginity. We've not been in contact since our break up like, almost 10 years ago, but I definitely had an anxiety attack when I saw the news on Facebook. I don't ever have panic attacks. I'm sure I'm feeling the way I am because of the connection we shared years ago. He was an asshole to me, but I would often think about him through the years, probably because of the virginity thing. I don't have the details, but I'm assuming he shot himself. He was very good friends with the guy who killed himself a few weeks ago. I'm feeling very overwhelmed, mostly because I don't understand why this is the solution. I've made some calls, and talked it out a bit, but it's still just such a shock to lose 3 people to the same thing in less than a month.

Any ideas how I can ruin this group fast enough to where none of the Admins or other Moderators will notice and stop me? Two-three hours is fast enough since  I'm usually up at hours in which they would not be. I could probably delete ~10,000 people while watching a movie but that's not a big enough dent.Note: a Moderator role, not an Admin, I can't remove any of the other Admins or Mods.
