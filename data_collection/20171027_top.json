I have 2 children aged 7 and 9, we lived in a area that was low income \"E-Rate funding at 90%\" the school system had zero money for anything no after school programs no supplies for teacher no nothing. Now I am a home owner and a mid class income earner so I pay an unfortunate amount of attention to my taxes and how they get spent. On average the past school district received $6700 per child so how the fu@#$ did they not have any money? Ahhh the 5 school super superintendents making around $150k  and then the 7 school principals  making 90-110k and then the 7 assistant principals making 70-90k. Well that is odd. So our school district could not meet the states min standardized testing so the school district was on the verge of losing its accreditation. So! we say f this we have the means to either put our kids in private school \"mind you neither of us are religious\" or move to a better school district. We ended up buying a nice house in a much better \"ranked\" school system. Well last year the school district announced that \"gasp\" they have no money!!!!! The school is put on financial watch so all books are opened up all the way down to who the bid for the printer toner went to as well as wages ect.. So guess what, there was 15M dollars going to 35 people at the top all on a 90M budget for the district. Ahh and the sports complex that they built behind the amazing sports complex ya that was a good idea o and then the swimming complex across the street from the 2 sports complex that is nice. All while my daughter doesnt even have a f'in math book because the school can not afford it. Ahh math club after school nope thats gone. Music class? thats gone.... So the county put a vote up that said \"hey if we dont raise your property taxes the school system will fail\" up goes my taxes! an extra $65 a month on top of the $200ish already a month that I pay taxes to the school district. Now here is the kicker, I work for a religious private school. I work in IT and as some of you know this provides me with lets say insider info. This particular private school does have some of the vices that we all complain about, sex education is \"dont have sex\" wtf? however this school operates on a budget of $4300 per child, and let me tell you the education the children receive is far far better than the education my children receive in the public system. The school gets zero state funding and a drop of federal spending. All teachers make about the same or less than the public school counterpart and get this, the administrator make a reasonable wage!!!! 70k for the principal and and 60k for the assistant principal. We have no sports complex we have nothing fancy just a good education. The teachers do not teach for the kids to pass the standardized test yet the school averages 20% higher on testing. Now I know the student body is different than a public school but this school has a policy to not turn anyone away \"assuming you can cough up half the tuition, then we fund raise to cover the rest\" Its just not a black and white issue here guys. I agree some private school are bad, most charter school are bad, but for fu@# sake if the school is accredited give the parents the choice to send there kids where ever the heck they want.

Much of that material was drawn from decommissioned Russian weapons under an agreement with Washington known as the \u201cMegatons to Megawatts\u201d program, which converted the uranium from thousands of nuclear warheads for civilian use in U.S. nuclear power plants.>Mikerin\u2019s arrest followed a seven year investigation that began initially as a U.S. intelligence probe into Russian nuclear officials, according to court records and people familiar with the matter.>Before arresting Mikerin last year, federal agents had sought to get him to work undercover in its investigation into senior Russian energy officials, according to court records.>In an effort to obtain his cooperation, U.S. federal agents brought him to a \u201cwar room\u201d they had set up in an office adjacent to his in Chevy Chase, Maryland.>Plastered on the wall were pictures of Mikerin and diagrams of his possible relationship to shell companies and other Russian energy officials, including President Vladimir Putin, according to court records. After Mikerin refused to cooperate, he was arrested.Claims that $145 million were a conflict of interest \"from the Russians\" is false. Majority of what they're citing came from a founding member of UrAsia (Canadian) who sold all his stock holdings when the company merged with Uranium One in 2007. The rest of that money that could even be connected to Uranium One came from another founding member of UrAsia (also Canadian) who did stay on after the merger.http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/oct/24/what-you-need-know-about-hillary-clinton-and-urani/>Second, while we concluded that nine people related to the company did at some point donate to the Clinton Foundation, we found that the bulk of the $145 million came from Giustra. Guistra said he sold all of his stakes in Uranium One in the fall of 2007, \"at least 18 months before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state\" and three years before the Russian deal.>We couldn\u2019t independently verify Giustra\u2019s claim, but if he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from confirmed Uranium One investors drops from more than $145 million to $4 million.>The main exception is Ian Telfer, an investor who the New York Times found donated between $1.3 million and $5.6 million to the Clinton Foundation during and after the review process for the Russian deal.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 317, "stickied": false, "score": 321, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 27 19:45:15 2017", "ups": 321}, {"body": "I've never seen a right wing conspiracy theory that makes sense. * Uranium One* Seth Rich* PizzaGate* Obama being a Kenyan Muslim Socialist They're all bullshit and without logic.

They just care about themselves not getting caught doing illegal stuff, yes, they did hide their votes in order to not get caught.There's just a lot more on that, but basically Catalonia is basically throwing lies, they keep saying that the EU will accept them even tho it's been said multiple times that they won't.

I have a location independent career and I travel the world. Now I'm learning how to invest that money and using the law of compounding interest (which I learned fro people like evil billionaire Warren Buffet) to grow that income into multi-generational wealth. One day - at a much older age - I will be one of these evil, evil billionaires! ON NO!!There's plenty of room at the top folks. Plenty of room to succeed. Plenty of paths to success. Most of you don't want to be billionaires or even millionaires. Most people would be happy with a six-figure income and savings.Here's the thing folks - NOBODY who manages their money correctly, even if they don't make that much, stays poor. It is IMPOSSIBLE to manage your money correctly and stay poor. Fucking *impossible*. Anybody could start with $500 and grow that money by 10% to 30% a year in the least. But Americans are more likely to blow their money on a Friday night, never save up, and never plan for the future. Then they look at those evil, evil billionaires and say \"GIMMIE GIMMIE GIMMIE!\"Money isn't stagnant folks. Go out there and make a success of yourself by - GASP - reading about and learning from those same dirty, evil capitalist pigs. Its funny, I've been staying in Southeast Asia for a bit now and I know some very wealthy Chinese, Thais and Filipinos.Most of them started with nothing. One of them started by picking bananas in the jungle and selling them on the streets when they were kids. Then they started apprenticing at a Teak Wood Factory and teaching themselves English. Then they started helping businesses in America source their Teak wood from that factory. Then she expanded her operation. She became a millionaire by the end of her twenties (in US dollars). Then began investing in properties, many of those investments she was able to re-sell later for upwards of 2,000% to 5,000% profit gains.Others she built vacation bungalows on and rented them out. Now - even with three children and being a single mother - she has started a brand new company making rice cakes and is currently in a distribution deal. She also started a beauty mask company. Whenever she has an idea, she just does her research and rolls with it. What I've noticed is that people in developing countries try harder and they started with NOTHING Americans have. They don't fucking complain about rich people - they learn from them. The first billionaire in Vietnam is a woman who started with virtually nothing.

Just one million dollars kept liquid at swim's work paying .7% would make 7,000 a month.  I know that wouldn't be close to the American Dream's income but just an example of how effortlessly money can grow without even touching the initial amount.  When you factor thousands of those $1,000,000's invested at a much higher gain, again you're making money without doing anything.  It's then that I believe hard-working, intelligent, powerful individuals turn to simply power hungry individuals or families that also have a lot of money.  Driven by power with a \"I only win if you lose\" mindset is a common theme most for a lot of people mentioned in this post. Then the \"with more power comes more responsibilities\" cliche comes into play.  Some have lots of money but give away plenty to not only charities but to invest in other small business to grow the world's economy.  That's a win-win.  However, most become so set on winning that they have to tear others down. like buying a company and selling it for scraps, thousands of employees then lose their job, instead of investing in a potentially profitable company to keep and actually create jobs. TldrCapitalism is awesome for 99% of small to medium sized business.  It's how you compete and make a profit.  Econ 101.  But this way of business, especially those running large companies/dynasties, have to have morals- a goal to grow the business and family wealth by competing, but also investing in areas or hiring contractors to do work and creating jobs.  When money and power meet, the number of people with morals start to diminish. Tldr:I wish I was rich...Edit: fucked up on math my bad.

Thousands protested in response and Catalan leader Puigedemont compared the move to the Franco dictatorship.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday announced Madrid would seek to sack Catalonia's regional government, replace its ministers and call for early elections, marking an unprecedented move to take control of the autonomous region following its threat to secede. The decision to trigger Article 155, a never-before-invoked part of the constitution, came after Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont failed to back down from threats to declare independence.\"It was not our wish or intention. It never was,\" Rajoy said. \"But no democratic government can allow the law to be violated.\"Rajoy said he did not seek to dismantle Catalan autonomy, but to \"restore democracy\" and remove the people who had brought it \"outside of the law.\" Rajoy wants to:- Replace Catalonia's senior government officials with his ministers- Call regional elections to be held within six months- Control the region's police force, finances and public mediaRajoy: Not dismantling Catalan autonomyIn response, Puigdemont slammed Rajoy in a speech later on Saturday, saying the steps being taken were \"the worst attack against the institutions and the people of Catalonia since the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco.\"During Franco's 1938-75 rule, Catalan autonomy and identity were suppressed.  The democratic constitution that emerged from dictatorship granted Catalonia a degree of autonomy in 1979.Puigdemont called on the Catalan parliament to meet immediately to debate how best to counter the national government's decision.Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell went so far to accuse Madrid of attempting to carry out a coup.\"Mariano Rajoy has announced a de facto coup d'etat with the goal of ousting a democratically elected government,\" Forcadell said, adding that the decision was \"an authoritarian blow within a member of the European Union.\"Following the announcement, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona to protest Rajoy's plans.They also called for the release of two activists, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, who are in jail awaiting possible sedition charges.Protesters marching in Barcelona (picture-alliance/AP Photo/E. Morenatti)Podemos: 'In shock'Rajoy's conservative Popular Party has a majority in the Senate and most opposition parties support protecting Spanish unity, meaning a vote to invoke Article 155 is likely to pass. A vote is expected by next Friday.However, the left-wing Podemos party slammed Rajoy's announcement and vowed to push the prime minister out of power.\"We are in shock about the suspension of democracy in Catalonia,\" said Pablo Echenique of Podemos.'Return to legality' The unprecedented step of seizing powers from Catalonia's separatist government came after Puigdemont claimed a mandate to declare independence earlier this month.Separatists have urged Puigdemont to declare independence should the government invoke Article 155. But Spain's chief prosecutor said authorities are prepared to charge Puigdemont if he declares independence.'Extreme situation'Since a disputed independence referendum earlier this month, Madrid and Barcelona have been locked in a political crisis, considered the worst since Spain's transition to democracy.\"We tried in every way to avoid a difficult situation, but you will understand that ... we have arrived at an extreme situation,\" Rajoy said at a press conference during an EU summit in Brussels earlier this week. Catalan leaders' actions go \"directly against the basic principles of the European Union, and this is why nobody should be surprised that the leaders of the European Union are supporting the Spanish position,\" he said. Dreams of independencePuigdemont's government has claimed that roughly 90 percent of voters cast their ballots in favor of independence. However, turnout was only 43 percent, with many pro-union Catalans saying they stayed away from the controversial vote.After the vote, Puigdemont offered a symbolic declaration of independence but suspended the divorce process, prompting Rajoy to issue a deadline for clarification on the Catalan government's position.Minutes before Thursday's deadline, Puigdemont refused to depart from his secessionist discourse, instead vowing to advance independence if Rajoy's government were to dismiss talks and trigger Article 155.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 325, "stickied": false, "score": 109, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 27 19:51:17 2017", "ups": 109}, {"body": "Those responsible have been sacked.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 10075, "stickied": false, "score": 101, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 27 22:13:37 2017", "ups": 101}, {"body": "Catalonia is not going to achieve independence.

Thousands protested in response and Catalan leader Puigedemont compared the move to the Franco dictatorship.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday announced Madrid would seek to sack Catalonia's regional government, replace its ministers and call for early elections, marking an unprecedented move to take control of the autonomous region following its threat to secede. The decision to trigger Article 155, a never-before-invoked part of the constitution, came after Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont failed to back down from threats to declare independence.\"It was not our wish or intention. It never was,\" Rajoy said. \"But no democratic government can allow the law to be violated.\"Rajoy said he did not seek to dismantle Catalan autonomy, but to \"restore democracy\" and remove the people who had brought it \"outside of the law.\" Rajoy wants to:- Replace Catalonia's senior government officials with his ministers- Call regional elections to be held within six months- Control the region's police force, finances and public mediaRajoy: Not dismantling Catalan autonomyIn response, Puigdemont slammed Rajoy in a speech later on Saturday, saying the steps being taken were \"the worst attack against the institutions and the people of Catalonia since the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco.\"During Franco's 1938-75 rule, Catalan autonomy and identity were suppressed.  The democratic constitution that emerged from dictatorship granted Catalonia a degree of autonomy in 1979.Puigdemont called on the Catalan parliament to meet immediately to debate how best to counter the national government's decision.Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell went so far to accuse Madrid of attempting to carry out a coup.\"Mariano Rajoy has announced a de facto coup d'etat with the goal of ousting a democratically elected government,\" Forcadell said, adding that the decision was \"an authoritarian blow within a member of the European Union.\"Following the announcement, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona to protest Rajoy's plans.They also called for the release of two activists, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, who are in jail awaiting possible sedition charges.Protesters marching in Barcelona (picture-alliance/AP Photo/E. Morenatti)Podemos: 'In shock'Rajoy's conservative Popular Party has a majority in the Senate and most opposition parties support protecting Spanish unity, meaning a vote to invoke Article 155 is likely to pass. A vote is expected by next Friday.However, the left-wing Podemos party slammed Rajoy's announcement and vowed to push the prime minister out of power.\"We are in shock about the suspension of democracy in Catalonia,\" said Pablo Echenique of Podemos.'Return to legality' The unprecedented step of seizing powers from Catalonia's separatist government came after Puigdemont claimed a mandate to declare independence earlier this month.Separatists have urged Puigdemont to declare independence should the government invoke Article 155. But Spain's chief prosecutor said authorities are prepared to charge Puigdemont if he declares independence.'Extreme situation'Since a disputed independence referendum earlier this month, Madrid and Barcelona have been locked in a political crisis, considered the worst since Spain's transition to democracy.\"We tried in every way to avoid a difficult situation, but you will understand that ... we have arrived at an extreme situation,\" Rajoy said at a press conference during an EU summit in Brussels earlier this week. Catalan leaders' actions go \"directly against the basic principles of the European Union, and this is why nobody should be surprised that the leaders of the European Union are supporting the Spanish position,\" he said. Dreams of independencePuigdemont's government has claimed that roughly 90 percent of voters cast their ballots in favor of independence. However, turnout was only 43 percent, with many pro-union Catalans saying they stayed away from the controversial vote.After the vote, Puigdemont offered a symbolic declaration of independence but suspended the divorce process, prompting Rajoy to issue a deadline for clarification on the Catalan government's position.Minutes before Thursday's deadline, Puigdemont refused to depart from his secessionist discourse, instead vowing to advance independence if Rajoy's government were to dismiss talks and trigger Article 155.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 325, "stickied": false, "score": 112, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 27 19:51:17 2017", "ups": 112}, {"body": "Those responsible have been sacked.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 10075, "stickied": false, "score": 101, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 27 22:13:37 2017", "ups": 101}, {"body": "This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.dw.com/en/spain-announces-intent-to-sack-catalonias-government/a-41059612) reduced by 87%.

So it was only some \"big news.\" Oh, and that 25 minutes? Are they sure about that? Was the call logged? Nope:>The memo read: \"The caller said only that the Cambridge News                   >reporter should call the American Embassy in London for some                   >big news and then hung up.                   >                                      >\"After the word of the President's death was received the reporter           >informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous call and the police informed MI5.             >                                                         >\"The important point is that the call was made, according to MI5 calculations,                  >about 25 minutes before the President was shot.
