God Bless those who serve, God Bless those who founded the great nation known as the U.S.The Fed Gov is guilty (possibly) of : Possibly doing 9/11, false flags (possible), The War on Drugs, The War on Terror, NSA spying, the wikileaks scandal and their two-faceness, bailing the banks out in 2008 or so, using private armies for $$$, many of these priv. armies committed crimes w/ impunity, the fed gov drowned this nation in debt w/ china, iran-contra, water-gate, ATF gun running, the corruption and big money in Washington now, the \"regulation\" of free speech, etc.America's People are slowly starting to lose their patience w/ the all benevolent US FED GOV.If they tried to do this: It would explode into a revolution that would make WW1, WW2, The Civil War and The Revolutionary all War look like child's play.Simply put: no one would stand for it.Go 'ahead freedom hating libs, downvote me.

What I *don't* get is the digging in the heels about gun *control*. How about mental health checks? How about flagging people who buy 33 guns in a year?

I sensed my opportunity was near when we were all gathered around the fire after hours of partying. We were all probably going to pack it in soon. But first, a little puff puff pass. She didn't react well to that. For starters, she got really dopey really fast. Then, she crapped her pants.I don't mean that as a euphemism. She was giggling excessively. Then there was some loud stomach gurgling. Then there was an incredibly loud fart. Then she laughed harder and said \"Oh my God! I crapped my pants!\" she then laughed harder to the point of tears.After she stopped laughing she wandered into the room where some folks were sleeping, flopped onto her sleeping bag and passed out still with a load in her pants.As if this wasn't enough to kill my interest, she woke up the next morning and spent a solid hour getting breakfast, drinking coffee and doing other stuff before she decided to clean herself up. Last, but certainly not least, she just dropped her shit filled panties in the little garbage can next to the sink in the bathroom that most of us were using.

It was a psychology study done at the University I was studying at the time. It was to study the cognitive effects of marijuana use in regular users. I found a post about it on Facebook, and flyers around the campus. I originally thought it was some sort of bait from the University, but I had a friend who was assisting in the research as part of their degree. It was done at a hospital in Australia (where both recreational and medical marijuana is illegal)I first had to perform some reflex tests, as well as a problem solving test (it seemed similar to an IQ test) while not under the influence. I then smoked the weed (it was vaporised for me, I basically inhaled a balloon of smoke), and they shoved me in an MRI to scan my brain. They also took blood samples etc. I was given different strains with different THC levels and a control which had no THC.I did this over the course of two days, where each day they provided lunch (and walked me to a cool garden in the Hospital for it), and also drove me to and from the hospital. I was paid roughly $200 each day (It was about 3 years ago, so give or take ~$50)Embarrassingly, I actually fell asleep in the MRI machine, because they had the air conditioning on full blast, and it was a struggle to even keep my eyes open.

My wife is from a foreign country. We travel a lot. My wife is close to her sister, and they have a rule that whenever my wife returns from a trip, she will call her sister and let her know that we have arrived home safely. On one overseas trip, we had some airline trouble because of weather, and ended up taking *forever* to get home. We travelled for more than 24 hours, and we were exhausted when we got home, at about 2 a.m. We dumped the bags in the living room, just popping them open to dig around for our shower bags. My wife called her sister, and went off to shower. I stripped off to my underwear, popped a beer and sat down in the living room to wait my turn in the shower. There comes a loud hard knock on the front door. **Police! OPEN THE DOOR**I go, beer in hand, and open the door. The policeman, who looks like a crewcutted Alabama State College Football player, looks at me in my underwear, unshaven, long hair a wild mess, beer in hand, and *pushes me* into *my*  living room. He looks at the open suitcases scattered around and eyes me with disgust. I am not amused by him pushing into my house - I\u2019m thinking, *You need a warrant, buddy*, but only say, *What are you doing in my house?*He says, **I want to talk to your wife** I say, honestly, *you can\u2019t; she\u2019s in the shower right now. I\u2019ll tell you whatever you need to know*.The officer blows past me and starts going through my house. **Where is the shower?**  I say, *What do you think you\u2019re doing?* but more wisely upon reflection,add  *It\u2019s in the master bedroom*.  He says, **Take me there**. At the closed bathroom door, he says **Tell her to come out.**  I, stupidly, say, *Can\u2019t this wait till morning?* He puts his hand on his gun. So...*[Mrs. Ameobanot], honey I need you to come out here.* She fiddles for a minute, and opens the bathroom door, sees the cop, and *screams!* and slams the bathroom door.  The cop draws his gun and points it at me! **Tell her to come out. She\u2019s safe now!**It seems that my wife was so exhausted that instead of dialing 011 for an international call, she dialed 911...about 4 or 5 times. She said that she knew she misdialed somehow because somebody kept speaking English to her, but she\u2019d just hang up and dial again. Eventually she got it right and talked to her sister. Never thought about it and never mentioned it to me.However, some good 911 operator only knew that somebody kept trying to call 911 , saying something unintelligible (hello in her native language) and *something, somebody* kept making her hang up. They sent a cop, who saw a drunk wife beater in his underwear with a bunch of scattered suitcases obviously belonging to a wife he wouldn\u2019t let leave him.TL/DR: My wife misdialed 911 5 times at 2 a.m. and damn near got me shot in my own bedroom by a cop.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 44134, "stickied": false, "score": 986, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 20:26:47 2017", "ups": 986}, {"body": "McDonald's took the McRib off the menu...again, what do I do?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1896, "stickied": false, "score": 549, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 16:09:00 2017", "ups": 549}, {"body": "Ive been a user for over 5 years.

I must admit, I find the premise somewhat flawed. I've been diagnosed with depression by multiple people, I'm on anti-depressants, I've been to therapy, all that fun stuff. But I always thought the major problem with all of these things is that it treats our sadness or the thoughts of people with depression as something secondary, something meaningless, as though our experiences in life, our worries, our cultural pressures and environments, mean nothing in relation to our mental state. As though we are just a bunch of dead grey matter being prodded by chemicals, suffering endlessly for no reason. I'm not denying science, but I think a major misconception about psychology (one largely driven by pharmaceutical corporation funding to universities and propaganda producing psychiatric think tanks, fyi) is that the thoughts of a mentally ill person are fundamentally irrational, and that somehow they need to be \"fixed\". No, I'm depressed for very clear, very obvious reasons. Everyone is, even if they have a hard time putting it into words. There are legitimate roots to all of our pain. Much of it societal, based around expectations we could not meet or our inability to connect emotionally with others. It's never one thing, but it certainly is *something*. So it is that the advice in these threads is normally some mixture of \"go on prozac\" and some sort of self help routine based around distractions. \"Make yourself a cup of tea/play a game/paint\". All that might be well and good. I like tea and painting and prozac helps. But it is not a \"cure\" by any means. Mainly because I'm not actually sick, the way I define it. Eccentric and prone to bouts of nigh apocalyptic feelings of dread? Oh yeah. But \"sick\"? No, I'm me. And looking back I realize a major problem I always had was picturing myself as somebody \"broken\" rather than as a human being. I spent a massive chunk of my life perceiving myself as something less than human. A pathetic, sniveling, disgusting vermin that should be exterminated. Not a person but a *creature*. Some hideous thing that crawled out of genetic muck one day and spent the next couple decades slithering all over planet Earth like a toxic oil slick. Polluting everything it touched. A major source of that attitude was the idea that whoever \"I\" was was not who I was supposed to be, that I was supposed to be *somebody else*. A better looking, smarter, kinder, more confident, harder working, rich, perfect ubermensch. I suppose sooner or later, gradually, I learned to have compassion for myself. And that is what most people are lacking. Our society *encourages* self loathing. We are a culture built on competition, one against the other, dog eat dog, \"fuck you I got mine\". A culture who's standards of success are fundamentally unreachable. A consumer society where the only thing that keeps us buying (and thus the world running) is a deluge of advertisements and mass psychological manipulations that are meant to convince us that our lives are worthless without \"something else\". Usually something we need to pay for. And then once we get it we realize we still have nothing. Perhaps I'm fine and it's the world that's fucked? Maybe a bleak attitude to some. But I'm sure if most people looked down into the roots of their own unhappiness they'd see the same things as everybody else. Loneliness, a sense that they're \"lacking\" something, a desire for a life and a world that is not theirs and can never be. How often have you been told you're worth less than shit because you don't have a hollywood esque shallow nothing of a life? The hot girlfriend and nice car and money and perfect job? But even more broadly you'd be amazed at how society can also make us feel bad for feeling bad. As though feeling sad in the utopia capitalism likes to present itself as is some sort of treason against goodness. It's particularly American, I must say. Hating yourself for hating yourself, being sad for being sad, a never ending feedback loop where all we can do is obsess over our own suffering, never being able to find a way out. So again, I try to have compassion for myself. I am a flawed, strange, man. I do not want to be anything else. And it is my problems that make me a human being. I am very happy I get to be sad. It keeps me grounded. It reminds me to look inward, and it clears away all the junk and delusions I build. And then in the empty space I find the time to appreciate the people in my life and the things that I have, even if by most people's standards I don't have much. OP, you don't need a treatment. Everybody else does.

I cover several things here - they are separated into different paragraphs. These are:- Police brutality- Legality (Illegality) of referendum- Oppression of Catalan people- Corruption of Spanish government- Money/Politics- PatriotismThere are a couple of things to understand with this - it's not a simple issue. For starters, everything surrounding the police brutality. I don't think it should be taken as a symbol of Spanish oppression. Spanish police officers are, by and large, absolute dicks. They're violent and not usually particularly concerned about rules. (For any police officers here, I'm just stating the general stereotype, not launching an attack on the Spanish police). It's a problem around Spain, not just something surfacing during these protests.Regarding the referendum. It was illegal, to start. Puidgemot's party had to have a three party coalition that all supported a referendum. He then floated this idea in the Catalan parliament, and all the government members voted. Despite his three party coalition, the vote didn't actually pass, but Puidgemot decided to hold the vote anyway, hence its illegality. This is one of the main reasons I hate the Catalan independence group. They protest and whinge about the oppression of rights and the harshness of the Spanish government, but then don't respect the law if it applies to them.Oppression of the Catalan people. Spain was under a dictatorship for many years. Under Franco, the Catalonians were brutally subjugated and marginalised. This started to generate much of the anti-Madrid sentiment that they have now.Corruption. Corruption in the Spanish government system is rampant. We currently have the PP in power, who have been involved in a greater number of corruption scandals than Donald Trump. Their protests about corruption are well founded, but this is a pronto around Spain, not just affecting Catalonia. This corruption is also a lingering remnant of the old dictatorship, something that will eventually pass. Equally important is to note the fact that the Catalan 'government' is anything but corruption free itself. They have had their own plague of accusations of corruption.Money/PoliticsDeclaring independence is silly. Spain would build a massive highway system bypassing the Catalonian region. Tariffs would be imposed between Catalonia and Spain. Surprise, surprise, trading between Catalonia and Spain is tariff free at the moment. In addition, they would take a while to become a part of the European Union. It would be a pain, and the newly formed country would probably suffer extreme economic distress for decades. In addition, the corruption and blatant disregard for the common law from puidgemot and his cronies suggests to me that it might not be a good idea to just hand them a lot of power.Lastly, most of the catalonians want to declare independence because of their patriotism. I understand patriotism, but I feel that they should feel patriotic about being part of a greater good, of being part of the Spanish empire that once ruled most of the world (let's gloss over the extermination of the aztecs and incas). Spain is a fantastic, multicultural country. It has people of every ethnicity, and its history is extensive and fascinating. Catalonia has been a part of that history for hundreds of years now, and it would be a shame to lose them.For any Catalans here. Entiendo lo que sent\u00eds. Realmente entiendo que est\u00e1is hartos del gobierno espa\u00f1ol. Yo tambi\u00e9n. Es una puta mierda. Pero arregl\u00e9moslo juntos. Ahora no es la hora para la divisi\u00f3n.

Personally I am in full support of their want to become independent but like a lot of people am unsure of whether or not I support its legality/legitimacy. The way that it was explained to me the other day was that it was illegal because 1. It's in their constitution that no autonomous region can try to separate (which I mean, like, I'm okay with this law being changed because if a majority of the people want it and vote to pass it, then it should pass because this is a democracy) and 2. The vote was held on a Sunday, and polling places were in government buildings which by law are closed on Sundays. Hence the barricades and whatnot. I'm sure there are a lot more facets to each side of the argument but from what I can gather these are two of the biggest reasons people are against it. Here in the south, people generally are very traditional. They're proud of the Spanish culture in almost every single way imaginable. That being said, the older generation here seems to be in stark opposition to it- there are Spanish flags (a sign of the anti-separatist side) everywhere. However, from the people I've talked to over the past few weeks, younger people seem to be more supportive of the idea in general. Obviously it's an extremely complex issue and its ramifications, good or bad, couldn't really be measured until we see how it plays out first hand which unfortunately probably won't happen even though the vote technically passed.

Even the pope said that all spanish people should vote in that referendum.  I got to say that 90% of the population voted yes for that constitution at the time (1978)  Nonetheless, the funniest thing is that the catalunians say that the constitution was made to screw them. What they don't tell you is that, where the constitution was supported the most was in Catalu\u00f1a.The creator of CIU which is the most voted party that support the independence is Jordi Pujol.

They are still judging them.My theory is that since they are going to remove the bank secrecy in Andorra in the coming years, and obviously they are full of shit,  the only way to get away with it is by being majority in its own country.

Forensic testing counts the number of repeats in these regions and compares it to a sample they collected from a crime scene.

The major consumer DNA testing companies will look at only a small subset of markers in your DNA that are known to be *highly polymorphic*, meaning that they are likely to vary between people, often referred to as *genotyping*. This will be on the order of hundreds of thousands to several million positions (out of 3 billion in your entire genome). How do we know where the differences between people are likely to be? There have been efforts in recent years to sample DNA from people from many all around the world and store it in publicly available databases - the two biggest projects are called HapMap and 1000 Genomes. Companies such as 23andme and ancestry.com are also continually collecting such data and building their databases. From these, it is possible to look at these DNA markers and see: which are the markers that appear in certain ethnic groups way more often than in others? (Note: When we talk about groups/populations here, we mean groups of people living and breeding with each other, different from what geographic/political borders may be.)Ultimately, this means that when you want to know what your ancestry is, they can take your DNA data and compare it to the previously collected data and see: do you have markers that are known to belong to specific populations? The more closely your DNA matches patterns observed earlier, the more confident your assignment will be. Of course the major caveat here is that your ethnicity prediction is only as good as the data available. Most available (in most fields of human genetics) comes from European populations, so you may be  able to get a more precise answer if you are European than Asian.

This might get into the weeds a little bit but...Essentially, your DNA is fixed onto a slide, and that slide is washed with bases (A, T, C,  and G) which are all dyed a different color. These bases pair up with each other (T with A and G with C). So they let the dyed base pairs line up with your DNA and then take a picture. If they detect the dye for A, they know that A must have bound to a T in your DNA, so they mark a \"T\" for that position. And they move down the line like that. From there they enter your sequence into a database where they compare it to other sequences similar to how idrequired220 described. A decade ago this used to take years, now it takes about a day!

To determine the maximum safe charging current, some batteries will include a \"c rating.\" The maximum charging current will be equal to the charge of the battery times the c rating.

Current is completely dependent on the voltage so it's not like you can just say charge it at 250mA as there is only 1 voltage that will be supplied at with any given load(and as the battery charges this voltage is continuously increasing as well to maintain that charge rate). If the voltage is lower than this point you will get less charge current and if the voltage is higher you will get a higher current(assuming the charger is capable of it). Lets say you have a mostly dead li-ion battery, it may read 3v or 3.2v. If it is a 250mA charger then the voltage the charger has to put out to dump that much current into it would only be around 0.1v higher than the battery at any given time throughout the charge. The higher the charge current is the higher this voltage difference will be. This trend continues all the way until the battery reaches a certain voltage(probably around 4V) at which point the charger will put out a constant 4.2V and the charge current will get drastically reduced until the battery reaches that same voltage and no more current will flow into the battery. This reason is why getting proper battery chargers is so important they do all the fancy stuff for you.you can't just hook up 4.2V to a li-ion battery though. If you attempted to do that with a flat battery it will draw excessive current and may catch on fire. Eventually the charger will put out that voltage to charge the battery but depending how dead the battery is will depend on what voltage it gets charged at.  To answer your question though, it could take longer or shorter depending on a few factors. A battery may have a capacity of 3000mAh but almost no device actually fully discharges batteries. so what you consider a dead battery may have only used up 2500mAh and only that capacity is what will need to be recharged so it could take less time. However it could also take longer due to the fact it doesn't supply that charge current from 0%-100%. if it did then it would be close but the last bit of capacity will be charged at a much lower charge current so while 90% may get done in 10.8 hours the last 10% would take longer than the expected 1.2 hours. This is the reason you see marketing saying thing like 80% charge in 30 minutes or whatever other phrasing they use in those quick charge advertisements. It's better than saying 100% in 1 hour, to most people that 80% in half the total charge time is far more important than the top 20% which may extend charge time by double.

One amp is equal to one coulomb per second (which basically means it's a measure of the number of electrons passing by every second), so one coulomb is equal to an amp-second. Showing charge in this way helps us quickly see how to charge the battery.The other thing to know is that your charger should show amps, not mAh. I'm guessing you meant a 250 mA power supply.Now it's just unit conversions. 3000 mAh / 250 mA = 12 hours.So you were mostly right.If 12 hours seems impractically long, you can charge at a higher amperage. To determine the maximum safe charging current, some batteries will include a \"c rating.\" The maximum charging current will be equal to the charge of the battery times the c rating.

It tends to shorten battery life (best case scenario)  or cause your battery to over temp and catch fire (worst case scenario) That being said, a 250mA charger should charge a 3000 mAh battery in about 12 hours.  It may reach full charge in a little less or a little more time than that,  depending on a number of variables,  including whether or not your charge actually maxes out at 250mA, and what the state of charge curve looks like for your battery.

Current is completely dependent on the voltage so it's not like you can just say charge it at 250mA as there is only 1 voltage that will be supplied at with any given load(and as the battery charges this voltage is continuously increasing as well to maintain that charge rate). If the voltage is lower than this point you will get less charge current and if the voltage is higher you will get a higher current(assuming the charger is capable of it). Lets say you have a mostly dead li-ion battery, it may read 3v or 3.2v. If it is a 250mA charger then the voltage the charger has to put out to dump that much current into it would only be around 0.1v higher than the battery at any given time throughout the charge. The higher the charge current is the higher this voltage difference will be. This trend continues all the way until the battery reaches a certain voltage(probably around 4V) at which point the charger will put out a constant 4.2V and the charge current will get drastically reduced until the battery reaches that same voltage and no more current will flow into the battery. This reason is why getting proper battery chargers is so important they do all the fancy stuff for you.you can't just hook up 4.2V to a li-ion battery though. If you attempted to do that with a flat battery it will draw excessive current and may catch on fire. Eventually the charger will put out that voltage to charge the battery but depending how dead the battery is will depend on what voltage it gets charged at.  To answer your question though, it could take longer or shorter depending on a few factors. A battery may have a capacity of 3000mAh but almost no device actually fully discharges batteries. so what you consider a dead battery may have only used up 2500mAh and only that capacity is what will need to be recharged so it could take less time. However it could also take longer due to the fact it doesn't supply that charge current from 0%-100%. if it did then it would be close but the last bit of capacity will be charged at a much lower charge current so while 90% may get done in 10.8 hours the last 10% would take longer than the expected 1.2 hours. This is the reason you see marketing saying thing like 80% charge in 30 minutes or whatever other phrasing they use in those quick charge advertisements. It's better than saying 100% in 1 hour, to most people that 80% in half the total charge time is far more important than the top 20% which may extend charge time by double.

The action followed an earlier effort by Interior to postpone part of the rule set to to take effect next year.U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte of the Northern District of California said Interior had failed to give a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d for the changes and had not offered details why an earlier analysis by the Obama administration was faulty.

It offers a rare glimpse into how the intelligence community thinks Russian intelligence exploits a widely available commercial software product to spy on the U.S.The incident occurred in 2015 but wasn\u2019t discovered until spring of last year, said the people familiar with the matter.The stolen material included details about how the NSA penetrates foreign computer networks, the computer code it uses for such spying and how it defends networks inside the U.S., these people said.Having such information could give the Russian government information on how to protect its own networks, making it more difficult for the NSA to conduct its work. It also could give the Russians methods to infiltrate the networks of the U.S. and other nations, these people said.The breach is the first known incident in which Kaspersky software is believed to have been exploited by Russian hackers to conduct espionage against the U.S. government. The company, which sells its antivirus products in the U.S., had revenue of more than half a billion dollars in Western Europe and the Americas in 2016, according to International Data Corp. By Kaspersky\u2019s own account it has more than 400 million users world-wide.The revelation comes as concern over Russian infiltration of American computer networks and social media platforms is growing amid a U.S. special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign sought or received assistance from the Russian government. Mr. Trump denies any impropriety and has called the matter a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dIntelligence officials have concluded that a campaign authorized by the highest levels of the Russian government hacked into state election-board systems and the email networks of political organizations to damage the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.A spokesman for the NSA didn\u2019t comment on the security breach. \u201cWhether the information is credible or not, NSA\u2019s policy is never to comment on affiliate or personnel matters,\u201d he said. He noted that the Defense Department, of which the NSA is a part, has a contract for antivirus software with another company, not Kaspersky.In a statement, Kaspersky Lab said it \u201chas not been provided any information or evidence substantiating this alleged incident, and as a result, we must assume that this is another example of a false accusation.\u201dKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov in a statement didn\u2019t address whether the Russian government stole materials from the NSA using Kaspersky software. But he criticized the U.S. government\u2019s decision to ban the software from use by U.S. agencies as \u201cundermining the competitive positions of Russian companies on the world arena.\u201dThe Kaspersky incident is the third publicly known breach at the NSA involving a contractor\u2019s access to a huge trove of highly classified materials. It prompted an official letter of reprimand to the agency\u2019s director, Adm. Michael Rogers, by his superiors, people familiar with the situation said.Adm. Rogers came into his post in 2014 promising to staunch leaks after the disclosure that NSA contractor Edward Snowden the year before gave classified documents to journalists that revealed surveillance programs run by the U.S. and allied nations.The Kaspersky-linked incident predates the arrest last year of another NSA contractor, Harold Martin, who allegedly removed massive amounts of classified information from the agency\u2019s headquarters and kept it at his home, but wasn\u2019t thought to have shared the data.Mr. Martin pleaded not guilty to charges that include stealing classified information. His lawyer has said he took the information home only to get better at his job and never intended to reveal secrets.The name of the NSA contractor in the Kaspersky-related incident and the company he worked for aren\u2019t publicly known. People familiar with the matter said he is thought to have purposely taken home numerous documents and other materials from NSA headquarters, possibly to continue working beyond his normal office hours.The man isn\u2019t believed to have wittingly worked for a foreign government, but knew that removing classified information without authorization is a violation of NSA policies and potentially a criminal act, said people with knowledge of the breach.It is unclear whether he has been dismissed from his job or faces charges. The incident remains under federal investigation, said people familiar with the matter.Kaspersky software once was authorized for use by nearly two dozen U.S. government agencies, including the Army, Navy and Air Force, and the departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, Energy, Veterans Affairs, Justice and Treasury.NSA employees and contractors never had been authorized to use Kaspersky software at work. While there was no prohibition against these employees or contractors using it at home, they were advised not to before the 2015 incident, said people with knowledge of the guidance the agency gave.For years, U.S. national security officials have suspected that Kaspersky Lab, founded by a computer scientist who was trained at a KGB-sponsored technical school, is a proxy of the Russian government, which under Russian law can compel the company\u2019s assistance in intercepting communications as they move through Russian computer networks.Kaspersky said in its statement: \u201cAs a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts.\u201dSuspicions about the company prompted the Department of Homeland Security last month to take the extraordinary step of banning all U.S. government departments and agencies from using Kaspersky products and services. Officials determined that \u201cmalicious cyber actors\u201d could use the company\u2019s antivirus software to gain access to a computer\u2019s files, said people familiar with the matter.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4558, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 21:00:01 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "This is why we told you not to elect Donald Trump, people.

This was a definition of feminism I offered in Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center more than 10 years ago. It was my hope at the time that it would become a common definition everyone would use. I liked this definition because it did not imply that men were the enemy. By naming sexism as the problem it went directly to the heart of the matter. Practically, it is a definition which implies that all sexist thinking and action is the problem, whether those who perpetuate it are female or male, child or adult. It is also broad enough to include an understanding of systemic institutionalized sexism. As a definition it is open-ended. To understand feminism it implies one has to necessarily understand sexism.As all advocates of feminist politics know, most people do not understand sexism, or if they do, they think it is not a problem. Masses of people think that feminism is always and only about women seeking to be equal to men. And a huge majority of these folks think feminism is anti-male. Their misunderstanding of feminist politics reflects the reality that most folks learn about feminism from patriarchal mass media. The feminism they hear about the most is portrayed by women who are primarily committed to gender equality - equal pay for equal work, and sometimes women and men sharing household chores and parenting. They see that these women are usually white and materially privileged. They know from mass media that women\u2019s liberation focuses on the freedom to have abortions, to be lesbians, to challenge rape and domestic violence.Among these issues, masses of people agree with the idea of gender equity in the workplace - equal pay for equal work.Since our society continues to be primarily a \u201cChristian\u201d culture, masses of people continue to believe that god has ordained that women be subordinate to men in the domestic household. Even though masses of women have entered the workforce, even though many families are headed by women who are the sole breadwinners, the vision of domestic life which continues to dominate the nation\u2019s imagination is one in which the logic of male domination is intact, whether men are present in the home or not. The wrong minded notion of feminist movement which implied it was anti-male carried with it the wrong-minded assumption that all female space would necessarily be an environment where patriarchy and sexist thinking would be absent. Many women, even those involved in feminist politics, chose to believe this as well.There was indeed a great deal of anti-male sentiment among early feminist activists who were responding to male domination with anger. It was that anger at injustice that was the impetus for creating a women\u2019s liberation movement. Early on most feminist activists (a majority of whom were white) had their consciousness raised about the nature of male domination when they were working in anti-classist and anti-racist settings with men who were telling the world about the importance of freedom while subordinating the women in their ranks. Whether it was white women working on behalf of socialism, black women working on behalf of civil rights and black liberation, or Native American women working for indigenous rights, it was clear that men wanted to lead, and they wanted women to follow. Participating in these radical freedom struggles awakened the spirit of rebellion and resistance in progressive females and led them towards contemporary women\u2019s liberation.As contemporary feminism progressed, as women realized that males were not the only group in our society who supported sexist thinking and behavior - that females could be sexist as well - anti-male sentiment no longer shaped the movement\u2019s consciousness. The focus shifted to an all-out effort to create gender justice. But women could not band together to further feminism without confronting our sexist thinking. Sisterhood could not be powerful as long as women were competitively at war with one another. Utopian visions of sisterhood based solely on the awareness of the reality that all women were in some way victimized by male domination were disrupted by discussions of class and race. Discussions of class differences occurred early on in contemporary feminism, preceding discussions of race. Diana Press published revolutionary insights about class divisions between women as early as the mid-\u201870s in their collection of essays Class and Feminism. These discussions did not trivialize the feminist insistence that \u201csisterhood is powerful,\u201d they simply emphasized that we could only become sisters in struggle by confronting the ways women - through sex, class, and race - dominated and exploited other women, and created a political platform that would address these differences.Even though individual black women were active in contemporary feminist movement from its inception, they were not the individuals who became the \u201cstars\u201d of the movement, who attracted the attention of mass media. Often individual black women active in feminist movement were revolutionary feminists (like many white lesbians). They were already at odds with reformist feminists who resolutely wanted to project a vision of the movement as being solely about women gaining equality with men in the existing system. Even before race became a talked about issue in feminist circles it was clear to black women (and to their revolutionary allies in struggle) that they were never going to have equality within the existing white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.From its earliest inception feminist movement was polarized. Reformist thinkers chose to emphasize gender equality. Revolutionary thinkers did not want simply to alter the existing system so that women would have more rights. We wanted to transform that system, to bring an end to patriarchy and sexism. Since patriarchal mass media was not interested in the more revolutionary vision, it never received attention in mainstream press. The vision of \u201cwomen\u2019s liberation\u201d which captured and still holds the public imagination was the one representing women as wanting what men had. And this was the vision that was easier to realize. Changes in our nation\u2019s economy, economic repression, the loss of jobs, etc., made the climate ripe for our nation\u2019s citizens to accept the notion of gender equality in the workforce.Given the reality of racism, it made sense that white men were more willing to consider women\u2019s rights when the granting of those rights could serve the interests of maintaining white supremacy.We can never forget that white women began to assert their need for freedom after civil rights, just at the point when racial discrimination was ending and black people, especially black males, might have attained equality in the workforce with white men. Reformist feminist thinking focusing primarily on equality with men in the workforce overshadowed the original radical foundations of contemporary feminism which called for reform as well as overall restructuring of society so that our nation would be fundamentally anti-sexist.Most women, especially privileged white women, ceased even to consider revolutionary feminist visions, once they began to gain economic power within the existing social structure. Ironically, revolutionary feminist thinking was most accepted and embraced in academic circles. In those circles the production of revolutionary feminist theory progressed, but more often than not that theory was not made available to the public. It became and remains a privileged discourse available to those among us who are highly literate, well-educated, and usually materially privileged. Works like Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center that offer a liberatory vision of feminist transformation never receive mainstream attention. Masses of people have not heard of this book. They have not rejected its message; they do not know what the message is.While it was in the interest of mainstream white supremacist capitalist patriarchy to suppress visionary feminist thinking which was not anti-male or concerned with getting women the right to be like men, reformist feminists were also eager to silence these forces. Reformist feminism became their route to class mobility. They could break free of male domination in the workforce and be more self-determining in their lifestyles. While sexism did not end, they could maximize their freedom within the existing system. And they could count on there being a lower class of exploited subordinated women to do the dirty work they were refusing to do. By accepting and indeed colluding with the subordination of working-class and poor women, they not only ally themselves with the existing patriarchy and its concomitant sexism, they give themselves the right to lead a double life, one where they are the equals of men in the workforce and at home when they want to be. If they choose lesbianism they have the privilege of being equals with men in the workforce while using class power to create domestic lifestyles where they can choose to have little or no contact with men.Lifestyle feminism ushered in the notion that there could be as many versions of feminism as there were women. Suddenly the politics was being slowly removed from feminism. And the assumption prevailed that no matter what a woman\u2019s politics, be she conservative or liberal, she too could fit feminism into her existing lifestyle. Obviously this way of thinking has made feminism more acceptable because its underlying assumption is that women can be feminists without fundamentally challenging and changing themselves or the culture. For example, let\u2019s take the issue of abortion. If feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression, and depriving females of reproductive rights is a form of sexist oppression, then one cannot be anti-choice and be feminist. A woman can insist she would never choose to have an abortion while affirming her support of the right of women to choose and still be an advocate of feminist politics. She cannot be anti-abortion and an advocate of feminism. Concurrently there can be no such thing as \u201cpower feminism\u201d if the vision of power evoked is power gained through the exploitation and oppression of others.Feminist politics is losing momentum because feminist movement has lost clear definitions. We have those definitions. Let\u2019s reclaim them. Let\u2019s share them. Let\u2019s start over. Let\u2019s have T-shirts and bumper stickers and postcards and hip-hop music, television and radio commercials, ads everywhere and billboards, and all manner of printed material that tells the world about feminism. We can share the simple yet powerful message that feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression. Let\u2019s start there. Let the movement begin again.\"", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "74ekcz", "gilded": 0, "stickied": true, "title": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 2: \"Feminist politics - where we stand\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000)", "num_comments": 1, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 692, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/74ekcz/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_2_feminist_politics/", "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 12:07:48 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "**[Part 1 - Come closer to feminism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/73yq84/hooked_on_bell_hooks_come_closer_to_feminism_from/)**", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 23, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 12:09:11 2017", "ups": 2}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74ekcz/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_2_feminist_politics/", "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "I'm grateful to see articles like this reach a broader audience.

Another man with a cane and I were the last to board a fairly packed bus. Once on, nobody made any move to let us get towards priority handicapped seating.  I was concerned because the bus was about to leave the bay, and I was not coordinated enough to stand while the bus was in motion.  Nobody else on the bus had an obvious disability, so we should have been allowed to sit without even having to ask; \"Passengers are expected to give up their seats to people with disability\". Doesn't even mention that the rule is limited to passengers seated in priority seats--it applies universally.  Bus drivers just can't force anyone *not* in a priority seat to move for a person with a disability.  This route also happens to be on the way to, you guessed it, the hospital, at rush hour, with a bus full of regulars who all know the protocol and are trying to avoid looking at me and my new bus bro.I forget what I said exactly, but I had to speak up over the din of the crowded bus and ask for two people in the priority seating area to stand up for me and the man with the cane.  I actually had to ask twice because the first time I asked, only one person stood up, near me, and I wanted to give the seat to him but I was closest so I just said something like, \"well that's one, but we need two because there's two of us who need seats, can we get one more seat for this man\" and finally someone else stood.  The bus driver also considerately waited for the man with the cane to confirm that he was safely seated before hitting the gas (a rare courtesy in my recent experience).

The father skipped town and went to America with his brothers when he found out (didn't tell his brothers). She had the baby, put it into foster care, then decided she wanted him. So she went home and said \"mom dad I've something to tell you\" and my granny described it as saying \"oh no, you're pregnant\" and then finding out, \"nope worse, I had the baby, here's his picture\". True story the fathers parents lived down the road, so my granny and grandad marched right down to his mother, who called his brohers, who proceeded to punch him, load him onto the first plane home and then they got married. (Still married, had 2 more kids, they're actually very happy together??) Second: My mom got pregnant and told her parents straight away. She was also going to give the child up for adoption. Just before she had the baby she went to visit my grandparents and they refused to speak to her or see her. She then realized that no matter what she did they wouldn't have anything to do with her so she decided to keep the baby. (She had a well i'm already dead to them, may as well be dead and have cute baby). She was in her final year of her nursing degree. She had to repeat the last semester as she had my sister right before final exams. She worked her butt off and it was hard, she got kicked out of her accommodation for being an unwed mother. But after a year or two my grandparents came around and all was well. She's always said her degree is what really helped her out though.And finally a friends mother. She was in London, she had the baby and gave it up for adoption. Her family still doesn't know, and my friend only found out she had a secret sibling when she was 21. Seriously she's visited her eldest since and they've a nice-ish relationship now but she's taking that secret to the grave. Her eldest isn't allowed to come and visit her Ireland and my friend isn't allowed to mention her to the extended family. I hope these stories help a bit. If you're keeping it I'd suggest telling your parents. Honestly the sooner the better. Probably over the phone since if they decide to come over It gives you time to prepare. Also either get the paternity test or tell them the father has fecked off. But do not tell them there's two potential daddys!!!! But also if you want to give the baby up, you need to start organizing that now, you know picking out the nice families and stuff. From what I know they like the kids fresh out of the oven.

When my ultra conservative Indian parents find out I am pregnant, they will immediately:1. Come to England2. Kill me3. Find out who the father is (actually, this would be quite useful), if necessary by DNA testing the whole of London 4. Kill him5. Drag my twitching corpse back to India and force me to marry some fucking annoying Indian guy with awful taste in shirts. 6. Bring up the baby themselves while I finish my degree literally shackled to a desk, to ensure I can\u2019t bring any more great shame on the family. Problem 3. Oh yeah, did I mention. I don\u2019t know who the father is. Ok there\u2019s only two possibilities! Don\u2019t judge me - I\u2019m a student and we have sex sometimes. I just happened to get very lucky twice in one week. And if you\u2019re thinking how irresponsible it was not to take precautions, I fucking did, ok. We used condoms, but we were drunk and I guess something leaked past. Now stop going on about it. I have waddled past both guys around campus a few times, but neither has stopped me to say \u2018hi\u2019 or \u2018how are you\u2019 or \u2018fuck, you\u2019re pregnant, it\u2019s not mine is it?\u2019. They are both blissfully ignorant of their impending fate. Problem 4. Since about week 23 my sex drive has got batshit crazy, but because I look like a waddling Indian whale no guy wants to have sex with me probably because they\u2019re worried if they get too close they\u2019ll fall over my gravitational event horizon and be unable to escape. This is a shame because my tits look amazing, and nobody is getting to admire them. Problem 5. I have zero idea what I\u2019m going to do after the baby is born. I\u2019m a fourth year medical student. I have made absolutely no plans. My medical training so far tells me that in about 15 weeks a baby is going to pop out of my vagina and probably want some attention. What am I doing to do? I haven\u2019t the first idea. Take a year off studying? Give baby for adoption? Sell it on eBay? My rating isn\u2019t that great - I once sold a guy a broken hoover. Could be a problem. I know I know I need to grow up, face reality and get a grip. Here is my plan:1. Find out who the father is. I\u2019m going to have to ask them both to do paternity tests. That\u2019ll be fun. 2. Have sex with him. (Wishful thinking, probably.)3. Find out whether he wants to be a father. Because loads of undergraduate student guys are just itching to become dads, right? Probably should also warn him that my parents will murder him, definitely, and that he might want to buy a disguise. 4. Tell my parents that despite obviously being a virgin, I have somehow become pregnant. 5. Go into hiding. I don\u2019t really need advice. I know what I have to do. But somebody send me some solidarity! Everyone assumes I have this impending situation totally under control, whereas in reality I\u2019ve just been pretending it isn\u2019t going to happen!

Things were going great until about month 5 or so, when Alex started getting busier and busier with his demanding work schedule. I kept trying to make plans, he kept putting them off, citing his crazy difficult work projects as an excuse. I hadn't seen him for a month, but he finally found the time for me last Monday night. We hung out, but it was....weird. Awkward. I felt uncomfortable around him and was wishing I just stayed home the whole night.    I sensed things were off, so I asked him if we could have a conversation about something serious. It was late and he told me he was too tired to talk, and we could talk about it later. We went to bed. On Wednesday we finally had the dreaded conversation. I asked things like \"What are we?\" and \"do you think we have a future together?\". Valid questions, I think, to ask someone when you've been \"together\" for 6 months. He told me he was too busy and not ready for a relationship, but he was also confused about his feelings so he asked for a day to think things over. I gave it to him.He called me on Thursday to end things. I was crushed, but at the same time I had also seen this coming so I was prepared, and also a little relieved, considering how shitty the past month of our \"relationship\" had been. It's Friday, so I figure I'm gonna stop pitying myself and hang out with one of my best friends, Dan. He just moved into a new place with his roommate, Brandon. They have a hot tub, so I was excited to relax, have a couple beers, and try to forget about things. Dan went to bed, and I found myself hanging out alone with Brandon. We had an amazing time, I was cracking up laughing for hours, we stayed up until like 5 am. I slept with Brandon, the sex was amazing!! I feel like I connected more with Brandon in 6 hours than I had with Alex in 6 months. I was questioning why I even dated Alex in the first place.I'm not sure if I regret the night with Brandon. I was single for literally less than 24 hours and had already slept with someone new. I was raised pretty conservative, so obviously I'm a slut, right? But I was technically single so does that make things ok? To make things worse, Brandon and Alex are friends. Should I feel guilty about how Alex is going to feel when he finds out?To be clear, I didn't do this out of revenge. I still think Alex is a good person and I don't want to hurt him. I just genuinely felt a connection to Brandon and impulsively acted on it. Brandon and I are still texting, should I pursue this? Or should I just cut contact and swear off men for a while until I figure my shit out? If anyone actually takes the time to read this, thank you so much.

Yesterday I was sexually harrased, not for the first time but I remember what I was thinking the whole time and I know that my thoughts are the thoughts of many women in the same situation - I want to share them, because they are wrong.It happened in the train. It was quite full but not as crowded as it could be. The seat near me was free and I was in one of those trains that don't have arm pillows between the seats. So a guy asked if he could sit next to me, he was really strange, only whispered but what ever... I don't want to judge people so easily. So it was a three people seat, I was at the right seat next to the window, another woman was at the left side so this guy sat in the middle. I noticed right away that he was really close, so close that his whole side touched me and his elbow was on my knee. I'm extremely anxious when it comes to body contact with strangers, I need my personal space or I will panic. So there was this guy nearly sitting on top of me and I was horrified.I thought that it was just me overreacting. It's a full train, right? There's probably just not enough space for him. For everyone else this wouldn't be uncomfortable, it's probably just me. So I didn't said anything. I texted a friend to calm down but I coud barely move my hands, this guy was so close that he pressed me against the window and I was pretty much unable to move. I tried to give him a little push with my elbow just hard enough for him to notice that I felt uncomfortable, so that he could eventually make himself a little smaller. Nothing. I pushed a second time, clearly struggling in my situation. Nothing. Instead I felt like he was even coming closer, pushing my purse away with his elbow to make space for his arm. I tried to make eye contact with him so that I could tell him to leave me some space and this is when I saw it. There was more than enough space, between him and the other woman were around 10 cm free space! There was absolutely no reason for him to be this close.But I was still thinking, what if he doesn't notice how close he is to me? Maybe the body contact doesn't feel as intense to me since he isn't pressed against a window like me. I said nothing, I felt sick, weak, I knew that it wasn't right but a small part in me still told me that I was overreacting, that it would be impolite to say something, so I didn't. That was the moment I felt his hand at my upper inner leg. I was mortified, as said I can't endure body contact and there was this stranger inviding my personal space. I couldn't do anything, my mind was just blank for a few minutes. I thought about it, it could be a coincidence that he was this close, it could be a coincidence that his elbow touched my leg, it could be a coincidence that his arm followed, it could be a coincidence that his hand was on my leg when his arm already was there before but there was from the beginning enough space for him to not touch me, I gave him clear signals of discomfort which he ignored and there is NO WAY that in a situation that starts with enough soace to not touch another person his hand landed on my inner leg! At the time I was ready to stand up to him the train arrived, so in the end I did nothing. I felt sick for the rest of the day and all I could think of was, that I let this guy do what he wanted and that I gave him comfort in the fact that no woman will stand up to him. He will do it again and hopefully the next woman won't belive in coincidence.Please if you have to ask yourself if it is coincidence or not - it's most certainly not. It's easy to think that in a hypothetical situation we would react right and stand up to the guy but when it happens my thought will maybe be yours. If you think that you're overreacting and if you are afraid of being impolite...Ask yourself the following questions 1. Did you gave him a signal that you're feeling uncomfortable about the situation wich he ignored? Normal people will notice and will react. Also people who sexually harras others know that what they are doing is potentially illegal. They wont just grab you by the pussy or slap your ass. They will make small movements, a short touch with their hand at your butt in a bus, being too close at a train and touching you slowly... They want you to think that it was a coincidence so ask yourself the following as well2. Ignoring all the little steps in between, is it possible that the situation starting at point A resultet in the new present situation B?And the last thing is, we can't always be all that strong woman that screams at the pervert. We would like to be but if you can't, if your mind still tells you to not be impolite there are other options.Just ask the person to give you some space, if it was a coincidence the other person will be more than happy to respect your wish and care better, if he was harrassing you he most certainly will move away too and let you alone. Why? Because guys harassing womans have small balls and will panic at the sight of confrontation. I should have done this but at the time I thought about this it was already too late for me. Don't let it be too late for you.Thanks for reading, English isn't my first language and I wrote this from my mobile so please excuse any typos, and spelling-/grammar errors. Take care.

I have never been in a relationship.Looking for love has me more and more frustrated every day. I haven't the slightest clue how to meet guys who aren't only interested in sex. I'm not a virgin, but the few times I've had sex have been one-night-stand type scenarios that have left me feeling empty and completely awful. I would love to meet someone who wouldn't mind waiting at least a few weeks to go all the way so we can really get to know each other first and decide that we like each other. That attitude is considered laughable and prude among people of my generation who are mostly very sex-liberated. I have SUCH a hard time meeting guys. I went to half a dozen club meetings at my university and I swear, ALL the guys I met were gay. Literally every guy I've talked to since I've come to this school has been gay. I have no problem with gay people whatsoever but I obviously can't date them so it doesn't help my current problem. Most of my closest friends are gay as well (guys and girls) and they tend to hang with other LGBTQ+ folk, which again is totally fine and great but I can't meet people to date through them. I'm really interested in music and go to a lot of concerts, sometimes by myself, but I have this insanely paranoid fear that if I try to strike up a conversation with a guy at a show he'll immediately think I'm trying to have sex with him.

Tinder is totally useless, I get my fair share of matches but I always stop replying to guys after they ask me out on a date because I'm worried they will expect sex at the end and don't know how to reject that beforehand without making it really weird. Obviously the feminist in me says \"you don't owe guys anything, they have to respect you\" but in practice it's SO hard to disappoint a guy like that so I just don't even bother meeting them in the first place. Also most guys are only on Tinder for sex which is great for them but it means the app is useless for me. Every single relationship I know of in my life--all 3 of my roommates, a good dozen of my friends--started on Tinder, so no one has any advice for me for how to meet guys besides using that stupid fucking app.And then of course there's the age-old adage \"once you stop looking for it, it will find you.\" Yes, I know I need to stop obsessing about it if I want it to actually happen but at the same time I know I won't get anywhere if I don't put myself out there and make an effort to meet people. It's just so hard because my sex drive is so low and most guys my age don't want to bother getting to know a girl before getting in her pants.I feel like there's a lot I'm forgetting to say here but you get the gist.

An event happened three years ago on Halloween that's bothered me ever since. Part of what bothered me about it is that I didn't (and still don't) know how to classify what happened. My best friend and I used to throw a Halloween party together every year. It just involved our close friends and acquaintances, nothing big or crazy. When I was 19, I decided to try out the whole scandalous costume thing, and dressed up as a French maid, with the thigh highs and whatnot. My best friend and I have a largely male friend group, and I got a lot of unwanted attention that night. At the end of the night, and after about 10 straight hours of drinking (not to the point of being wasted, just kept a steady buzz), I was trying to go to sleep on a couch. One of my male acquaintances, who I had always been on good terms with, came and laid down on the couch with me. I really just wanted to sleep, but I told him we could cuddle. He started kissing me, that I was mostly fine with too. I wasn't interested in him at all, but it was whatever. It gets a little fuzzy, but at some point I decided to just give him oral to try to get him off so that he would leave and I could go to sleep. After a while he hadn't come, so I decided to just give up, tell him to go away, and go to bed. I told him this, but he wouldn't leave. I turned away from him so I was just lying facing the inside of the couch to not deal with him anymore. He pulled my pants down and started to trying to put his dick in me. I told him to stop. I told him it was rape. I remember trying to phrase those two sentences in alternate ways, hoping something would get through to him. I don't know why I didn't hit him or do more. He kept calling me baby. He didn't get it in because I stuck my hand between my legs and kind of shielded myself and kept pushing it away. After a little bit of him struggling to force himself inside me and me trying to deflect it, I started crying. He paused and I took the opportunity to jump up and lock myself in the bathroom. He had left by the time I came out. I texted him the next day and told him to stay the hell away from me. He apologized, but it didn't change that it happened. I don't know what to call this shitty event. Was it attempted rape? Sexual assault? Is it nothing at all if your attempted rapist doesn't succeed? Afterwards I kind of wanted to report it to the police, but I didn't know whether attempting to rape someone was a crime like actual rape. I feel like I brought it on myself by letting him kiss me and blowing him. I told a few of my friends. They somehow didn't really care. I got invited to a 4th of July party the next summer, I got there and he was there. I only stayed for a few minutes because I couldn't stand being in the same place as him.

For the last 7 or so years I\u2019ve experienced varying levels of anxiety and depression. I can admit I\u2019m the clingy one in a relationship and I always see that as a good thing to a certain extent. Shows I care, I\u2019m not gonna cheat or go astray. All of my past relationships have resulted in me being cheated on. With my anxiety I always find it hard to trust people in general but add that onto my unlucky past makes it worse in relationships.     My boyfriend is friends with this girl, let\u2019s call her Jen. Jen is going out with another friend of my boyfriend, let\u2019s call him Steve. Before our relationship Steve, Jen, my boyfriend and some others were in a close friendship group. My boyfriend would go over to Jen and Steve\u2019s house when Jen was there alone and they\u2019d hang out. I\u2019m not sure if he would go over when Steve was alone to hang out though. I do know however that Steve was friends with my boyfriend first so he met Jen through him.    A few months ago my boyfriend brought up that he feels like he can\u2019t talk to girls and he feels he can\u2019t go over to Jen and Steve\u2019s house to hang out with Jen. In general I felt a bit weird with him hanging out with his friends gf anyway. I\u2019d feel uncomfortable if one of my female friends would go to hang out with my boyfriend when he was alone. I found out a couple weeks ago that Jen does burlesque dancing and he\u2019s been to her shows before we got together because apparently a few of the group went to see her. In fact the first night he messaged me he was at one of her shows. Anyway after finding out that she is a burlesque dancer it definitely made me feel uncomfortable that he had brought up that he couldn\u2019t go over to their house to see her and hang out. I told him this and that I was just not cool with him hanging out with her at all unless I was there, even if Steve was there. I have very low self esteem and recently I was put on a high dosage of medication for my anxiety and depression so all of this affects how I feel about it too.     I\u2019m really not sure if I\u2019m being controlling or if I have a right to feel the way I feel and ask him not to be around her? As far as I\u2019m aware my boyfriend has no past of cheating and in fact his previous relationship ended because his girlfriend cheated on him.

Ever since Kapersky was 'renovated' by the Kremlin a few years back, there have been reports that it's being used as a spying apparatus for several years now.What I'm about to say is all speculation, but it makes sense if you think about it. You would think that someone working in cyber defense at the NSA, especially someone handling highly classified data (especially of this magnitude) would have been instructed to avoid Kapersky. Apart from that, you would think that a single NSA contractor with incredibly valuable state secrets wouldn't put them on his private computer in the first place. People need to remove their rose-tinted glasses and take look at Edward Snowden's story more closely. He can be called a hero for revealing to the world that the NSA is spying on American citizens, and then fled to Russia and received asylum. But ever since then, he has revealed that not only is the NSA spying on American citizens, he revealed the extent that the NSA is spying on the USA's allies as well, which has damaged relationships and eroded trust. It doesn't take a genius to wonder who benefits from that, and it boggles the mind to think of any reason that Snowden would reveal that in the first place after already doing his supposed 'heroic' act by exposing the NSA spying apparatus.He's continued to reveal state secrets, and ever since then, the USA had the worst security breach in history, which turned out to be the BIGGEST intelligence coup ever for this country, when Russians not only stole designs to just about every top secret weapons program we have (including the blueprints to the F-22 and F-35, railgun, etc.), but they also managed to breach and steal personal data on tens of thousands of top secret spies for the CIA, NSA, and other agencies, not only getting their identities, but the identities of their assets as well. And following that, there has been breach after breach, and Snowden has continued to reveal tidbits of information publicly that have damaged relationships between the USA and some of her closest allies.On top of that, when Snowden fled, he took along millions of top state secrets with him to Moscow. And all we have is his own word that he has not shared these secrets with the Russians. So we have a guy who knows the ins and outs of US cyber defense, carrying millions of secrets with him, who fled to Russia **after getting in contact with Julian Assange**. I think it should be obvious to anyone who has been paying attention to Assange and Wikileaks, especially during the election cycle, that Assange working with the Russians, and using Wikileaks as a weapon against the USA. You know, Wikileaks, who has claimed that they are all about publishing stolen data for humanitarian reasons, while they magically never publish anything damaging to Russia.In the wake of all of this, over the course of just a couple of years, the US cyber defense infrastructure has essentially fallen apart, and government, military, and economical secrets have suddenly become pincushions for geopolitical adversaries.Whether Snowden is willingly sharing secrets or not, there is no way in fucking hell that Russia is not going to find a way to extract information that they need from a guy who is not even a trained agent. He's a contractor with technical expertise and tons of knowledge (as well as aforementioned data he took with him) without training on how prevent spilling secrets.
