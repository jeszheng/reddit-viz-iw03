And I absolutely loved every minute of it.  She was into it too (I wouldn't have done it or enjoyed it if it wasn't consensual). I asked over and over again if it was too hard, and she kept saying no.  We had sex again the next day, although more traditionally. Vacation was over the following day. Never saw or heard from her again.

I was probably 13 when this happened.  I was experienced, having been the lead in a few productions already, but in this particular production of \"Land of the Dragon,\" I had several small roles in various costumes.  Like in Act 1, scene 4, I played a guard.  Act II, scene 1, I played a town crier.  And so on.  I always believed \"there are no small roles, only small actors,\" so I was determined to make the most of it.  But in my young arrogance, I didn't give the roles the same kind of attention to detail, notably practice.  I mean, this part was me walking on, telling a prisoner to shut up and what will happen to him.  One of those, \"Stop singing, you will be executed in the morning, you peasant!\" kind of lines.  A walk on, say your lines, walk off.Except I walked on, and blanked.  I fucking blanked.  I think I had 2-3 long sentences to remember and I blanked.  I had never blanked before.  I had given long monologues and Shakespearian soliloquies, but suddenly, I am on stage, facing the main character in a jail, and blanked.  But instead of all the thespian training I had, acting camp and all, I did not attempt to recover by ad libbing, doing improv, or ever the dreaded call, \"LINE!\" I blanked.  And then I did something worse: I whimpered, and ran offstage.I don't know why I did that.  Maybe I was having a bad day.  Maybe it was my lunch; an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of underdone potato.  Maybe my brain was kidnapped by aliens and replaced with a substandard and temporary replacement.  Whatever it was, for some reason that still haunts me to this day, I forgot everything theatrical I had learned about the incredibly common issues of forgetting a line, and I panicked.  I don't even know what the aftermath was.  Did my director yell at me?  probably, she was a little high-strung, but I don't recall anything specific. And to be honest, this was one of our day performances, which had maybe a smattering of people in the audience.  less than 10, probably. And they knew they were watching community theater, which was barely funded by local grants, and didn't even have a permanent home (we often performed on weekends at high schools, churches, or cafeterias). They were not expecting Broadway quality.  But that cringe and whimper has stayed with me all the way from 1982.Mildly Interesting side note: The most hilarious dual part I played was in \"Up the River,\" where I played Doc Robinson who is murdered by Injun Joe in Act I, and then played the judge who tried and convinced Injun Joe in Act III.  Part of this was because we had so few men or boys who tried out for community theater, so if you were a boy and showed any acting ability, you were almost guaranteed some part.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 205419, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  9 16:49:40 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "I guess disfiguring my hand in woodshop class would be mine.

Great, I thought. What a nice thing for her to do. We had a lovely time, we went elderflower picking and made cordial. We went to a Cider festival (this was in Somerset, England, where cider is so alcoholic you can practically strip paint with it). We had a BBQ with her family.We took her dogs for a walk on the Saturday, it was a beautiful day. Anyone who has walked in the British countryside on a sunny day knows how stunning it can be. Now - 10 years later - I vividly remember sitting on a gate, overlooking the fields, next to her. I remember thinking \u201cthis would be a great time to tell her how I feel and kiss her\u201d.I didn\u2019t. We just sat close to each other and talked. And went home, then back to school.I regret that.

About half of pregnancies are already unplanned, and I think it's about 40% of births are the result of unplanned pregnancies. Ignoring the number of people who wouldn't pass the requirements, having the birth rate cut so fast would be drastic. Spending money on raising a child really gets the economy moving - people buy houses because they want more space, more clothing, food, child entertainment, safety features, health related costs, etc. So if we suddenly almost halved the amount of babies we were able to have the economy would take a hit immediately, and we'd have less in sales tax to play around with in government. I think the long term consequences are too complicated for me to tackle, I'm not sure I fully understand them.Probably the closest, easiest way to implement something similar without the moral or practical implications would be to provide free and accessible birth control to women and invest in research for birth control for men (and have that be free as well). Probably people who self identify as not wanting children or not being good (potential) parents shouldn't have kids. In developed countries birth rates go down anyway. Birth rates remain largest in undeveloped countries where things like \"birth applications\" couldn't probably be enforced or carried out anyway. It's sort of like tackling a problem that slowly fixes itself if your target for birth applications are in developed countries. We are barely replacing the people who die off because people are having fewer kids.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  9 19:05:27 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "What world do I live in that the state controls every aspect of breeding?

I like to think that there's no record of them now, but some guy probably downloaded them even though it barely got 10k views. As for the film, it still exists but it's so obscure that hopefully nobody will recognize me. And no, I don't consider myself a porn star and my girlfriend is not one either.First time might not really count, but I hooked up with her in high school. She then moved to New York to become a model and when I searched her name a few years later, I found some porn. Wanked to it too, kinda feel bad about her dreams but whatever.Second time was when I starred in a fetish film with an unknown porn actress at the time. We hooked up on camera. She's still not really a \"star\" but she has a decent following on her instagram and shit. I still talk to her from time to time.Third time was a one night stand, I had a ton of those.

She did regular modeling as well so we met through mutual interest and we instantly hit it off.She was one of the top 100 most popular stars, not just a random minor name.It went pretty well because she was much less anxious about being intimate and everything relationship wise was smoother, but surprisingly the actual sex was less interesting. With most girls they get very emotional about it and that makes it carry a lot more weight. With this girl there was much less of an intimate bond which made it less rewarding. Skill wise it wasn't very unique. Adult actresses are known for their look and impression, not usually the amazing tricks they can perform. Inexperience and youth are sought after qualities nowadays. So compared to any girl that is experienced it's about the same, which is still great, but not a wild new dimension of existence.Outside of a few exceptions I think adult actresses are just regular people that just happen to be interested in sex and in the visual arts. It's more like dating somone who consistently *plays* a detective on tv as opposed to dating a real detective. You know they're probably interested the law, and probably know a lot more than a layman but don't expect them to have unusual crime solving skills, they just play somone who does on screen.To leave off with one funny story, the reason this girl and I broke up was because she was dead set on quitting college and moving to LA to become a successful producer.

We recently conducted a study investigating community succession after abandonment in abandoned cranberry bogs within the New Jersey Pinelands. Since the 1860's, the cultivation of the native American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, has been a major agricultural practice in the New Jersey pinelands. The pinelands have been well suited for cranberry production due to the sandy, organically rich soil and abundant sources of freshwater. Although cranberry agriculture can represent over a third of wetlands in the pinelands, the industry has been on the decline as it has moved to other regions of the country. As a result, many bogs have been abandoned. The effects of abandonment have not been investigated thoroughly. In this study, we explored the fate of bogs and examined bog succession after abandonment from time zero (an active cranberry bog) to 60 years abandoned in flooded and unflooded communities. A full inventory of plant and invertebrate species were collected from cranberry bogs of different ages from three locations. Community diversity and structure were determined from the inventories and a chronosequence for bog succession was developed. When a cranberry bog was left to dry, conversion from a wet savanna to either a mesic mixed forest or wooded swamp was observed. A cranberry bog that remained flooded transitioned to a lake, spung, or pond. With this information, recommendations can be made onto how the lands should be managed in the future in order to maintain healthy and native communities.Ask us your ecological questions and we'll be on around 1pm Eastern Time (17 UT) to start answering!

So as long as we are speaking about traits of a personality disorder, sociopaths and psychopaths get lumped together and I have read a book on Psychopathy that gave me a whole different appreciation for the very wide range of affects it can have on people.Dr. Kevin Dutton's book The Wisdom of Psychopaths was the book that really opened me up to at least understanding some core concepts behind the diagnosis and history of the disorder. I would say that yes, they can understand what makes them different. At the very least that they are different from other people. Another thing to point out is that while the disorders do breed bad apples, it's still the upbringing that holds the most weight. So the awareness in this scenario would come from childhood parenting. In the book one of the psychiatrists/psychologists that he talked to became aware of his own psychopath diagnosis while looking for others.

But the thing is, sociopathy isn't something that the person was born with. The way they were treated as a child lead up to them being that way. They haven't become numb to the emotions, they've completely rewired their brains. Because that's the thing, the emotions that are supposedly \"not there\" are there in most cases, but in less amounts. A researcher by the name of Kevin Dutton made a [really good point saying that it's like dials on a mixing board](http://www.kevindutton.co.uk/the-psychopath-mixing-desk/). For normal people those switches would be up in the 6 and 10s, but for the sociopath they would be more on the range of 5-1 with absolutely varying degrees. So some would have the dial, the emotion turned up enough to notice that it is there. But going back to empathy, some sociopaths CAN and do have empathy, but in a completely inhibited way. But that doesn't mean that they'll feel sorry for doing anything bad, because for the most part when they behave that way, there's always a reason behind it. Justification. Everything they do has been done by choice, so feeling bad about it is pretty pointless to them as they've really done nothing wrong from their point of view. But when they really think about it, they know the wrong they've done they just didn't pay attention or care enough to adjust their behavior. So to really answer your question, it's really a yes and no. It depends where the person with Sociopathy is at in their lives and how they were brought up and what they've done. Not all sociopaths are criminals or even diagnosed. So there will be varying degrees of cognitive empathy, so their perception of their difference will again vary.  Edit: The way they'll find out that they are different would be through trial and error. Most criminal sociopaths failed at fully adapting to their environment, so the same would be said for the noncriminal sociopaths, except for the ones that can adapt and \"mask\" their behavior to truly fit in. [A la the Mask of Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_of_Sanity)Really commenting any further would be pure speculation, it's really hard to seriously scientifically pin down whether or not most sociopaths can be aware, as most sociopaths that are talked about are the ones that have had the history of crime and the diagnosis to count. And the ones that aren't within these structures are hard to seriously analyze and study. Many research teams have tried, but have been highly faulty and completely inaccurate because the way the disorders are specified and the way the disorder itself can hide and blend in. But that's not to mean that the research isn't pointless, they're more on the lines of detailing the thoughts and traits of psychopathy within the general public, not people who would seriously be considered actual sociopaths/psychopaths.

To begin, sociopathy is not really a thing, per se. The construct you are referencing is almost certainly psychopathy, which has some relationship to antisocial personality disorder. However, many people with antisocial personality disorder do not exhibit traits of psychopathy. For example, if I steal from other people, con others, cheat, and lie, but do so for reasons that are based on my survival (regardless of whether this causes distress or impairment), one could argue that such a person does not exhibit traits of psychopathy.Additionally, it is certainly possible to be high in traits of psychopathy and not meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder. One example of this is sometimes referred to as the successful psychopath (think Wall Street executives, etc.).Antisocial personality disorder is a disorder that is largely behavioral. As such, many people who have been incarcerated may meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder. However, that does not mean that they would be a \"psychopath.\" The vast majority of people who are high in psychopathy do not commit murder. While this is a common stereotype of psychopathy, it is overly shallow. People who are high in traits of psychopathy exhibit superficial charm, manipulativeness, empathy differences, and impulsivity. It gets confusing when we try to disentangle the lines of delineation between psychopathy, machiavellianism, and narcissism, however. For example, some people who are otherwise high in psychopathy, exhibit traits of grandiosity and intense planning/politic playing. As grandiosity is a hallmark of narcissism, and careful premeditated planning is a hallmark of machiavellianism, we will sometimes refer to these three constructs as the dark triad. The dark triad has certainly been the center of much research, and a simple Google Scholar search will yield some interesting results for you. Now on to your question. The short answer is that we don't actually really know yet. One major finding that comes to mind is from Meffert et al.'s (2013) publication in the journal Brain. They found that, when asked, \"psychopathic offenders\" could mediate their internal response to observed pain in others, much like a switch. I have a professional opinion based off of my own experience in this area as a fourth-year Clinical Psychology PhD student. I believe that individuals who exhibit traits of psychopathy develop strategies in response to a harsh childhood environment to protect themselves from experiencing the emotional pain induced by empathy. The funny thing is, we all do this just to a much smaller degree. Take for example my sister who savagely wails on my arm when watching a horror movie, until ultimately saying \"Oh my God, screw this bleep, she's stupid for even going in there. I don't care what happens to her. I hope she dies.\" It is protective to deidentify with the other in pain. However, when one learns that they can circumnavigate the rules of society in a way that others can't, who can blame them, they might think. Life is so much easier this way, and it's not my fault that other people are so stupid as to play by the rules. I could talk about this a lot more but I hope this helped! I would just encourage anyone reading this to know that psychology is very much a science, and many of these questions become answered with all kinds of novel techniques, such as factor analysis and fMRI. Sometimes within the psychology community personality disorders and personality constructs tend to get a bad rap. This is primarily due to the fields origins in Freudian psychodynamic theory, but I just want to say that most personality research today has moved far from that realm.

This speaks to the extreme narcissism of psychopathy, in a sense  they know there is something they are not experiencing but depending upon when they developed psychopathy (some think it's a born trait, others triggered etc.), or antisocial personality disorder as it's diagnosed in children, they don't know what they are missing. Interestingly when psychopaths are shown images of various emotion as they have trouble identifying those which aren't fear if I recall correctly.

To begin, sociopathy is not really a thing, per se. The construct you are referencing is almost certainly psychopathy, which has some relationship to antisocial personality disorder. However, many people with antisocial personality disorder do not exhibit traits of psychopathy. For example, if I steal from other people, con others, cheat, and lie, but do so for reasons that are based on my survival (regardless of whether this causes distress or impairment), one could argue that such a person does not exhibit traits of psychopathy.Additionally, it is certainly possible to be high in traits of psychopathy and not meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder. One example of this is sometimes referred to as the successful psychopath (think Wall Street executives, etc.).Antisocial personality disorder is a disorder that is largely behavioral. As such, many people who have been incarcerated may meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder. However, that does not mean that they would be a \"psychopath.\" The vast majority of people who are high in psychopathy do not commit murder. While this is a common stereotype of psychopathy, it is overly shallow. People who are high in traits of psychopathy exhibit superficial charm, manipulativeness, empathy differences, and impulsivity. It gets confusing when we try to disentangle the lines of delineation between psychopathy, machiavellianism, and narcissism, however. For example, some people who are otherwise high in psychopathy, exhibit traits of grandiosity and intense planning/politic playing. As grandiosity is a hallmark of narcissism, and careful premeditated planning is a hallmark of machiavellianism, we will sometimes refer to these three constructs as the dark triad. The dark triad has certainly been the center of much research, and a simple Google Scholar search will yield some interesting results for you. Now on to your question. The short answer is that we don't actually really know yet. One major finding that comes to mind is from Meffert et al.'s (2013) publication in the journal Brain. They found that, when asked, \"psychopathic offenders\" could mediate their internal response to observed pain in others, much like a switch. I have a professional opinion based off of my own experience in this area as a fourth-year Clinical Psychology PhD student. I believe that individuals who exhibit traits of psychopathy develop strategies in response to a harsh childhood environment to protect themselves from experiencing the emotional pain induced by empathy. The funny thing is, we all do this just to a much smaller degree. Take for example my sister who savagely wails on my arm when watching a horror movie, until ultimately saying \"Oh my God, screw this bleep, she's stupid for even going in there. I don't care what happens to her. I hope she dies.\" It is protective to deidentify with the other in pain. However, when one learns that they can circumnavigate the rules of society in a way that others can't, who can blame them, they might think. Life is so much easier this way, and it's not my fault that other people are so stupid as to play by the rules. I could talk about this a lot more but I hope this helped! I would just encourage anyone reading this to know that psychology is very much a science, and many of these questions become answered with all kinds of novel techniques, such as factor analysis and fMRI. Sometimes within the psychology community personality disorders and personality constructs tend to get a bad rap. This is primarily due to the fields origins in Freudian psychodynamic theory, but I just want to say that most personality research today has moved far from that realm.

But the thing is, sociopathy isn't something that the person was born with. The way they were treated as a child lead up to them being that way. They haven't become numb to the emotions, they've completely rewired their brains. Because that's the thing, the emotions that are supposedly \"not there\" are there in most cases, but in less amounts. A researcher by the name of Kevin Dutton made a [really good point saying that it's like dials on a mixing board](http://www.kevindutton.co.uk/the-psychopath-mixing-desk/). For normal people those switches would be up in the 6 and 10s, but for the sociopath they would be more on the range of 5-1 with absolutely varying degrees. So some would have the dial, the emotion turned up enough to notice that it is there. But going back to empathy, some sociopaths CAN and do have empathy, but in a completely inhibited way. But that doesn't mean that they'll feel sorry for doing anything bad, because for the most part when they behave that way, there's always a reason behind it. Justification. Everything they do has been done by choice, so feeling bad about it is pretty pointless to them as they've really done nothing wrong from their point of view. But when they really think about it, they know the wrong they've done they just didn't pay attention or care enough to adjust their behavior. So to really answer your question, it's really a yes and no. It depends where the person with Sociopathy is at in their lives and how they were brought up and what they've done. Not all sociopaths are criminals or even diagnosed. So there will be varying degrees of cognitive empathy, so their perception of their difference will again vary.  Edit: The way they'll find out that they are different would be through trial and error. Most criminal sociopaths failed at fully adapting to their environment, so the same would be said for the noncriminal sociopaths, except for the ones that can adapt and \"mask\" their behavior to truly fit in. [A la the Mask of Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_of_Sanity)Really commenting any further would be pure speculation, it's really hard to seriously scientifically pin down whether or not most sociopaths can be aware, as most sociopaths that are talked about are the ones that have had the history of crime and the diagnosis to count. And the ones that aren't within these structures are hard to seriously analyze and study. Many research teams have tried, but have been highly faulty and completely inaccurate because the way the disorders are specified and the way the disorder itself can hide and blend in. But that's not to mean that the research isn't pointless, they're more on the lines of detailing the thoughts and traits of psychopathy within the general public, not people who would seriously be considered actual sociopaths/psychopaths.

Shoutout to /u/bbrhuft, /u/urbanek2525, /u/tea_and_biology, /u/genius_retard, and anyone else who I may have forgotten. Thread TL/DR: There are two different paths that a plant can take to photosynthesize: C3 and **C4**. C4 is more efficient at doing this, so the best plants for getting that carbon out of the atmosphere would be something that goes through this pathway. A good common example is a **grass** or **bamboo**.A fast-growing plant like grass (bamboo) or algae will go through this process the fastest, but to keep the carbon locked away, it requires a fair amount of upkeep. You can't just bury the freshly cut plant because it will create methane. You will have to essentially \"burn\" it in an oxygen-free environment, creating charcoal, and then bury it away to keep that carbon out of the atmosphere (Shockingly, I didn't think of this before. Reverse the use of charcoal by... creating charcoal and burying it). The alternative to this would be planting a tree. As long as the tree is not burned, it will keep the carbon stored for a long time, with very little human input. This will do nothing for pollution because they aren't exactly related.

The gravitational potential at an infinitely large distance from the surface of a (solid/hollow) sphere or a point mass is defined to be [zero](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Mechanics/gravpe.html). With this definition, we can also claim that the gravitational potential at the centre of the Earth is also zero. This is because the Earth is no longer *under* a given object with small mass, it is *around* it, and the net force exerted on it at that point is zero.An application of simple harmonic motion can be used to prove this, too. It is given that the gravitational field strength at a point *within* a solid sphere is directly and *linearly* proportional to the distance of that point from the centre of the sphere. If you 'drop' an object from rest a point at a non-zero distance from the centre of the sphere\u2014or, in lay terms, if you drill a hole right through the centre of the earth and emerge at the antipode, and drop something with small mass in, it will, neglecting air resistance, will continue accelerating at a decreasing rate until it achieves maximum velocity as it passes the centre within the inner core, and begin decelerating as it moves 'to the other side'. And vice versa. The object will exhibit SHM, precisely because of the quadratic nature (distance from centre, ***s***, i.e. the independent variable, is squared) of the formula above.

To my knowledge, if the Earth were a point mass, the potential would keep decreasing (relative to the infinite-distance reference point), and would have a value of -infinity at the centre. If the Earth were a uniform ball, then the force inside Earth would vary linearly from 0 at the center. From the surface onwards, the force would vary as 1/r^(2). Since the force is continuous, you can then determine the force (and hence the potential) everywhere.The value of the potential at the center depends on your choice of where to set the zero of potential. Since the force is continuous, the potential is differentiable. You know it is U = -GM/r + A (where A = potential at infinity) for r > R. For r < R, the potential varies as U = ar^(2) + b. For r = R, the potential is differentiable and its derivative there is -GM/R^(2). With all of that information, you should be able to find U(r) uniquely. You should find that the potential at the center is U(0) = -GM/(2R) + A. Note that the answer depends on the potential at infinity, which can be set arbitrarily. The standard choice is A = 0. But you can well choose *A* so that U(0) = 0. Values of the potential don't really matter. Only the gradient of the potential (i.e., the force).However, the Earth is neither uniform nor a ball. If we drop only the assumption of homogeneity but assume Earth is spherically symmetric, then the potential is also spherically symmetric. However, the potential is determined by the radial density via the divergence theorem (div(**g**) ~ \u03f1). If you assume **g** = g(r)**e***_r_*, then you can find g(r) in terms of \u03f1 = \u03f1(r) with one explicit integral.The radial density of Earth has a very sharp increase at the mantle-core boundary, where the density jumps from about 5000 kg/m^(3) to 10,000 kg/m^(3) over a radial distance of only a few kilometers. The density then continues to increase towards the center, with some jumps here and there but nothing as dramatic as the jump at the mantle-core boundary. (The density at the center is about 13,000 kg/m^(3). As such, the interior gravitational field **g** does not scale linearly with *r*. The force is again 0 at the center (as it must be if \u03f1 is bounded), the force increases to a maximum near the mantle-core boundary, then slightly decreases towards the surface, then finally drops off as 1/r^(2) beyond the surface.***Exercise:*** Show that the potential at the center is`[; U(0) = A - k\\int_0^{\\infty}{\\rho(r) r\\,dr} ;]`where again A = potential at infinity and k is some constant to make all the units come out right (it's *G* with some factors of 4pi or whatever it needs to be).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 64308, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  9 21:26:29 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "The wikipedia entry for the Earth's gravity has this [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth#/media/File:EarthGravityPREM.svg) of the acceleration in m/sec squared by both depth into and distance from the earth.

The answer to that question gives you a clear formula.

Wikipedia gives the [exact same formula, a third time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#Spherical_symmetry).TL;DR: Gravitational potential at distance ***s*** from centre in a sphere of radius ***r***, **\u03d5** = \u2013***GM***(3***r***^(2) \u2013 ***s***^(2)) \u00f7 2***r***^(3).> And what would the gravitational potential be at the centre?That would be zero. The gravitational potential at an infinitely large distance from the surface of a (solid/hollow) sphere or a point mass is defined to be [zero](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Mechanics/gravpe.html). With this definition, we can also claim that the gravitational potential at the centre of the Earth is also zero. This is because the Earth is no longer *under* a given object with small mass, it is *around* it, and the net force exerted on it at that point is zero.An application of simple harmonic motion can be used to prove this, too. It is given that the gravitational field strength at a point *within* a solid sphere is directly and *linearly* proportional to the distance of that point from the centre of the sphere. If you 'drop' an object from rest a point at a non-zero distance from the centre of the sphere\u2014or, in lay terms, if you drill a hole right through the centre of the earth and emerge at the antipode, and drop something with small mass in, it will, neglecting air resistance, will continue accelerating at a decreasing rate until it achieves maximum velocity as it passes the centre within the inner core, and begin decelerating as it moves 'to the other side'. And vice versa. The object will exhibit SHM, precisely because of the quadratic nature (distance from centre, ***s***, i.e. the independent variable, is squared) of the formula above.

To my knowledge, if the Earth were a point mass, the potential would keep decreasing (relative to the infinite-distance reference point), and would have a value of -infinity at the centre. If the Earth were a uniform ball, then the force inside Earth would vary linearly from 0 at the center. From the surface onwards, the force would vary as 1/r^(2). Since the force is continuous, you can then determine the force (and hence the potential) everywhere.The value of the potential at the center depends on your choice of where to set the zero of potential. Since the force is continuous, the potential is differentiable. You know it is U = -GM/r + A (where A = potential at infinity) for r > R. For r < R, the potential varies as U = ar^(2) + b. For r = R, the potential is differentiable and its derivative there is -GM/R^(2). With all of that information, you should be able to find U(r) uniquely. You should find that the potential at the center is U(0) = -GM/(2R) + A. Note that the answer depends on the potential at infinity, which can be set arbitrarily. The standard choice is A = 0. But you can well choose *A* so that U(0) = 0. Values of the potential don't really matter. Only the gradient of the potential (i.e., the force).However, the Earth is neither uniform nor a ball. If we drop only the assumption of homogeneity but assume Earth is spherically symmetric, then the potential is also spherically symmetric. However, the potential is determined by the radial density via the divergence theorem (div(**g**) ~ \u03f1). If you assume **g** = g(r)**e***_r_*, then you can find g(r) in terms of \u03f1 = \u03f1(r) with one explicit integral.The radial density of Earth has a very sharp increase at the mantle-core boundary, where the density jumps from about 5000 kg/m^(3) to 10,000 kg/m^(3) over a radial distance of only a few kilometers. The density then continues to increase towards the center, with some jumps here and there but nothing as dramatic as the jump at the mantle-core boundary. (The density at the center is about 13,000 kg/m^(3). As such, the interior gravitational field **g** does not scale linearly with *r*. The force is again 0 at the center (as it must be if \u03f1 is bounded), the force increases to a maximum near the mantle-core boundary, then slightly decreases towards the surface, then finally drops off as 1/r^(2) beyond the surface.***Exercise:*** Show that the potential at the center is`[; U(0) = A - k\\int_0^{\\infty}{\\rho(r) r\\,dr} ;]`where again A = potential at infinity and k is some constant to make all the units come out right (it's *G* with some factors of 4pi or whatever it needs to be).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 64308, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  9 21:26:29 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "The wikipedia entry for the Earth's gravity has this [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth#/media/File:EarthGravityPREM.svg) of the acceleration in m/sec squared by both depth into and distance from the earth.

Mitch is part of the machine that is keeping Trump from cleaning house....    So here's how we turn that on its head: Instead of fighting back against the narrative that Democrats are \"the establishment\" we turn it right back on our opponents.  \"Republicans have had control of Congress (Well, the House, but we don't have to say that explicitly) for eight years (as of 2018) and what have they done with it!?  Fight to keep you down!  The establishment wants to take away your health care, your voting rights, your very liberties, all so they can give their elite cosmopolitan buddies a tax break!\"    Seriously, you can't *get* more establishment than \"Let's just never change anything, in fact, let's go back to 18/1963.\"  Then we start really laying it on...    \"Why does a New York billionaire like Steve Mnuchin need *you* to pay for his vacation to Fort Knox?\"  \"Why does a Washington, DC millionaire like Mitch McConnell need *you* to pay for his health care?\"  \"Why does a Wall Street billionaire like Tom Price need *you* to pay for his private flights?\"    Hitting hard on the liberal buzzwords like elite, cosmopolitan, New York, Wall Street, California, tying them all back to the financial interests that they serve.  (And a word here on words: I give a shit about policies, maybe you do too, but not everybody does.  Some people only ever get the campaign slogans.  \"Make America Great Again\" is an awesome slogan, even if the \"policy\" behind it is bullshit.)    Let's be honest here, we've got the facts on our side in this: A man cannot serve two masters, and Republicans serve the billionaires.  Are *you* a billionaire?  So we lay it on thick and heavy that these people are not your party, they don't give a shit about you, Mitch McConnell drinks champagne out of crystal flutes while talking about how to take away your health care.    This is the easiest way to strip off *some* of the Trump voters.  We'll never win the racists or the sexists or the xenophobes (Okay, we could, we could win those groups, but it would mean changing the Democratic party in some really fundamental and disgusting ways) but maybe we can win the \"anti-establishment\" vote, the ones who just want to watch the world burn.    No one does more to keep the establishment fed, clothed, and wealthy, than the Republican party.

Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.>The President can simply write a letter to Hatch and Ryan and say, \"Nah, I'm fine,\" and then the VP and half of the cabinet has to go through that whole exercise again. In the meantime the political blowback would be incredible. Trump's supporters would almost certainly threaten lay waste to any political ambition that Pence has, and undermine his mandate from within even if the votes go Pence's way.  >Because of the political makeup of Congress, a significant majority of GOPers in both houses of Congress must vote yes on the resolution to remove the President, or it defaults back to President Trump, and his rage will know no bounds. If the vote fails (remember, it must be two-thirds), Trump will return to the Presidency and his rage will know no bounds. If the vote succeeds, the Trumpinistas will destroy the party from within, abandoning every Congressman who voted for the motion to remove the President and pushing in primary season - when people like that vote - to have all of those Senators and Representatives Cantored. The GOP's elected officials know this. They are terrified of Trump's most rabid supporters in the party, which we see from the Washington Post election postponement poll is still at least 50% and maybe as high as 75 or 80%. Trump could leverage his position as the deposed former President (and victim of the Deep State Conspiracy that he has so adeptly milked) to destroy the party and the careers of hundreds of elected officials all at once, and they don't want to take that chance.Section 4 of The Twenty-Fifth Amendment will not be invoked for President Trump, and may never be. The political costs are too high and elected officials today do not distinguish themselves with their patriotism.That remains true today.  Trump maintains a stranglehold over the electorate and if the GOP were to step out of line Trump and his base would very quickly destroy anyone who voted to move forward on either impeachment or the 25th.This is wishful thinking.

Everyone would have lined up behind Bernie and everyone knew that was never going to be the case for Hillary. The dems made their choice and now we are all suffering the consequences.

I was an active kid and would get jealous of boys and men who, after hours of play or work, took off their shirts and sometimes even tied them like sweatbands around their heads. As a teenager, I was never allowed to take off my bra, much less my shirt on scorching hot days and I've always resented that.For the last couple of years, my husband and I have been living in a relatively small but very socially liberal town. Women face no legal repercussions for nude breasts here even though it's extremely rarely seen. I've tried to talk to my husband about the possibility of going shirtless, not often or for attention, but out of comfort on hot 90+ degree days, and partly out of principle for what I was never able to do when I was younger.My husband basically told me that if someone ever saw me doing that, it would reflect badly on him, as people in his profession are very conservative. He also said that if his friends ever saw me, it would embarrass him and that he doesn't want his friends seeing my boobs. The latter part sort of hurts me because it's sad to hear my own husband reinforcing the ideas that kept me from doing a lot of things in my life. I used to get so tired of being told what I should and shouldn't be doing as a \"young lady\". Now I feel like I'm being told what I should and shouldn't do because I'm a woman and I have my husband (and his career and feelings) to think about. I know this is a pretty small ordeal, but for me, it's representative of a lot of things I'll never get to do. As a kid I thought I was going to grow up to be a boxer or a race car driver but I wasn't even allowed to have a model car or go on fishing trips with my uncles who, for years, have been too \"busy\" to teach me carpentry all the while struggling in vain to get the boys in my family interested. I just want to do something to make me feel that much less restricted by my gender but at the same time, I don't want to do anything that could potentially damage my husband's quality of life.

It started with him trying to get my number out of the blue in which he said \"let's grab lunch\" and I said \"yeah our teams can grab lunch together\" then he proceeded to ask for my phone number. I didn't give my number of course.  I didn't think too much of it at the beginning until I started to notice he would wait for me to get to my car a few times in the following weeks. I would leave my office at different times and he would always be in his car with his windows rolled down and I would always walk by it.  Every encounter was a bit awkward because he and I don't even talk on a regular basis and he would just say bye. I would say bye and brush it off like it was nothing. One day I parked in a different section where I was not near his car. As I walked to my car, I noticed a car was idling near me...it was him in a different colored car. He told me he was driving his sister's car. Okay.... I didn't even know what to say. This is when I started to get weirded out. I started parking elsewhere since.One time he had told me that he would treat me to lunch if I had gave him a good recommendation. I had rejected his offer and said I was running errands (probably bad answer). Another time he had self-invite himself to join me for lunch as I walked past him on my way to my car. I told him I wanted to eat by myself and he said  okay, next time.  His actions seemed harmless but I was bothered by them. I didn't tell him straight up I wasn't interested hoping he would get my clues. I was wrong because he couldn't read my clues. The last straw was when he had self-invite himself to join me for lunch again. This time I said \"i want to eat by myself....have a good one\" and continued walking. This time his attitude changed and he started whining saying \"oh come on, do you never eat with anyone.....\" I honestly didn't hear what else he said because I was already uncomfortable he was whining out in the public on the sidewalk by the office. I continued to walk to my car with my back facing him and he followed me while still whining. I've had enough, turned around and told him \"NO MEANS NO!\" He backed off and said \"ok next time.\" WTF? I went to lunch so upset. I've had enough. The next day I saw him and told him that he needed to \"stop asking me to lunch going forward and that I wasn't interested. Do I make myself clear?\" I didn't even let him speak. I hope this time he got my message. Ugh. Update- wow this blew up. I appreciate the feedback. Me telling him was the first time I was setting it straight. If he bugs me again, I will escalate it.

This is the first known case where the newly passed Rape Survivor Child Custody Act in Michigan will be argued, and demonstrates why a rape conviction should not be necessary to suspend or terminate parental rights.  Here is the full press release:SANILAC COUNTY JUDGE GRANTS PARENTING TIME AND JOINT LEGAL CUSTODY TO CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER WHO SHOULD BE SERVING A MINIMUM OF 25 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR RAPING MOTHER OF CHILD CONCEIVED IN RAPEAfter DNA testing established paternity, on Sept. 22, 2017, Judge Gregory S. Ross, 24th Circuit Court Family Division of Sanilac County, MI awarded parenting time and joint legal custody to a convicted sex offender, Christopher Mirasolo, who forcibly raped and threatened to kill the minor child\u2019s mother 9 years ago when she was 12 years of age and Mirasolo was 19 years of age.  The child conceived in rape is now 8 years old. The Judge also restricted the child\u2019s domicile and residence, disclosed the rape victim\u2019s home address to her rapist, and ordered his name on the birth certificate \u2014 all without the mother\u2019s consent or any opportunity to be heard.Just by the age of the rape victim alone, Mirasolo\u2019s actions \u2014 penetration of a minor under the age of 13 \u2014 constitutes 1st degree Criminal Sexual Conduct. MCL 750.520b(1)(a).  The sentence \u201cfor a violation that is committed by an individual 17 years of age or older against an individual less than 13 years of age\u201d should have been a mandatory \u201cimprisonment for life or any term of years, but not less than 25 years.\u201d  MCL 750.520b(2)(b), but the prosecutor\u2019s office and the court granted a plea deal for \u201cattempted\u201d 3rd degree criminal sexual conduct, and he only served 6-1/2 months in county jail, before committing another sexual assault on March 19, 2010, against a victim between the ages of 13 and 15.  He served only 4 years for that second offense.A so-called \u201cConsent Judgment of Filiation\u201d prepared by the family support division of Prosecutor James V. Young\u2019s office, was entered by the Court, without the mother\u2019s consent.  By state law, the prosecutor is to file paternity cases in order to establish child support, but the law states the prosecutor cannot represent either party regarding custody and parenting time.  After being informed by the prosecutor\u2019s office that she had to move from her residence in Florida back to Michigan and that her rapist had been granted parental rights, she sought assistance through Right to Life of Michigan since they had championed a bill to suspend and terminate the parental rights of rapists, along with Attorney Rebecca Kiessling, co-founder of Hope After Rape Conception and President of Save The 1.  The Rape Survivor Child Custody Act was signed by President Obama in June, 2015 giving an incentive to states if they pass the law using the \u201cclear and convincing evidence standard,\u201d without the necessity of a rape conviction.  The Michigan version (MCL 722.25(2)) was signed into law by Gov. Snyder last year. Rebecca Kiessling, herself conceived in rape, is now representing this rape victim mother on a pro bono basis and Right to Life of Michigan has agreed to pay the court costs in her case. Objections and a motion will be filed on behalf of the rape victim mother on Fri. morning, Oct. 6th, with a hearing on Wed. the 25th at 2:30 p.m.. This case is believed to be the first case of its kind in Michigan, and perhaps in the U.S., in which a rape victim will seek protection under the new Rape Survivor Child Custody Act and proves why a rape conviction should not be required.

She had been battling cancer for the majority of my high school years and had been in remission for about a year before she was diagnosed again. It was such a long battle for her, and I gather that this has been a long battle for your Mom as well since detailing it would take too much time, because I feel the exact same way about my own Mom. It's hard to describe all of it.My Mom could've had chemotherapy and extended her life, but she chose not to. It was a painful choice to go a long with but I did, because I knew she was exhausted and that death was inevitable for her. She was given 1-2 years if she chose to do Chemo again, and a few months without it. She passed about a month after her diagnosis. Looking back though, if I was in your position, I would tell her exactly what you are telling us. Let me tell you, you need to stress to her how much you need her and how important she is to you. You need to sit down and pour your heart out to her. Looking back, if I had the opportunity to get my Mom to extend her life, I would have. Once it's over, it's over. No more conversations, no more memories, nothing. I got married in April and she wasn't there. I will graduate college in May and she won't be there. It's just as painful as you think it will be. It sucks. I think if you don't stress to her how much you need her in your life, you will have regrets. If you express your love and need for her to the best of your ability, and she still says no, just do your best to be with her. Talk about your childhood. Write things down. Take video. Preserve her. Once she's gone, she's gone. There's no real 'preparing' for losing your Mom. Unfortunately, the only way to get through grief is by going directly through it.

We have looked up every thing we can on the internet and we are lost without a professional opinion since she\u2019s refusing to even get a biopsy. Her lab results do confirm that it is cirrhosis, and that\u2019s all we know.She will never see me graduate school, get married, or have children. I\u2019m heart broken. I haven\u2019t been pressing the transplant issue on her because it is her life and if she\u2019s choosing to give up I need to respect that. I am hurt and angry that her death can be prevented with a simple procedure. I don\u2019t know how to prepare for losing her. I don\u2019t know how to feel that a part of me will be dying with her. I just needed to get this off my chest.

She had been battling cancer for the majority of my high school years and had been in remission for about a year before she was diagnosed again. It was such a long battle for her, and I gather that this has been a long battle for your Mom as well since detailing it would take too much time, because I feel the exact same way about my own Mom. It's hard to describe all of it.My Mom could've had chemotherapy and extended her life, but she chose not to. It was a painful choice to go a long with but I did, because I knew she was exhausted and that death was inevitable for her. She was given 1-2 years if she chose to do Chemo again, and a few months without it. She passed about a month after her diagnosis. Looking back though, if I was in your position, I would tell her exactly what you are telling us. Let me tell you, you need to stress to her how much you need her and how important she is to you. You need to sit down and pour your heart out to her. Looking back, if I had the opportunity to get my Mom to extend her life, I would have. Once it's over, it's over. No more conversations, no more memories, nothing. I got married in April and she wasn't there. I will graduate college in May and she won't be there. It's just as painful as you think it will be. It sucks. I think if you don't stress to her how much you need her in your life, you will have regrets. If you express your love and need for her to the best of your ability, and she still says no, just do your best to be with her. Talk about your childhood. Write things down. Take video. Preserve her. Once she's gone, she's gone. There's no real 'preparing' for losing your Mom. Unfortunately, the only way to get through grief is by going directly through it. It hurts, but it's the price we pay for love. My heart is with you, I am so very familiar with this pain.

I\u2019m 23 and have been in some terrible relationships before, ones that have taken absolutely everything out of me and have made me feel worthless and unloveable, but my current boyfriend is making things begin to look up. This coming weekend, my boyfriend suggested that I spend the night at his apartment to spend more time together and grow our relationship further, but I\u2019m terrified of a few things. 1.

I have a small bladder, have all my life, which means I can get up a few times a night to use he bathroom (no health problems here, don\u2019t worry) and in previous relationships this has annoyed my boyfriends so much that they\u2019ve become angry at me in the middle of the night and I\u2019m scared that current boyfriend may become mad if I wake him up in the middle of the night from getting up, although it\u2019s not really something I can help.

I need to share some fears that I have based on past experiences. It's really important to me that we talk about anything we do physically before we do it. I need to feel ready for it when it happens, as I've been pressured in the past to do things I didn't want to do. Can you do that?\"If his reaction is anything but \"Yes absolutely of course\" then maybe he's not so great after all. It's my informed opinion that whichever person in the relationship has the MOST sexual trauma... that person gets to have the most sexual control in the relationship. So make sure you are in the driver's seat; that's where you belong. *2. If he can't handle you at your worst, he doesn't deserve you at your best. What percentage of your life do you spend wearing makeup? 50% at most? It's time for him to get to know ALL of you. Don't worry about it. If he cares, he's an ass. How you look is like less than 5% of what makes you attractive to other people. Seriously! Don't forget- super models date each other and break up all the time. If it were all about looks, then pretty people would have lower divorce rates than the rest of us. Which they do not. On one of our very first nights together, I THREW UP on my now husband. He tells the story fondly ;) *3. Those dudes were giant assholes. I get up every night at least once to pee. Sometimes my husband gets up to go eat at 4 in the morning. Our 6 year old wakes us up at all hours. People wake up at night. If they have a problem they can wear earplugs or sleep in a different bed. Seriously, not your problem.

The two state idea was never feasible and honestly outside of a few Western pundits, no one takes it seriously anymore.Everything points to a one state reality with total voting rights for all and a system of government where seats are distributed to certain ethnicities on a percentage base, or an unstable system like Iraq or Myanmar that will ultimately end in ethnic cleansing one way or the other.

It's not even news that amnesty must be accompanied by increased border security; this has been discussed for literally decades and is clearly the wish of most US citizens. The US has ample examples in recent history of previous amnesties activating a flood of new migrants. No country can simultaneously sustain a wealthy welfare state and open borders.And if people want to migrate legally then they can apply openly and be subject to the same criteria that a country like Canada applies including proof that candidates will be a net benefit to their new home, either through current income or prior accomplishment such as higher education. Or if someone is truly a political prisoner or fleeing from torture or oppression directed specifically at them, then they can apply for refugee status. This is only about closing off the flood of unwanted migrants who are a drain on the system. People from lower-income countries will naturally gravitate towards wealthier places, and who can blame them? Even when those places cannot sustain the influx, for many migrants it will still be better than no opportunities at home. But the things that migrants want for their own interests, including larger numbers for increased political power in the new country, should never overrule what the legitimate citizens of that country decide for themselves.In a functioning democracy, immigration policy should be the decision of each country's own citizens, meaning citizens of ALL ethnicities and faiths now legally residing there; that is part of what Self-Determination stands for. For the US, without vastly-increased border security subject to real oversight, likely accompanied by a practical and limited amnesty, there doesn't appear to be any other option without an unlikely constitutional amendment to eleminate anchor births.
