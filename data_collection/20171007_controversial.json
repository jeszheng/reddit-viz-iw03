It's also not like you can see inside someone else's mind and \"test\" it or assess it to check to see if someone has a \"healthy\" brain with a \"healthy\" personality.

You're just asking questions, the other person could lie, etc. It's extremely difficult, even the best psychologists in the world struggle and make wrong assumptions and that's all you can make is assumptions.On top of that just because someone commits a violent act doesn't mean they have a mental illness or disorder.

Another example of a reaction along a continuum is the Wittig reaction where the formal 2+2/retro 2+2 can be diverted or interrupted depending on reactants and conditions varying from a concerted process to a fully stepwise process involving ionic intermediates.  Also, many formal SN2 displacements are not completely stereoinvertive indicating that some of the molecules may be passing through either SN1 type mechanisms, close ion pairs, solvent participation, or other phenomenon (I've seen >99% ee material provide 74% ee in a non-coordinating solvent - clearly neither the SN1 or SN2 mechanisms are satisfactory).  Note when I say solvent participation here, I don't mean \"solvent effects\" which is normally used to refer to changes in the polarity of the medium, but in fact a series of sequential SN2 displacements where polar solvents will often affect an SN2 displacement in the first step, only to then be the leaving group in a subsequent reaction resulting in double inversion.Where these formalisms get really hairy is in the area of non-classical carbocations where the intermediates often defy simple Lewis structure description. Some useful advice I got from my PhD advisor was to assume some degree of concertedness in essentially every reaction mechanism. This doesn't help with exams, but it can provide useful insights in the laboratory.

Anyone that cared about being right could have just gone and looked at the numbers.But here's the thing - these people aren't interested in being right, they're interested in screeching at whatever demographic they hate.When a mass shooter is Muslim, the underbelly of the right crawls up and starts screeching about \"Muslims\" and attempts to use that shooting as a shield for their own bigotry.When a mass shooter is white the underbelly of the left crawls up and starts screeching about \"white males\" (most often to deflect away from other demographics.)The meme that white guys were over-represented in mass shootings when compared to males from other ethnic groups was one with no basis in reality.It came from the same place the  false narrative \"we don't label white people as terrorists\" came from. It came from the same place \"98% of serial killers are white guys\" came from even though that changed in the 90s and black men become the majority of serial killers:http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Serial%20Killer%20Information%20Center/Serial%20Killer%20Statistics.pdfThere's a serious problem with the far left in this country, they are every bit as bad as the far-right.

In this bigger data set, the proportion of white mass shooters drops down to 56 percent, by my count. Judging by those newer numbers, and the most current census estimate that 76.9 percent of Americans are white, the whites-are-overrepresented-among-mass-shooters meme appears even less accurate. Perpetrators that Mother Jones classifies as Asian make up 7.4 percent of the data set, versus an estimated 5.7 percent of the population, while those MoJo identifies as black represent 17.0 percent of the mass shooters in the database versus an estimated 13.3 percent of the population. According to this data set, then, Asians and black Americans are overrepresented among mass shooters by about the same proportion (a bit more than one-fourth) that whites are underrepresented. This means the population rate of mass shootings by whites (at least according to the tiny sample measured in the MoJo database) is 0.021 per 100,000 people, while the corresponding rate of mass shootings by blacks is 1.7 times higher, at 0.037", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 15706, "stickied": false, "score": -1, "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 12:24:26 2017", "ups": -1}, {"body": "OK, message taken.

I keep up after it and try not to let the old accounts control anything but it\u2019s a battle that can\u2019t be fully won.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 3086, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 22:44:59 2017", "ups": 1}], "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/06/dont-share-aol-instant-messenger-aim-login/", "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [], "subreddit": "technology", "selftext": "", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "74sdou", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Parscale tells \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Facebook employees \u2018embedded\u2019 in Trump digital ops", "num_comments": 1, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 54600, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/74sdou/parscale_tells_60_minutes_facebook_employees/", "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 06:40:27 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "http://www.expressnews.com/business/article/Parscale-tells-60-Minutes-Facebook-12259887.php", "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [], "subreddit": "technology", "selftext": "", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "74tl3y", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Google's New 'Pixel Buds' Translate 40 Languages in Real Time", "num_comments": 0, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 0, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 893, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/74tl3y/googles_new_pixel_buds_translate_40_languages_in/", "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 11:37:24 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "http://bigthink.com/philip-perry/google-unleashes-a-treasure-trove-of-tech-goodies-to-compete-with-apple", "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "I wonder how many batteries Tesla has stored up and ready to go for events like and how long it would take to build enough batteries to power a country.

I had a big wave of stress right when it started (new job, auto accident in family), so it may have been a bit early, also. It was pretty light until about 4 days in, which is usually when I'd be winding down and start having more dark red to brown discharge rather than dark pink to red. This blood was pretty deeply colored, like when you get a cut on your arm, so I knew it wasn't blood from anywhere *too* important. I let it go, but when day 7 rolled around....I was still bleeding. Around day 10 is when I really start to feel concerned but I knew that sometimes periods like to be a troll about dates and just continue on a couple days longer than usual from time to time. But, here I am, almost 20 days of bleeding. I have pretty big (quarter to silver dollar, but mangled obviously) 'clots' of goo coming out of me 4-5 times a day and a couple days ago I was going through an overnight pad in 4 hours. This is the first time I've ever had this happen since I started having periods at 13 and I'm 2 months shy of 20. Several people have told me to look into my recent uterine history and write it down, which, I don't need to. I notice if things are weird. My recent period history was 4-5 months without a period, then 2 pretty light periods previous to this. While not having one for months was weird, the light periods were normal and weren't anything to write home about. Cramps were worse than usual, but nothing major.So, a lot of my fellow vagina having friends who know a thing or two about uterine and reproductive disorders asked if I had or have PCOS. Being that I've only ever asked simple uterus questions to a GP, I was never diagnosed with anything. I even only asked about birth control because I knew it could help me not have periods for a while, which was handy during summer when I had trips to go on. In closing: I don't really know what to do at this point. Folks around me that know about PCOS are telling me my symptoms line up with their's, etc (I am overweight, like a couple of them are, so that compunds with it I'm sure). The thing is, I live at home in the middle of nowhere Texas and, I have no insurance. I'm living in a home in poverty, which gets foodstamps and heavy discounts in low-to-no-cost no insurance places because we make less than 35K a year as a home. To make things worse, I don't really know where to find low-to-no-cost women's health care providers in my area, or if they even exist. I know even less about if there's OBG/YNs around me that do charity or reduced cost clinics, because all the clinics I DO know of are heavily christian church run places where even getting birth control is impossibly hard. I've looked around and there's a planned parenthood, but I'm not sure if it has the capabilities to do what would be needed to diagnose PCOS, or if it even does more than the basic pregnancy and contraception help. This is kinda my last resort in looking for help so I can stop bleeding from my vagina sometime soon, because it's annoying and makes my body dysphoria worse than it is without menstruating. I'm tired of wearing crappy pads, the smell of blood constantly on my hands from cleaning myself up, and the general heart break and impending mental breakdown when day 20 rolls around and I'm still bleeding. The city I live nearest to is Tyler, Texas. At this point, I just want to stop feeling like I'm a freak show to my friends who have 3-4 day periods. It was a joke at first, but now I'm tired of being gawked at when I tell them I'm still bleeding and looking for help.

Basically Harrison Fords character goes to kiss this woman android. She turns her face and gets up to leave his apartment. He comes after her and slams the door shut. The camera flashes on his angry face. She backs away and begins to weep. He keeps the angry expression and walks up to her. She goes to say something. \"I cant be sure if....\" If you have ever been in this situation then you know that you are struggling to find a \"good excuse\" for rejecting this man. Something that wont crush his ego and cause him to pound your face in. The standard go-to is \"I have a boyfriend\". Anyway, next he grabs her face with both hands and stiffles her words with a forced kiss which she doesn't return. He then coldly tells her to tell him to kiss her. She does not. He repeats the instruction with more venom. She says the words. Then he tells her to tell him that she wants him. She does so. He then kisses her in the most awkward scene I have ever watched. There is never a kind moment between them or a loving one or even a passionate one. It's just an angry man and a trapped weepy woman. This is the movies hero, ladies and gents.

I was traveling for work with a male coworker and we hit the karaoke bar. Me and the coworker were actually sleeping together at the time in a FWB arrangement and we were psyched that our travel schedules synced up, so it was definitely not him - actually he didn't have a very fun night after it happened. We'd gotten off the plane, dropped our stuff at our hotel, went out for a beer and ended up at a really crowded karaoke place. We each got a beer, drank it slowly enough that the bouncer guys made us buy another one (not sure how it is now, but at the time NOLA bars on Bourbon street had rules that you had to buy a drink or a coke every 30 minutes or you had to leave) We each got a second beer and halfway through it I felt... drunk. Like I had suddenly gone from sober to drunk in the space of a minute or two. My head was swimming and I couldn't keep focus with my eyes and the thought of taking another sip of beer nauseated me. I told coworker guy how I felt and he said we should get fresh air - outside I was just so head swimmy I asked to go back to the hotel. Don't remember getting there. Do remember trying to get a drink of water and the glass falling from my hand in the hotel bathroom, shattering on the floor and then I stepped in it and tracked blood all over the hotel room. Passed out face down on one of the beds. Coworker patched up my foot while I was out and cleared up the broken glass but there was still bloody footprints on the carpet in the morning. God knows what the cleaning staff thought. He stayed up taking my pulse and checking my breathing and temp because he didn't know what else to do. In the morning I felt legitimately hung over, like as bad as if I had been blackout drunk - I had had only had 1 full and perhaps 1/4 of a second light beer total.  The next day during work meetings we started wondering if I'd gotten a drugged drink. At the time it wasn't so well known, so it wasn't the first place our minds went - but there was no other explanation. Also because people didn't talk about it as much then, I had paid no attention to my open drinks in the bar. So who knows. It will always be a mystery to me. Who did it, why did they do it when I was there with a guy, maybe I drank someone else's drink by accident - ???  Anyway coworker went back to that bar the next night and told them what he thought happened. They shrugged it off \"yeah, maybe\" and that was that. I felt like crap the entire next day, like a full 24 hour hangover, then I was fine. It really scared me though.   Whenever someone talks about getting drinks drugged I remember how I felt that night, how it was all I could do to get home WITH a completely supportive, caretaking friend guiding me. I probably just looked really drunk. I would have been a goner if that had happened to me when I was alone, or with someone I didn't know well. I had no way of taking care of myself. I didn't even feel stepping on broken glass. I didn't even wake up when someone removed the glass from my foot and washed it. I definitely wouldn't have felt any more sinister acts. The next day i felt super hung over - if I hadn't have drank such a small amount, I could even see how after  heavy night I would have just thought I'd had too much to drink. So freaking scary.

That is NOT even funny.\" I'm automatically taken aback. I'm so used to the jokes that I never expect another man to intervene. His friend starts to explain how terrible that is. The first guy says \"I didn't know that was actually a thing. People don't actually roofie each other.\" So I explained that I had been drugged and raped before. He legitimately said he had never heard of that happening before. Thankfully, his friend explained that it happens often and is super fucked up.The friend and I explained all about it to the other two friends until they completely understood. I can't believe it's 2017 and there are men who still don't believe that women get drugged at bars. I'm glad that two more got educated tonight and more thankful that their friend stepped up to immediately defend me because he knows how bad things are for women.Educate your friends, male AND female. Threats are real. In the South, we're so trusting. We have to be aware. It is NOT SAFE OUT THERE. Be vigilant. For yourself, for your friends, and for strangers.

I was traveling for work with a male coworker and we hit the karaoke bar. Me and the coworker were actually sleeping together at the time in a FWB arrangement and we were psyched that our travel schedules synced up, so it was definitely not him - actually he didn't have a very fun night after it happened. We'd gotten off the plane, dropped our stuff at our hotel, went out for a beer and ended up at a really crowded karaoke place. We each got a beer, drank it slowly enough that the bouncer guys made us buy another one (not sure how it is now, but at the time NOLA bars on Bourbon street had rules that you had to buy a drink or a coke every 30 minutes or you had to leave) We each got a second beer and halfway through it I felt... drunk. Like I had suddenly gone from sober to drunk in the space of a minute or two. My head was swimming and I couldn't keep focus with my eyes and the thought of taking another sip of beer nauseated me. I told coworker guy how I felt and he said we should get fresh air - outside I was just so head swimmy I asked to go back to the hotel. Don't remember getting there. Do remember trying to get a drink of water and the glass falling from my hand in the hotel bathroom, shattering on the floor and then I stepped in it and tracked blood all over the hotel room. Passed out face down on one of the beds. Coworker patched up my foot while I was out and cleared up the broken glass but there was still bloody footprints on the carpet in the morning. God knows what the cleaning staff thought. He stayed up taking my pulse and checking my breathing and temp because he didn't know what else to do. In the morning I felt legitimately hung over, like as bad as if I had been blackout drunk - I had had only had 1 full and perhaps 1/4 of a second light beer total.  The next day during work meetings we started wondering if I'd gotten a drugged drink. At the time it wasn't so well known, so it wasn't the first place our minds went - but there was no other explanation. Also because people didn't talk about it as much then, I had paid no attention to my open drinks in the bar. So who knows. It will always be a mystery to me. Who did it, why did they do it when I was there with a guy, maybe I drank someone else's drink by accident - ???  Anyway coworker went back to that bar the next night and told them what he thought happened. They shrugged it off \"yeah, maybe\" and that was that. I felt like crap the entire next day, like a full 24 hour hangover, then I was fine. It really scared me though.   Whenever someone talks about getting drinks drugged I remember how I felt that night, how it was all I could do to get home WITH a completely supportive, caretaking friend guiding me. I probably just looked really drunk. I would have been a goner if that had happened to me when I was alone, or with someone I didn't know well. I had no way of taking care of myself. I didn't even feel stepping on broken glass. I didn't even wake up when someone removed the glass from my foot and washed it. I definitely wouldn't have felt any more sinister acts. The next day i felt super hung over - if I hadn't have drank such a small amount, I could even see how after  heavy night I would have just thought I'd had too much to drink. So freaking scary.

I've never heard him make that kind of noise before. It had a ring of, \"I want to tear the hell out of someone, Mom come quick!\" and so I did. What I witnessed was you walking down the sidewalk past my house, eyes averted away from the car that was slowly keeping pace with you. You were not looking at it, you wouldn't look at me, you were just walking as it slowly crept along beside you. Alarm bells went off in my head. I stepped outside of my fence, one hand on the gate with half a thought that if things went south my sweet boy would defend me. Plus yeah, I pack so there was that too. And I stood and watched.The car stopped. I couldn't see who was inside, but I saw you speed up your pace and quickly turn the corner to the main road where cars are and businesses and it's busy on a bright Friday afternoon. The car stayed put, I walked slowly to where I could see the license plate - I couldn't make it out fully, but I noted down all the details of the car to myself, deliberately saying the make and model of the car and what I could see of the plates. And it sat and sat and sat, obviously the person in it was alarmed and waiting to see what I did. After maybe five minutes of my staring the car down, it then turned the corner, speeding up before it merged into traffic. I walked back to my porch then watched from there, seeing the car speed away and you nowhere in sight.I hope it wasn't what it looked like, someone following you and trying to get you into their car while you tried to ignore it and walk on. Or maybe it was nothing at all and just my imagination. Maybe I'm paranoid, but whatever the hell it was it set my dog on edge the entire day. When the FedEx guy showed up later he fuzzed up, hackles raised in a way I've never seen him do. He stood between me and the fence, protective. And yet when we went to the dog park later he was happy to greet total strangers relaxed and playful as always.Whatever that was I hope you're okay. And I wish I'd come out sooner, so I could have called to you and asked you if you needed help.

Doing so helps promote diversity and has a positive outward image. But there are just few women applying.So you look at colleges. Tech schools have very low proportions of women. But the schools are trying to recruit them. There are scholarships and outreach programs all over to get more women in STEM majors. But there are just few women applying.So you trace it back to high school. Look at at the data for enrollment in advanced physics and programming classes and you'll see a similar lack of women. There are efforts here too to encourage young women to take those classes. But there are just few women enrolling.So my best explanation is that girls are steered toward other career paths even earlier on. Maybe part of it is biological. Girls and boys definitely have differences in brain chemistry. But I suspect much more of it is social. So while boys are taught they should like sports and videogames, girls are taught to love horses and cooking. (Obviously that's a huge exaggeration, so it's only an example).

Doing so helps promote diversity and has a positive outward image. But there are just few women applying.So you look at colleges. Tech schools have very low proportions of women. But the schools are trying to recruit them. There are scholarships and outreach programs all over to get more women in STEM majors. But there are just few women applying.So you trace it back to high school. Look at at the data for enrollment in advanced physics and programming classes and you'll see a similar lack of women. There are efforts here too to encourage young women to take those classes. But there are just few women enrolling.So my best explanation is that girls are steered toward other career paths even earlier on. Maybe part of it is biological. Girls and boys definitely have differences in brain chemistry. But I suspect much more of it is social. So while boys are taught they should like sports and videogames, girls are taught to love horses and cooking. (Obviously that's a huge exaggeration, so it's only an example).

She said to me that when I send her a message saying \"I miss you\" it gives her intense anxiety attacks. I only texted once a day, usually in the morning. And it was always the same \"good morning, I love you and miss you, hope you have a wonderful day\". No response from her at all. We were dating for a year and a half. We spoke about family and marriage and stuff. Even did some promise rings. It was a very serious relationship despite the distance. Ultimately I called it off. I told her from the very start, if anything if wrong, we can talk and you can just walk away. It was me that did the walking away. She was not happy about that at all.

Seemed fairly standard to me at the time. We moved in together several years later, when I worked a job in an industry that is very male-dominated. He didn't like when I hung out with my coworkers. Then he didn't like when I hung out with my gay male friends. And then my female friends. And then my best friend (since we were 15.) ... and then my own mother.

They looked out for me, and the day I told him I was leaving I had 3 offers for places to stay, an offer of a place to store my belongings, offers for rides to work, dinner, etc. It took 4 years after the divorce, and a sign over the hand dryer in a college bathroom for me to give it a name: abuse. The sign was a pie chart with 8 pieces, with examples of different kinds of abuse. He was 6 of 8, and one only didn't apply because we didn't have kids. Did I love him? Sure.

I decide to just leave the room, and so I do, and I stop at a table with some people just outside the room. Sure enough, 30 seconds later, guy walks out of the room by himself, stops at the table I stopped at. Doesn't even make conversation with the people there. At this point I'm mentally freaking out. I open the notes in my phone and type, \"please pretend to live where I do, guy is following me\" and show it to the girl next to me like it's a meme or something. She immediately nods and we get out of there.We take the elevator down to the bottom floor. Guy is literally waiting at the bottom of the steps. \"Where are you going?\"\"We're going home,\" says the girl. Gets us moving in a direction opposite of where I live, on a roundabout route to her car, and drives me home. Along the way, tells me about using keys as weapons, and that I did the right thing. Honestly??? One of the most badass people ever. I don't think I can thank her enough. tl:dr: creepy guy follows me, but calm and collected girl helps me get home and I am eternally grateful ", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "74tqpi", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "I'm creeped out at this following guy, but got help from amazing lady (story, just happened)", "num_comments": 38, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 146, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 331, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/74tqpi/im_creeped_out_at_this_following_guy_but_got_help/", "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 12:26:40 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Real women help their sisters.

I hate to call him that. I love him but I've had a few family members and friends point out a few red flags and now it's seemingly obvious when it wasn't last month. A part of me just wants to think that they're just making things up, making things a bigger deal or misinterpreting it but I'm not so sure now. Maybe I'm the emotional abuser? And he's right and I'm wrong?I like walking away during fights and he's called me out and I've worked on it. I cry when I get worked up or angry and hate people seeing that when I try and defend myself so I walk away and bring the fight up later. Is that really mean of me?I moved in with him 3 months into our relationship. Looking back I can say I felt that I either move in with him or we stop seeing each other so I moved in with him after living with my parents. I had a lot of money saved up and offered to pay for groceries to pay my way while living with him. It's a big house and he'd be paying all the utilities and the mortgage (He comes from a wealthy family and could afford the house). Now that money is gone and I'm struggling to pay for groceries and he thinks it's unfair that he pays for everything else and I can't afford to get food. I'm not pulling my weight. I'm a full time student and work part time. He doesn't work. He graduated a few months back and stays home. After I'm done with school and work he wants me to do laundry, or asks what's for dinner, or asks me to mop, or dust or do the dishes, things he could have done while I was away. But I said I would when I moved in. To pull my weight. Because he pays for everything else, he's done his part. We have two dogs that I adore. I love giving them all my affection and enjoy the chore of feeding them. I noticed one looked too skinny so decided to up his amount of food one day without saying anything. I few weeks pass and he notices the dog has gained some weight and questions me about it so I explain what I did. He becomes angry that I didn't consult him first. Maybe I should have but he doesn't feed them so I thought it was ok. I bought a Christmas tree last year and put it up without saying anything. It was going to be a surprise because Christmas was great and beautiful. He became upset that I didn't put it where he wanted it. It's his house. We live in a big house but it has no decor. So I got a center piece for the coffee table to brighten things up. He hates it and asks me to throw it out. But I got my way when we picked out new sheets because I complained. He agreed on one of the colors I picked out. I just started school and have made some great friends but I don't hang out with them because when I work and go to school full time I don't spend enough time with him. And I feel guilty visiting my parents or texting my sister because it's less time with him. But I should spend time with him. He's my bf of three years and I love him. He's done so much for me. He says I did or said things I've never done like yell at him in front of his friends or called him a liar. But he was drunk and probably didn't know what was real. I'm sorry this is long but I've had this incredible need to put these things out in the open. I can't seem to get myself to bring it up any other way. I try to put in his point of view and his arguments because I don't want him to be anything other than what I've seen him to be these last 3 years and I still sometimes think I'm in the wrong. I also don't want to leave because of the aforementioned dogs. They were both adopted by him. One from before we met and the other as a gift to \"us\" last year.
