I think the issue OP is obviously dealing with is a fairly common one in relationships. I think the root of this issue has a lot to do with a fundamental misunderstanding between the sexes on how each others brains work. I think we can all agree that in general, with obvious exceptions, guys tend to be more visual creatures. It's one of the reasons why female strip clubs are way more common than male strip clubs. I think it's also safe to say, again in general with plenty of exceptions, women tend to be aroused from more emotional or cerebral stimuli hence why steamy romance novels arent often written for men. I think what tends to happen when this situation arrises is that a girl looks at a guy watching porn and assumes his arousal indicates some type of emotional attachment that threatens their relationship. At some level, she sees it as emotional cheating or in OP's words \"disrespectful\". Guys dont see it this way. Sex and emotions tend to be more easily decoupled for them. They arent thinking about marrying the girl they are jacking off to, it is purely a physical release. Obviously there are limits here. I think most would agree that jacking off to pictures of an ex or interacting with webcam models starts to get into sticky (pun intended) territory.

Believe what you're being told, and don't downplay or excuse. And don't blame women if they feel unsafe to report it. 2. Call out the behaviour of other men, even when there aren't women around. Jokes about spousal abuse, rape, guys bragging about getting a girl drunk so they can have sex with her, objectifying women as they pass by, insulting women's appearance, or juding them only as sex objects. Call it out every time it happens. 3. TAKE NO GRACIOUSLY. If a girl isn't interested, just respond with \"that's cool, have a great day.\" That's all. Don't ask why, don't harass with questions, don't protest that you're a great guy, just move on. No one owes you a date, OR an explanation.4. Call out creepy stalker behaviour. Pursuing a woman who's not interested until she relents is the act of a psycho. Call it out in friends and colleagues, and call it out in movies and TV. 5. Watch how often women are interrupted/downplayed/not taken seriously in business, and take action when you see it. If dude starts talking over a female colleague, gently say \"I don't think (colleague) was finished, and I'd like to hear what she has to say\".6.

Doctor, Professor, etc., so ensure you're using them equally, and paying attention to the person's credentials when evaluating their knowledge, and not their gender. 7. Don't use belittling terms. \"Girl\", for starters. Unless you're calling male colleagues \"Boys\", then call women women. Also don't use cutesy names like \"Sweetheart\" or \"babe\" for anyone that isn't a romantic partner. 8. If you have sons, teach them about the problems, and how not to be part of it. Show them how screwed up the Hollywood love ideal is, and how it perpetuates entitled stalkers. Tell them that they are not entitled to love, or sex, and that no one owes them access to their body. That women are human beings and deserve the basic dignity and respect you'd give to any other person whether or not they want to fuck you.

When a woman tells you about being violated, don't question her, listen to her, take her experience and turn it into a lesson for yourself and others. 4. When speaking about sexual harassment, don't put it into the context of how many women were assaulted, instead talk about how many men have been assaulting. 5. Recognize that while you may never commit these sorts of things against women, you probably know someone who has, and it's unfair to assume it's the woman's responsibility to speak up about it. 6. Know that the majority of women don't see men as the enemy, in fact, there are cases where our only hope is that another man will stand up against these offenses. But many of us do fear men, and that is fair, considering. 7. See women as humans. If a woman says she only wants to be friends, don't see is as an affront to you as a man. We do just want to be friends, it's nothing about trying to avoid some other form of relationship. 8. If you have children, foster confidence in your daughters and compassion in your sons. In the end it all comes down to how someone was taught to act. If a boy feels comfortable with their emotions they are less likely to take their feelings out sexually, and if a girl feels confident in her capability she will feel more strengthened to speak out against injustice.

I would like to see what effects it has on the two main bodies of the system as well as any surrounding bodies, including the primary. For anyone who does not know anything about horseshoe orbits, I will include some links to resources at the bottom.I will try my best to add any relevant new questions to this first post as time goes on (including those found later in the thread). To keep things organized for future readers, if you have an answer or would like to discuss one of the specific topics, I'd appreciate starting any replies to my points with a prefaced set of number ex:(1.Words, words, words, etc.4.Words, words, words, etc.)Alright, so here are some questions and points to get started.1. Do horseshoe orbits have a semi-stable relationship? A.K.A. Will they stay in a similar orbital path for around 50+ million years, and if not, how will their orbits likely change?2. Would it ever even be possible, however far fetched, to have a third or fourth body added to the horseshoe relationship?3. Can the orbiting bodies have nearly any mass (as long as they are similar enough) and their primary is massive enough?4. I'd most appreciate the answer to this one. Can you have a stable horseshoe orbit that is also eccentric (say .2-.4)? I want to know, because I'm trying to find a way around having tidally locked moons, which can be avoided in one way by having an eccentric orbit that can give higher spin orbit resonances than the 1:1 that tidal locked bodies have.5. How similar do the orbiting bodies have to be in size and mass?6. How much less massive do the orbiting bodies have to be than their primary?7. Could a moon orbiting one of two horseshoe orbiting gas giants swap which planet it is orbiting via going in a figure 8 sort of orbit temporarily, or going around the outside the other one to start its orbit that way when the gas giants get close? Also, if this is possible, is there any way at all it is viably stable to do this nearly every time the two get close?8. Do any types of horseshoe orbit have significant effects on nearby bodies like rings and other satellites? 9. Can a rocheworld be one of the bodies in a horseshoe orbit, and would it be naturally tidal locked unless otherwise acted upon?Here are some resources for those who may be unfamiliar.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_orbit (the Wikipedia page explaining real world horseshoe orbits)https://youtu.be/Evq7n2cCTlg (at around 8:45 he starts explaining some things about horseshoe orbits)https://youtu.be/gsHBE3DWCP4 (an extra animated video for those having trouble visualizing how it would work)", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "779mel", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "What are the defining characteristics and mechanics pertaining to horseshoe orbits?", "num_comments": 1, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 9, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/779mel/what_are_the_defining_characteristics_and/", "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 00:58:44 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/779mel/what_are_the_defining_characteristics_and/", "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "This question has attracted a lot of speculation, anecdotes about personal medical problems, and lay explanations which have been removed.

Clunky but its to be expected this early on. I liked the mechs (all 3 looked awesome), the crew and how the battle went on (safety in mind of course ); I'm okay with it not being as intense, I don't  mind the reset or things not working perfectly or ineffective weapons or being slow, getting  stuck, etc. But I absolutely hated the show itself though. Fucking awful camera work, shaky shit for no reason even  when battle was over, the editing, unnecessary  cuts, the presentation, the table commentary (direct pre/post interviews were fine). It made it look all so staged and fake, sorry, \"scripted\" \ud83d\ude44, with the same kind of horseshit production quality  every TV network reality series does now. At this point you can't  tell what's  the truth in what really happened  in sequence , from start to finish in each battle , and that's  awful since it takes all the fun, suspense and \"magic\" away.  That's a shame because  you can absolutely  see the passion and dedication  on both teams and the amount  of time it took to get to that point. The show cheapened  their  effort.  I can't describe it exactly  but I hated it. Id like to see a more \"raw\" footage style of it.

Clunky but its to be expected this early on. I liked the mechs (all 3 looked awesome), the crew and how the battle went on (safety in mind of course ); I'm okay with it not being as intense, I don't  mind the reset or things not working perfectly or ineffective weapons or being slow, getting  stuck, etc. But I absolutely hated the show itself though. Fucking awful camera work, shaky shit for no reason even  when battle was over, the editing, unnecessary  cuts, the presentation, the table commentary (direct pre/post interviews were fine). It made it look all so staged and fake, sorry, \"scripted\" \ud83d\ude44, with the same kind of horseshit production quality  every TV network reality series does now. At this point you can't  tell what's  the truth in what really happened  in sequence , from start to finish in each battle , and that's  awful since it takes all the fun, suspense and \"magic\" away.  That's a shame because  you can absolutely  see the passion and dedication  on both teams and the amount  of time it took to get to that point. The show cheapened  their  effort.  I can't describe it exactly  but I hated it. Id like to see a more \"raw\" footage style of it. If the same production company handles the next one, I won't  bother to watch even as a big mech scifi fan. If it's  going to be done, cut the BS and do it right! Plus, wtf, it was on Twitch of all places. It didn't  need to be so awfully  edited and quick. Could've  easily  just let it play out in real time or close enough. That's  a huge advantage  of a platform  like that.

They should cast parts based on the ability to play the part, both in acting ability and in believability for the part (you can't cast someone in their 40s to play a teenager, for example).  Other legitimate factors are availability \u2013 the actor cannot have another time commitment for another project during the filming schedule.  These are all legitimate casting concerns.  What should NOT be a casting concern is willingness to engage in sex with the producer, the director, the casting specialist, etc.  For years, I've preferred independent and foreign films because they often offer better quality films than Hollywood ones.  However, the casting couch in Hollywood has long been another concern.  The casting couch also negatively affects the quality of films because then they may not cast based on who is actually best for the part.  This is why I'm frankly not at all surprised at the scandal involving Harvey Weinstein.  He's a symptom of the problem, not the cause.  Fundamental change in Hollywood is needed, not just the ousting of Weinstein.  Without fundamental change toward a system based on acting merit, the casting couch will continue, which will negatively affect the careers of actors and the quality of films.  Is there something you the film consumer can do about this?  Yes, there is.  You can support independent and foreign films.  There are high quality films out there that get overlooked.  I started watching French films to help me learn to speak French.  To my delight, I found that France creates some very high quality films.  I don't mind reading subtitles.  And with my French improving, sometimes I don't have to.  Of course, if it turns out that France also has a casting couch, I'll be very disappointed.  I hope not.

I've seen a lot of writing that goes beyond \"sharing a story\" and gives lots of insight into victim blaming, supporting victims of assault, how to help women (or anyone else!) who you see being harassed, and how to curb problematic behavior or thoughts you might have and understand others perspectives. I also have seem some great articles that the campaign has spurred with facts, stats, and further information about harassment and assault in the US and how society can work to prevent violence, get bad people out of positions of power, and in general be a better support system for survivors.My friend on the other hand hates this campaign. She believes it is ridiculous and that men shouldn't need to see stories and hashtags on their feed to understand the problem the country has with harassment and assault. She also thinks the campaign is not inclusive: while it is now being posted and used by men and members of the LGBT community, it was originally intended for women writing about harassment they experienced at the hands of men. At the end of the day, she thinks having women recount their stories does more harm than good and won't change the opinions of anyone.I don't necessarily think that either of us is right or wrong, or that there is an definitive answer of whether this campaign \"works.\" I really just would love to hear what your thoughts are and if you think the campaign is positive, negative, helpful, or harmful.

While that world could be full of amazing opportunities, its history is marred by an track record of systematic, widespread inequality directed at women:&nbsp;Women still make far less than their male counterparts. Female incarceration rates have skyrocketed. Our foster care system is in need of a major overhaul and is, all too often, used as a pipeline to sex trafficking for women and young girls. From Cosby to Weinstein, one look at the news today will show you how prevalent sexual assault is in our society. Police departments nationwide are woefully undertrained to handle domestic violence situations and the courts often don\u2019t enforce standards fairly in urban and rural areas. And of course, reproductive healthcare is under constant attack. Far from fading away into the history books, the war on women seems to be kicking into high gear.&nbsp;Women\u2019s rights are used as tokens daily, but their rights are not bargaining chips. Women must be represented as a whole, not through the lens of single issues.&nbsp;They shouldn\u2019t have to fight for access to birth control while corporations systematically employ wage discrimination policies aimed to increase corporate profits.&nbsp;For my daughters, and all our daughters, there is hope on the horizon. We must fight for the future they will inherit.&nbsp;The Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified - meaning women have no guarantee of equal protection under the Constitution. But it\u2019s close. Only two states remain for its passage. What\u2019s more: there\u2019s precedent for a long, but successful, ratification. The 27th Amendment took more than 200 years to pass!&nbsp;The ERA will not solve all our problems, but it would be a giant boost of momentum to help guarantee a world where our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters and friends are treated with equal respect, dignity and opportunity under the law. In Congress, I will fight to ensure its passage.&nbsp;Look for documentary screenings, town halls, blog submissions and videos and join us as we further the fight for women's rights.

As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was \"sweetheart\". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. Second semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the \"boss\" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an \"us\" against \"them\" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: \"if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else\". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the \"jokes\" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that \"some doctors\" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had \"friends\" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. One day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, \"so Coach is like...a creep, right?\" The response was essentially \"yeah, you didn't know?\" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of \"Girls ask Guys\". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say \"pass\". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.

I'm Cora. I'm an artist and writer currently working on a zine about sexual harassment in the workplace, and am seeking relevant personal stories to share in the zine. I want to hear your answers to this question: \"How has workplace sexual harassment affected you?\" HOW TO SHARE YOUR STORYI know this is a sensitive and painful subject, and I appreciate so much that you are willing to talk about it. Let me know how I can best respect your needs in this. I'm happy to answer any questions you have. The format is quite open-ended\u2014write a few sentences or several paragraphs, and include whatever level of detail you're comfortable with. All stories included in the zine will be shared on a strictly anonymous basis, no names of any kind will be attached. Feel free to either answer the question in comments, or send me a private message if that's more comfortable. I reserve the right to leave out any stories that don't seem appropriate for the work, although I don't imagine I'll want to. Anyone who contributes to the zine and would like a free copy will get one (I'll contact you when it's complete to ask for a mailing address).MORE INFO ABOUT THE PROJECTBecause of a harassment complaint and subsequent backlash from my previous employer earlier this year, I ended up doing a lot of research around sexual harassment. I also had a lot of friends reach out to me with stories of their own harassment. I was horrified to realize that the problem is much more rampant than I'd known, particularly in the restaurant industry. I learned a lot about how to navigate these situations in the future, but was very concerned by how difficult it was for me to find that information\u2014I want to make it more accessible to more people. I want to create a guide on sexual harassment that is engaging and personal and realistic, one that's super cheap to produce and distribute, one that is quick and easy to read (instead of a daunting wall of legal jargon). The zine will be about how to navigate harassment situations, but I'd also like a large portion of it to be personal stories from people like you, that shed light on the magnitude of the problem and its many faces. I've been struggling to find the time and energy for this project for months. The recent #MeToo posts from my friends have rekindled my creative fury and reminded me of why this is so important.Please note that there is no length, or level of severity, or any other qualification that your story needs to meet in order to be valuable for this. If it didn't happen to you but is something you witnessed or helped someone else through, even if you don't know whether it legally counts as sexual harassment\u2014if it feels relevant and you feel compelled to share, then I would love to hear from you.Thanks so much for reading this and for your help with this project!-Cora", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "77537m", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "OPEN CALL FOR STORIES: \"How has workplace sexual harassment affected you?\"", "num_comments": 0, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 3, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/77537m/open_call_for_stories_how_has_workplace_sexual/", "submission_time": "Wed Oct 18 11:40:54 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/77537m/open_call_for_stories_how_has_workplace_sexual/", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [], "subreddit": "Feminism", "selftext": "", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "779arq", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "#NotACompliment: Sign this petition to encourage England & Wales police to include misogyny as a hate crime.", "num_comments": 0, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 5, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 72349, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/779arq/notacompliment_sign_this_petition_to_encourage/", "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 00:13:07 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "https://www.change.org/p/police-notacompliment-include-misogyny-as-a-hate-crime/nftexp/ex14/control/155732890?recruiter=155732890&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=autopublish&utm_term=162977&utm_content=ex14%3Acontrol", "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "I have always loved the original comment - and have even used it in my course work when I talk about the differences of the male view of women in literature versus women.

Anyway, about four months into our dating, there were a handful of incidents -- 2 or 3 -- where he slipped his penis inside me without a condom on. At that point in our relationship, we were no longer asking for verbal consent before beginning sexual activity of any kind, but he had always put a condom on before entering me vaginally. When these few instances happened, I didn't discourage him or encourage him either way. I was slightly uncomfortable with it because I am not on birth control, but I suspected (correctly) he just wanted to do it for a moment and then put a condom on. Once after finishing sex that started like this, I mentioned how I did not really like that we had \"started doing that\", as I was paranoid about getting pregnant. I also said, \"I feel like, technically, this was assault.\" After I said that, he felt absolutely horrible. He cried for a while and it eventually turned into a panic attack. We struggled for a little while sexually because he felt so guilty about it, but things soon resumed to normal. We talked about it more over the next couple of months, but honestly, I think he was more affected by it than me. Flash forward to now, six months later, and I am seeing all of these \"#metoo\" posts. I hadn't thought about these incidents much at all until now, and now I feel like I'm supposed to feel bad. I feel like if my more socially progressive friends found out (I've only told one, who is on my side with the issue) they would tell me that I was raped and that I should not be with a rapist.

Is there any course of action I can take if they did?TL;DR 3 months and 3k miles after buying my car from CarMax it needs new brake pads, brake fluid, transmission fluid, and air filters.

A rep comes to your house to demonstrate different toys, lubes, and beauty products for you and your friends. The restrictions on these parties are that you may only attend if you are at least 18 years old and identify as female. Below is a post a rep made on my event page for a party I have (now tentatively) scheduled:\"Just a reminder that Pure Romance parties are for those who identify as women only! It's not that we hate men! We just want everyone to feel safe.\"When we say \"No men allowed\" at our Pure Romance parties or VIP groups, the reason behind this is to keep all women feeling safe. You may have noticed your time line flooded with \"ME TOO\" this is just a small glimpse at the women around the world who have been sexually assaulted.1 in 6 women, and 1 in 4 children \ud83d\udc94.\"My job is to empower, educate, & entertain women.

Just something I would like to say anonymity, because it has been bothering me.  For the record, I'm a male.When I was in my early 20's, I went to the beach with some friends.  We were all sharing a hotel room, partying, drinking, etc.  I had a pretty strong buzz by the time I fell asleep.  I woke up to find one of my female friends with her hand down my pants and boxers, basically sexually assaulting me.  I was drunk and shocked.  I just pretended to be asleep because we were in a room full of friends and the whole thing could have blown up into a big embarrassing scene.  I really didn't know what to do.  She started sucking on my finger, and I just rolled over and pretended to be asleep.  The next morning was awkward for me.  She was just acting like nothing had happened, so I followed suit.  We never talked about it.  She was not someone that I was attracted to, and the truth is, I felt sort of cheap and embarrassed.I sort of blocked out the memory and am barely in touch with that group of friends anymore...

I think it was also a kneejerk reaction as I've heard \"but that happens to guys too\" as a way to make womens' issues seem like \"it's not really sexism if it happens to guys too\". In that light, while I get why someone would bring up the \"this happens to guys too\" perspective during a time like this and I agree that it does, I feel like it detracts from the issue we're actually talking about.But yeah, that was yesterday. Today, I mentioned it again because of the #metoo hashtag, and I mentioned that the trend of support for these women seemed really cool to me since I've been sexually assaulted before and it was just so comforting to see so many people care. I'd told him about this assault pretty early on into our relationship (we've been dating for two years and when we first started getting sexual, I told him because it was a part of the reason I was having trust issues in that department; he's a wonderful, loving partner and since then my issues have not been a problem, but that was my reason for disclosing it early on) and I think I'd just assumed he would've told me right then if it had happened to him too.Well today, as we talked, I asked him if he'd experienced any harassment before. To be honest, I didn't expect anything major as a response since he's never hinted at it (which I admit is completely my bad, you should never ask that question casually and my assumptions led me to do so) and he said that something very bad had happened in his past. We were talking over the phone so he said he'd go into detail when we see each other this week in person, but basically he'd been too ashamed to tell me before (which I get since I felt extreme shame when I first told him about my experience). I was really shocked and said that I'm so sorry, and I'm sorry I brought it up so casually. He said that's why he said the thing about \"it happens to guys too\".Is there anything I can do here? He said he's going to tell me the rest when we see each other but I feel kind of like an ass for assuming I was the only one with those experiences. Also would like to hear thoughts from commenters if it's wrong for me to respond to \"it happens to guys too\" in the way I did? Would really appreciate outside insight. I feel like sometimes with stuff that people peg as womens' issues, it's hard to ride the line of when \"it happens to guys too\" makes sense to say or if it's deflecting from the actual conversation, or maybe I was just being exclusionist,  I don't even know. Of course now my goal is just to be there for him when he tells me what happened (I'm not even sure if it was harassment or assault, he didn't go into details at all over the phone, said he's never told anyone before :( )Thanks for any thoughts/advice/insight.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "774gzp", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Advice?

Individuals with this personality disorder will typically have no compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure, and frequently manipulate and deceive other people, achieving this through wit and a facade of superficial charm, or through intimidation and violence. They may display arrogance and think lowly and negatively of others, and lack remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude to those they have harmed. Irresponsibility is a core characteristic of this disorder: they can have significant difficulties in maintaining stable employment as well as fulfilling their social and financial obligations, and people with this disorder often lead exploitative, unlawful, or parasitic lifestyles.Those with antisocial personality disorder are often impulsive and reckless, failing to consider or disregarding the consequences of their actions. They may repeatedly disregard and jeopardize their own safety and the safety of others, and place themselves and others in danger. They are often aggressive and hostile and display a disregulated temper, and can lash out violently with provocation or frustration.Serious problems with interpersonal relationships are often seen in those with the disorder. Attachments and emotional bonds are weak, and interpersonal relationships often revolve around the manipulation, exploitation and abuse of others.

Individuals with this personality disorder will typically have no compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure, and frequently manipulate and deceive other people, achieving this through wit and a facade of superficial charm, or through intimidation and violence. They may display arrogance and think lowly and negatively of others, and lack remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude to those they have harmed. Irresponsibility is a core characteristic of this disorder: they can have significant difficulties in maintaining stable employment as well as fulfilling their social and financial obligations, and people with this disorder often lead exploitative, unlawful, or parasitic lifestyles.Those with antisocial personality disorder are often impulsive and reckless, failing to consider or disregarding the consequences of their actions. They may repeatedly disregard and jeopardize their own safety and the safety of others, and place themselves and others in danger. They are often aggressive and hostile and display a disregulated temper, and can lash out violently with provocation or frustration.Serious problems with interpersonal relationships are often seen in those with the disorder. Attachments and emotional bonds are weak, and interpersonal relationships often revolve around the manipulation, exploitation and abuse of others.
