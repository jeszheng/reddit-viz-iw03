[I'm seeing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7aj7b1/former_twitter_employee_says_fake_russian/) here right now on a post I created. I've seen maybe 20 responses like this.  Responders are saying \"only stupid people would believe this, we should educate them\" \"did anyone really believe this stuff?\" or \"as Abraham Lincoln said, don't trust everything you read on the internet.\" It's an attempt to completely redirect from the massive disinfo campaign to make the conversation about if people are stupid and \"we have to educate people\" -- putting the onus on American people instead of Russia and the campaigns who allowed this.     In my opinion it doesn't even matter if people believe the posts (they did... and shared the hell out of them) what matters even more is that Russia undertook a campaign, a full-frontal cyber assault on democracy. Just a remarkble note I read in today's NYT: 150 Million people saw the Russian Facebook ads. And additionally the Russias operatives created 80,000 posts that were shared across the networks.

Apple does this with all of it's products, for instance and they are an American company. Trump wants to bring those manufacturing jobs back to the united states in order to create jobs and therefore he is cutting the business tax rate down to a competitive level, it would still be slightly more expensive than moving away, but thats where the next part comes in. Trump also wants to renegotiate trade agreements with importing countries which would be favorable for the united states, once again, as the world's largest consumer economy, other countries can't really afford to say no. At a certain point, it would become more profitable for a company such as Samsung to move some of their manufacturing plants to the united states where American workers could be making the products and further strengthen the economy from the additional buying power and tax money they would provide, wages would rise as competition for skilled workers would increase and the middle class would start to come back.This is the long term approach and it won't happen right away, but it is far better than what the democrats are doing. Democrats as everyone should know, are all about big government, how do you make government big? You create expensive programs which cost alot of money, where do you get the money? From taxes, where do you get the tax money from? If you are a Democrat, the answer is anywhere that you can. Government whether it be on the right or the left has proven time and time again to be irresponsible with money, many of the programs they implement are terribly inefficient, The ACA is one such example, but it is one of hundreds of inefficient government programs or unnecessary regulations that seemingly exist to drain money from the wallets of tax payers.So lets go back to tax payers. Alot of Liberals seem to believe that the rich are endless money trees that they can go back to again and again and get more and more money for all of the initiatives they are promising to their voters. Unfortunately, the rich find every loophole they can to hide their money or finance it a certain way to avoid getting taxed too much, big corporations are no different, which goes back to why they are setting up shop overseas as opposed to where it would benefit the American people here in the states.Big government programs (and not necessarily those from Democrats alone) have put us in a position to where we have an enormous debt and that debt is going to continue to grow until we won't be able to borrow anymore, if things don't improve, future generations will be saddled with this burden, a burden which was placed on them by the short term promises of politicians simply seeking to get elected.Creating a strong, self sustaining economy is how this country will be turned around, but it isn't going to happen if we don't stay competitive with the rest of the world.

In one case, the AP found that a Manafort-linked company received a $1 million payment in October 2009 from a mysterious firm through the Bank of Cyprus. The $1 million payment left the account the same day \u2014 split in two, roughly $500,000 disbursements to accounts with no obvious owner.Interesting, I wonder if there are any people connected to Trump that we know to have a relationship with the Bank of Cyprus?>Meet Dmitry Rybolovlev, the Russian oligarch believed to have ties to President Trump...You don't say?>He was also the largest shareholder to the Bank of Cyprus \u2014 owning about 10% at one point \u2014 until he lost his holdings and about $600 million when Cyprus\u2019 banking system almost went belly up, according to The New York Times.He was the largest shareholder in said bank?>Rybolovlev in June 2008 bought a Palm Beach, Fla., mansion from Trump for roughly $95 million.What a coincidence!>Reports have surfaced in recent days that Rybolovlev's jet was parked near Trump's in North Carolina a few days before the election. A few days earlier, the two were both in Las Vegas for separate events.Well, I am sure that happening once is not crazy!>According to his flight plans, Rybolovlev started off in the Hamptons in early August. It\u2019s not a surprise to find a wealthy socialite in the Hamptons. According to the geotags on the tweets from Donald Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen, he was also in the Hamptons during that same time. From there, Rybolovlev traveled to Dubrovnik, Croatia at a time when Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner just happened to be vacationing in that same city (source). But it\u2019s Rybolovlev\u2019s next flight that sets off all the bells and whistles.>Days after surfacing in Dubrovnik at the same time as Ivanka and Kushner, the next destination for Dmitry Rybolovlev was Budapest, Hungary. That\u2019s very close to Prague, Czech Republic (85 minutes via air). This was at the same precise timeframe in which former MI6 agent Christopher Steele\u2019s infamous Trump-Russia dossier claims Michael Cohen was meeting with a Russian envoy in Prague to discuss the terms of the blackmail which Russia is holding over Trump (Cohen denies he\u2019s ever been in Prague, and apart from the dossier, there is no proof that any Prague meeting between Trump\u2019s people and Russia took place).Ok, maybe this is getting a touch suspicious.", "gilded": 1, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 400168, "comment_id": "dpatul1", "score": 1, "submission_time": "Fri Nov  3 19:23:39 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": ">The pair of U.S. consultants had at least 15 accounts on the island with Bank of Cyprus and a bank it took over in 2013, Cyprus Popular Bank, one of the people said.Wilbur Ross's bank.

And we know that at various points since that time Trump seems to have been somewhat short of options when it came to finance.So it's a not unreasonable inference that if PM had these connections to dodgy foreign money, DT may well have been doing similar things via sales of real estate. Hence his \"red line\" about Mueller looking into his personal finances.I think the reason DT's freaking out isn't because the investigation's getting closer to a collusion-proving discovery; it's because he has financial stuff to hide, and Mueller's sent him a message he's onto it. And if, as seems likely, it has legal ramifications at state level, he can't pardon his way out of it.My small prediction is, it's not the Russia stuff or the mooted piss tapes that bring Trump down.

I think the hike is still not enough, as the author points out, but there really isn't a point to complaining about refunds.Second, the tax code disadvantages renters, but not because of the mortgage interest deduction (another common misconception). The main way that renters are disadvantaged is that their rent is paid with after tax income but a homeowners \"rent\" is paid with pretax income, because imputed income isn't taxed. It's a bit of a complicated point, so a lot of people miss it, but the basic issue is that if you own a house, and derive a \"rental\" benefit by living there, you don't pay any tax on that benefit. If you rented it out to another person and received cash, you would pay tax. And if you rented that same home instead of buying it, you would pay rent in after tax income.The mortgage interest deduction makes homeownership more accessible, and thus imputed income more accessible, by putting borrowers on equal tax footing with cash purchasers and outright owners.

In exchange, companies would give up the ability to deduct interest paid on loans.>This would fix a major problem in the way the tax works now, where debt-financed investments are barely taxed or go tax-free (because interest can be deducted) but other investments financed by selling shares in the company or from corporate profits are taxed and have to be deducted gradually over time. That creates a huge bias toward debt, a bias that\u2019s very, very good news for banks and other companies that love to get leveraged up and take out massive loans, but bad for anyone who worries about the financial sector taking over the economy, the increased power and profitability of Wall Street, and the risks of letting people bet massively with other people\u2019s money.It's a shame they chose to water it down...>So does the House Republican tax plan do this? Sort of \u2014 in a bad, half-assed way. Expensing is only allowed for five years.

The Americans are causing this division with their negligence and disregard for the Afghan training mission and Afghan sovereignty. Lack of support from the State Department is possibly a consequence in the death of Sgt. Johnson (2), where missions are told to operate without proper equipment, without support, in favour of political value, but at the extreme risk of damaging relationships with local and national sovereign allies. And so we've seen, again, the local population turning against the Americans, putting American lives at risk. This situation exactly mirrors the Yemen raid (3), which seemed almost purposefully put together to create divisiveness and propaganda, resulting in the deaths of American civilians and soldiers, including a child.

Hearing from you helps me better represent Kentucky in the United States Senate.On February 26, 2015, the FCC approved an order that permitted it to regulate Internet service providers like public utilities under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, allowing tighter controls over broadband and mobile providers.  Additionally, the order prevented the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from fully exerting its statutorily established authority over the conduct of Internet service providers who engage in anticompetitive behavior, like limiting or outright blocking access to particular websites or services of a competitor.For me, the FCC\u2019s order brought upon great concern that this action would hinder broadband deployment throughout the nation, especially in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas.  Unfortunately, that is precisely what has happened after its implementation.  Broadband investment across the country has steadily declined, resulting in less consumer choice and stifling innovation.Fortunately, the FCC under its new chairman, Ajit Pai, recognizes the role the FCC should play in removing barriers that suppress advances in this vibrant industry.  The expansion of the Internet has been made possible in large part by a limited regulatory burden.  For this reason, I was pleased to hear that on May 18, 2017, the FCC voted to revisit the 2015 order and is committed to considering the public\u2019s comments in crafting a new rule.Please know, I will continue to support policies that promote an open and accessible Internet for all Americans.  I wholeheartedly believe that this may only be accomplished through a light regulatory touch.  After all, many of the incredible technological achievements we rely on today were created thanks to a lightly regulated Internet.

There are Russian trolls, American trolls, Swedish trolls (I am one), German trolls, Colombian trolls etc etc. People from every country of the world shilled for Trump online, some of us managed to become big on social media. And, believe me, a lot of people from all over the world shilled for Hillary too. The big question is who and why. Who is on respective side? What is each side fighting for?As for the who; It\u2019s not as simple as left - right. That political compass is dead. A few examples; LGBTQ & women\u2019s rights used to be a big thing for the Left, and no one in their right mind thinks importing millions of people from Islamic countries will benefit the LGBTQ or women, but that doesn\u2019t matter, open borders in the West is more important than the LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights. The Left used to be fighting for the blue collar working man\u2019s rights, and importing millions of people from the Third World who will compete about lower income jobs and bring down the wages is not beneficial for the working man. That doesn\u2019t matter; open borders in the West is more important than blue collar workers.The Left used to fight climate change. The number one enemy of the planet is people. When you allow people from a overpopulated area to move to a underpopulated area you suddenly create space for more people in the formerly overpopulated area. This will lead to more people being born which is bad for the climate. But that doesn\u2019t matter, open borders in the West is more important than the climate. The Left used to call religion the \u201copium of the people\u201d, but today Islam is their favorite ideology, even atheism is criticized for being \u201ctoo white\u201d.And the most tell tale sign of the traditional Left being non existent is that they are very pro big international companies. They hold the same values as Pepsi and McDonalds (naturally, big companies love open borders because it lowers wages). So the \u201cLeft\u201d today is basically a movement for open borders in the West. Yes, they will use the griefs and struggles of women, LGBTQ, blue collar workers, climate change etc for political gains, but what they prioritize is obvious when you look closer; open borders in the West.The Right, which traditionally used to be pretty much the political side of the rich man now overwhelmingly gets the blue collar vote and basically every large multinational company despises the Right. The Right, which at least since the 60\u2019s have been traditionally branded as the party of racists, are no longer the ones who talk about race. The Right has also become more global. Today the activists of the Right not only fight for victory in their own countries but they help allies in other countries to make political gains. I think it would be fair to say that the fight is between those who want open borders in the West, and those who don\u2019t.Those who don\u2019t want open borders in the West opposes it because, at least in my humble opinion, they have realized that multiculturalism have always ended up in Balkanization, civil war and the destruction of the weaker cultures. And to import a lot of people from Bronze Age cultures can be very dangerous as we have seen over and over again in New York, Nice, Paris, Cologne, Berlin, Barcelona, Madrid, London, Stockholm, Brussels etc.And those who are in favor of open borders either ignore the danger or feel that it won\u2019t affect them/they think it\u2019s worth it.And that\u2019s that. That\u2019s what our fight is about. And when a big country like the US gets a nationalist leader the people of other countries are more swayed to vote nationalist in their own countries, and vice versa. And that is why we \u201cinterfere\u201d in other countries elections. We do it for political gains and this is a fight we have to win or we will be wiped out so don\u2019t expect us to stop.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 10995, "comment_id": "dpa8i70", "score": -12, "submission_time": "Fri Nov  3 12:47:15 2017", "ups": -12}, {"body": "WE FOUND ONE FAKE RUSSIAN BLOGGER!

I think that maybe I have some relevant information:I worked with the whole Trump family during the Republican National Convention (not a republican, I just go where I'm paid). The Trump kids were by and large not as bad as they're made out to be. A little douchey and self-centered, but that's pretty much expected based on their background. Outside of that, they were polite and friendly and respectful. Ivanka, on the other hand, was far and away the most genuine and friendliest of all of them. Listening to her speak behind closed doors and off the record, I got the feeling that she really does care about the issues that she supports. She might be a spoon-fed rich kid, but to me, that makes her personality all the more surprising. She could easily be a crazy bitch (I grew up in a rich neighborhood, so I know I crazy spoiled rich bitch when I see one). Is she the stereotypical woman to speak about female empowerment? I guess not. But should there be a stereotype? Or certain qualifications like \"I'm poor enough to talk about this\", or \"I struggled enough to talk about this\"? The way I see it, women empowerment should be about many perspectives. And women's rights activists should encourage as many supporters as possible, with diverse voices and perspectives and experiences. Or at least, that seems obvious to me.Conversely, there are tons of rich, spoiled women in Hollywood who are completely disconnected from reality (and, unlike Ivanka, are insane cunts), and they're applauded for their speeches about women's rights and empowerment all the time. They're probably equally as disqualified from talking about women's empowerment. We're finding out today that many actresses in Hollywood probably sucked dick to the top of their career. That doesn't sound all that empowered. And yet, again, constant applause and cheers for women in Hollywood who talk about women's empowerment. Anyway, I don't really give a shit about Ivanka, or Hollywood, or women's empowerment for all that matter. Just thought that I'd share my relevant experience working with both the Trumps and Hollywood stars and calling many of you mean people out for ridiculing this woman for speaking about what is widely viewed as an important subject. You guys are hypocrites.

They asked us to conserve water and when we did, the water authorities raised the rates because they were not making enough money. We introduced Desalination plants here in Southern California to help offset the effects of droughts, but salty water, even desalinated water and that from the Colorado river leave avocados brown. The buildup of salts in the soil then make the trees produce less fruit or smaller fruits; it sucks.  The result is higher costs.2) **Domestic Taxes** - California Governor Jerry \"slowflake\" Brown's tax rampage against California businesses and taxpayers during his reign have resulted in some of the highest taxes in the nation; in some cases coming in [second only to New York](https://taxfoundation.org/2017-state-business-tax-climate-index/).3) **Import Costs** - President Trumps new [Border Tax](http://www.wltx.com/money/holy-guacamole-border-tax-could-hit-mexican-avocados/394234108) will impose a 20% tax on all 400m pounds of Mexican grown and imported Avocados to the USA. Good for us, the growers as we can command a better domestic price, but bad for US consumers overall as the US continues to [import less from foreign nations annually](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_avocados_price_received). 4) **Supply & Demand** - Avocado demand worldwide (looking at the receipts of shipments to the [Zealands](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/15/avocado-thieves-shortage-crime-fruit-black-market-new-zealand) and [Australia](http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-01-20/australian-avocado-prices-hit-record-highs/7099046) where 15% of our family crop went in 2016) have gone up considerably over the last 10 years. With it, so have the prices as growers can only grow so much... Couple that with drought, water restraints and land restraints... yeah. San Diego, CA, USA and its 18,000 acres of avocado trees, followed by Ventura County, CA, USA with it's 17,000 acres have been the top avocado-producing county in the United States (Totaling over 50,000 acres of Avocado orchards in California).

I don't care how many cases go unreported, or how powerful the person is. If that person rapes you, you report them. If they have raped you, you don't let them into your home a second time. There is nothing to be gained.One last point: This actress had already been in 28 movies and 6 television shows before the first incident happened. The 6th television show I am talking about is Boardwalk Empire, where she had completely finished shooting the first season, it had come out, and the season was over before the first rape happened. If someone wants to argue that she needed to keep quiet to continue her career or she would lose her career, she was already very successful by this point. They lived in the same neighborhood of NYC, how much more successful do you need to be, before you report your rapist?Again, I'm not victim blaming, just questioning whether these allegations are true.

Also he does NOT participate in opioids anyway so he doesn't have to be in that system.  THIRD:  My big gripe...steriods can cause massive infections of the lungs when inhaled.  For a 7 year old child, flovent would be appropriate, especially if the asthma is chronic, as in using the inhaler every single month a new one.  However, now days the FIRST thing they do is throw everyone on flovent and singulair even in they get asthma attacks may be once a year.  This is inappropriate.  It is over medicating.  It opens the child up to more infections in the lungs.  My daughter has asthma and was having attacks suddenly twice a year instead of maybe once.  We took her children's and they prescribed a BUNCH of medication.  She had her inhaler albuterol, flovent, singulair, and allegra.  They were talking about serevent also.  I thought this was excessive and told the doctor so, but followed the protocol.Six weeks later, we found out she had PNEUMONIA and instead of treating it like an infection (Which I told the doc she only gets like this with an infection) they wanted to put more asthma meds on her.  We went to a local Physicians assistant, got the pneumonia cared for with antibiotics and suddenly her \"sudden onset worsening asthma\" disappeared.  He told us we were very fortunate that the flovent didn't assist a secondary infection.She no longer takes flovent or singulair.  She does still take Allegra as that is the only thing we have seen that makes a large difference in her life.

It was malicious and would have done nothing to stop further shootings. Once people realized how bad of a bill it was the outcry caused the senate to take notice and stand firm with a much more tolerable act.Ownership of a once legal piece of plastic now constitutes life in prison. Worse than murder, rape, etcNone the less, the truth is it only takes 'one' weapon to commit mass murder. There are millions of rifles and weapons in American homes. In MA alone there's hundreds of thousands of rifles. How can you possibly eliminate every one? Bans are feel good legislation. Non compliance with the SAFE act in NY and CT AWB (assault weapons ban) eas almost universal. Hundreds of thousands of people did not turn in their rifles when they were banned in those states. Everyone of those individuals is an unconvicted criminal. Gun control advocates need to be honest with themselves. Pretending to support the second amendment and dancing around final solutions is not the way to reduce mass shootings. An crisis like this requires changes to our way of life. Demand strict and zealous enforcement by your benevolent lawmakers, not weak feel good legislation. While a single weapon remains in civilian hands the bloodbaths will continue. If it saves one life.A ban is only a start. The truth is once they are banned you need to forcibly take these weapons away from them. You need to suspend the fourth amendment, cordon off neighborhoods, and kick in doors. You need a system of random gun seizure check points and vehicle control points.You'll then need to hit the developing fireaem underground.If you see something say something. Setup anonymous gun tip hotlines. You heard uncle John buried his rifle on his property? You and uncle John don't get along? Well, it'll be easier to sleep at night when you get that $500 cash reward after they drag him off to jail for twenty years. You need to strictly inspect and control anyone with access to milling tools and track individuals with involved skillsets. That means random unwarranted searches. Inspections if you will.Anything else is feel good. You demand action, so that's what you need to demand from your lawmakers. A ban doesn't make something go away.
