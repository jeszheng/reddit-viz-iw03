It started when DYFS placed me in a temporary home for displaced children. I was 17 at the time and lived with 9 other boys and 10 girls all ranging between the ages of 6-17. Things were rowdy and, like another response, everything was heavily scheduled. I still had the freedom to get a snack or watch TV whenever I wanted though. It was mostly meal times and bed times. Every Friday night we had a big group outing like bowling or going out to see a movie. If you were older, you were allowed to walk down the street to the local convenience store by yourself which was nice. Depending on your situation, you were also allowed to be \"signed out\" by a guardian or friend and leave for a few hours. I remember getting South Park banned from being played in the common room because of the younger kids. At a certain point, they decided to move me into their other program for older kids. This time the boys and girls had their own side of a huge townhouse with an RA available all times of the day. They helped us finish school, get a job, open a banking account (we were only allowed to keep 20% of our paychecks, everything had to be put into savings), apply for college if we wanted to go that route, get your driver's license. Basically all of the life skills you would normally learn from a stable family life. We had to cook dinner once a week for everyone on your side. There were different levels that you could attain that allowed you later curfews and benefits which I can't remember. We also had to see a therapist weekly and you would meet with your assigned RA/life coach, just to make sure things were good. You were never ignored and we always had support whenever we needed. Birthdays and Christmas were great and our wish lists were mostly fulfilled depending on what you ask for. You could get grounded of course, which basically meant you lost all freedom and privilege for a week or two. If you drove, no driving. Your curfew was 11PM, you have to be home at 8PM. Of course, there would be the typical drama that would occur from a house full of teenage boys or girls. I think at the time I was the only scene/emo kid living there. Everyone else was big with rap and hip hop so there was a lot of culture shock for me. At the end of the day, we were all brothers due to our unique situations. Unfortunately, I've lost contact with a majority of the other kids I used to live with. I've always been meaning to go back and visit and maybe volunteer but I never get around to it. It was a great place for me and I've had some pretty fond memories during my time there. Feel free to ask questions and i'll hopefully get to them.

We are actually there to promote a safe living environment and encourage the personal growth of our residents. Pretty corny, yes, I am aware. This particular story is about a time when one of my residents was in a very unsafe situation, and I happened to be there to help out.My first year as an RA, I lived on the 12th floor of our dorm, and the dorm housed over 500 freshmen guys. Our university always gives a three or four day weekend between the end of classes and the beginning of finals, and this experience happened during that break right before Spring finals in May (after which most people go home for the summer). A vast majority of the homesick freshmen in my building had also headed home for the long weekend. It was quiet.I spent my entire Saturday locked in a room studying. Literally, 12 hours with barely a lunch break, and I was brain dead when I emerged at about 9 PM. I intended to get some quick food and immediately go to bed, but I ran into some friends who convinced me that I needed to blow off steam after my study marathon, so I went to their apartment and we watched movies and played video games until about 2 AM. I was completely out of it by that point.I stumbled back to my building, brain-dead and sleep deprived. I passed the front desk and said a polite hello to the overnight desk attendant (who I knew well), and headed for the bed. As soon as I had stripped down and cuddled into bed for well-deserved sleep, my phone rang. It was my friend, Gary, calling from the front desk. I, dumbly, answered.\"McCallistersSweetTea! Some girl just cussed me out and ran into the elevators and disappeared... She was yelling and screaming and just seemed messed up! Can you go check it out?\"(Context: guys only dorm, girls only allowed when escorted by a guy. Safety reasons.)\"Gary, I am not on call tonight, it has been a long day...\"\"I know, I know, I just figured you'd still be awake since I just saw you, I didn't want to wake anyone else up.\"\"Fine, what floor did she go to?\"I get out of bed, throw on some sweats and head down to the 10th floor fully expecting this girl's boyfriend to have already let her into his room and leaving me with nothing to find or do. Thanks, Gary.I get to the tenth floor and check the first hallway, no one is there. Just as I expected. I walk over to the second hallway, but a lady is actually there... standing in the hallway. Her arms are hanging down at her sides and her head is hung down and tilted to one side. It was like she was staring at the where the wall and the floor meet just beside her left foot, if that makes sense. Not a natural resting position.I walk up to her and stand about 15 feet away from her right side (she was looking down to the left) and politely say something along the lines of, \"Excuse me, ma'am, but you can't be here without an escort who lives in the building. I'm going to have to ask you to come back downstairs with me, please.\"... no response, she stands completely still with her head still tilted.\"Ma'am, it is now 2:30 in the morning, you can't be here, I am sleepy, and I am just doing my job. Can you please come to the front desk with me?\"... no response or movement.\"Listen, I don't feel like doing any paperwork for this; you won't be in trouble. Just come with me and I will let you use my phone to call your boyfriend and he can come get you. I need you to come with me for your safety, too.\"\"If you don't come with me I have to call the police department to have them escort you out of the building (and then I have to do a lot of paperwork).Just before I dial the last digit to my supervisor, the girl looks at me. By looks at me, I mean she rotated her head towards me. She was staring down the whole time, but rotated her head so she was no longer looking at the ground on her left, but directly at me on her right. While staring at me she said, \"Do you know what happened three days ago?\" Then rotated her head back away from me and towards the wall like I found her.At this point I am thinking, that this is a weird scenario and question... but at least she is talking to me now. Maybe I won't have to wake anyone else up and call the cops for something dumb. So, I respond, \"No, what happened three days ago?\"She rotates her head towards me (otherwise perfectly still) and laughs a loud, boisterous, yet feminine laugh. She then rotated her head away again. Then rotated back to me and said, \"You really don't know?\"politely \"Nope...\"\"Jesus Christ was reborn three days ago,\" she says with a wild, toothy smile on her otherwise lovely face. Then she moves her body for the first time and pointed at a door at the end of the hall and said, \"Jesus Christ was reborn three days ago, and he is in THAT ROOM!!\" Then she returns to her frozen position staring at the floor.Remember, at this point I'm sleep deprived and brain-dead, and on some level I realize that this is really freaky and potentially dangerous, but mostly I just want the situation to end, so I play along.I asked her, \"Does Jesus have a cell phone? Because, you can call him from mine downstairs and I'm sure he will come escort you.\"\"Of COURSE he has a cell phone, but he is not answering my CALLS!!\"Okay, now I'm done, I pick up my phone to call my supervisor to let him know what's going on, and just then she turns to me again. \"Can you help me with something?\"Again, trying to be a nice guy and not wake others up, I take it as a good sign that she is still talking to me. I decide to continue to play along so that hopefully we can resolve this quickly and quietly. I say, \"I would love to help you. How about you help me, then I help you?\" She nodded and froze up for another moment before asking something under her breath... Then she asked again, this time louder. \"I need you to take care of the boobytrap for me.\"\"What?!\"Then she points to something I hadn't previously noticed. Directly blocking her path to the door where Jesus Christ himself supposedly resided was a rope. The rope was tied to doorknobs on either side of the hallway, a classic freshmen prank which prevents the occupants of either room from opening their doors. Apparently this practical joke looked, to her, like a trip wire. One which she was very concerned about and had undoubtedly led her to her trance-like state. I told her that I would take care of the booby trap (a fire hazard anyway, if people can't get out of their rooms) if she came downstairs with me. She remained stock still, until finally she turned towards me, yelled something unintelligible, and charged the \"boobytrap\" still yelling. She actually leaped over it and charged towards \"Jesus's\" room.Now I finally panic... I follow her in hot pursuit resting assured that \"Jesus\" surely had the sense not to open the door to this, now screaming, lady. I pulled out my phone and called my supervisor, Allan, who, in a haze of sleepiness and skepticism about my 30 second summary of the situation, told me to not call the police and wait for him. Sure, Allan.At this point she was banging on \"Jesus's\" door, and I was just praying he wouldn't be dumb enough to open it... surely he wouldn't be dumb enough to open it... surely...Finally, this screaming lady decides to take a break from banging on the door with both hands and tries the doorknob, turning the handle.clickThe door is unlocked. I'm right behind her frozen in panic as she enters the room.Fortunately, all of the bedroom doors in the dorm were locked, but she was quite literally in their general room now banging on the interior doors and yelling just as loudly. I am still frozen watching this happen. Eventually she gives up, turns and sees me, and screams at me before running out of the apartment, by me, and down the stairwell. I turn and follow, and then my night gets even more surreal. Strewn all the way down the 10 flights of stairs are broken pieces of a futon, wet floor warning signs, random debris, and inexplicable spatters of white paint. Literally more broken junk on every flight.(continued in comment)", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1883, "stickied": false, "score": 635, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 19:10:41 2017", "ups": 635}, {"body": "I worked for a taxi company doing quiet night shifts, one time a customer phoned in to say her hire was late and I had to tell her that I didn't have any bookings at her address for then.

Our barracks were old, dating to around the 1950s or 1960s. Every night, a number of recruits were assigned \"fire guard\" duty, which was essentially trying to stay awake for an hour and mopping the floor (or buffing it) until the next soldier came on duty.The fire guard post for my platoon was at one end of a long hallway, directly under a set of speakers suspended from the ceiling. Whenever the drill sergeants made an announcement, you'd hear them through the speakers. This is how they communicated reveille (wake up) and other instructions where they had to talk to the whole building at once. Usually these were communicated in blistering shouts, rendered staticky and nearly unintelligible as they blared through the ancient sound system.One night, about halfway through basic (so sleep deprivation really hitting hard by this point), I was sitting in a chair under the speakers, trying to stay awake. The speakers crackled to life, and I immediately perked up. Unusual for an announcement this time of night, but it wasn't outside the realm of possibility.The voice was soft, barely above a whisper. A woman's voice: \"Private, get everyone outside. Right now.\" The comm line remained open, a low hum hissing through.The voice again: \"Right now, Private. Everyone outside.\"Weird. Not that it was a woman's voice--it was a coed basic training and we had a couple female drills. But for it to come across so softly was very strange. When the brown rounds used the intercom, it was at full, shouting voice.I headed down the length of the hall to where 2nd platoon had a fire guard on duty similarly situated. Asked him if he heard anything, got a negative response.I made a decision: I'd chalk it up to my imagination and tiredness, and not risk having the entire barracks furious at me for disturbing their sleep in error. If it was one of the drill sergeants messing with me, and I got in trouble for not waking everyone up, at least I'd be the only one getting smoked.Nothing happened the rest of the night, and I put it out of my mind until the very end of basic, when we had our three-day field training exercise. We made it through, and the drills started treating us like real humans (almost) again. As we completed the last day of the exercise, which was a near-live fire night march-to-attack scenario, we all gathered around the fire.The drills got to talking, then got to telling stories, then got to telling ghost stories about the base. My drill (Pereda, a male), told the story of the first female drill sergeant on Fort Leonard Wood. Can't remember when it was (70s, 80s), but it was decades ago. Apparently she faced a lot of pressure and harassment, as you can imagine. It was unrelenting and harsh, and apparently she couldn't take it.

First, he promised both the mechanic and I full ride for the trip, food, board - all of it for a whopping 2 days/nights. We loaded up in his truck pulling the trailer with the race car on it. He was going to a racing school to 'update his license'. We got to the track to register and drop off his car for storage at the track - and I found out he was at the school as penance for his suspension for assaulting another driver and telling an official to perform sexual acts on his family members. He bought us all a 'grab bag' of fast food, as cheaply as possible. Next day, we get up, and he rushes us down to raid the continental breakfast bar. At the track goes OK - cool people, cars, and action. Mechanic and I end up buying lunch for ourselves, because he shows no sign of getting anything for us. We get done with the afternoon, more classes for him (we just napped and looked at race cars, bullshitted with other tagalongs). We head back to the hotel, he takes a quick shower (race cars are sweatboxes), and we're supposed to head to dinner. Instead, he rolls up on the worst dive piece of shit strip club ever. He pays our covers. I'm a broke kid, mechanic is just about as broke, they don't serve food anyway. He runs around all night stuffing garters and G strings, and getting lap dances, some of them behind closed doors. Did I mention he's married? Mechanic and I sit a row back from the stage, hands in our pockets, politely declining drink orders and lap dances. We finally roll out of there a couple of hours later. We get back to the hotel, and ahead of us is this drunken wedding party, obviously trashed and wrapping up their day's fun. We see the fruit tray, half of it still untouched (they basically ate off one side facing the couch), that they *just* walked away from. Ice at the bottom of the tray hasn't even grown a melted puddle yet. We *chow down*, starving like hell. Juicy, fresh fruit is filling and hydrating, thankfully.

Each \"core\" is optimized for doing floating point mathematics and the overall system uses a \"[SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD)\" multi-processing architecture where every core executes the same instruction on different data. This is well suited to graphics processing but not to general purpose computing. Though it can also be used for some types of numerical simulations that also make heavy use of floating point calculations on large data structures.GPUs can render graphics better because they are purpose built for the task. A GTX 1080 GPU contains over two thousand shader cores. During a frame render in a video game, for example, those two thousand shader cores rip through the graphics data with a clock rate of 1.6 GHz. A general purpose CPU might have a faster clock rate, maybe even 3.2 GHz, but it won't have 2000 cores, so it will be hopelessly incapable of keeping up with a GPU in terms of graphics specific calculations.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 111434, "stickied": false, "score": 40, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 09:25:23 2017", "ups": 40}, {"body": "This is more a tangent question, but how does power consumption differ between CPU and GPU designs, and how does that affect performance?I know GPUs tend to have a larger cooler than CPUs but I'm also curious about the influence of mobile designs in CPUs vs. GPUs when it comes to the design cycle.

During most of its life, a star is a balance of two major forces - gravity, which acts to pull the stars gas down into a single point, and photon pressure, caused by gamma rays produced in the fusion process, that forces that gas away. Gravity causes the gas to contract on itself, increasing core pressure and thermodynamic temperature and thus the rate of fusion.

The idea Congress can limit a President's discretion in appointing members of his Cabinet or other high officials, acting under his constitutional authority to appoint \"officers of the United States\" with or without Senate confirmation, is far fetched at best. Article II, section 2.2. Congress can't add restrictions to the constitution not contained in the constitution. And even if it is was \"illegal\" breaking the statute isn't a crime. The statute specifically says violations just mean the appointee doesn't get pay. It's not a fine. It's not jail. It's definitely not prison. There's no arrest, detention or impeachment. The law is careful to avoid saying the appointee is unappointed. All that happens is Congress, probably with an eye on the constitutional question, isn't going to pay for the guy. They control the purse strings and the purse isn't opening. That isn't \"illegal,\" that's \"we don't want to pay for this.\" It'd be like saying every time Congress says 'we will pay for X, but we will not pay for the new Abrams tank' that they're making Abram tanks illegal. Even if the law was constitutional, even though it is not, and even if the law made it a crime to have one of these appointees, which it doesn't, Haddon v. Walters, 43 F.3d 1488 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (which followed after the Reagan and Carter memos) decided the issue. That decision said the White House's immediate staff isn't an \"executive agency.\"  Under this nepotism law, only an \"executive agency\" would be covered, like the Department of Homeland Security. The White House is the President, it's not some agency--there's no Department of White House Drivers that needs an appointment voted on by the Senate. Since the President is not an agency to the President, the law doesn't apply. This is why the new DOJ memo is so important. Up until Trump, they were never asked whether the law applies to the White House staff. Reagan, Carter and Obama asked about presidential commissions and agencies. The DOJ isn't backtracking because no one thought to ask the DOJ if a President can hire a family member as a White House receptionist. As it turns out, the President can.Even if the law was constitutional, which it is not, and even if violation was a crime, which it is not, and even if the White House was an agency, which it is not, there is 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105. That law, which was passed more recently than the anti-nepotism statute, says the President can appoint anyone within the White House \"without regard to\" any other law except salary caps. If Congress says the President has the ability \"to appoint and fix the pay of employees in the White House Office without regard to any other provision of law regulating the employment or compensation of persons in the Government service,\" I don't see how a different law would apply because Congress has said the President hires people in the White House \"without regard to any other provision of law.\" Provided that words have meaning, Trump is fine.", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 7662, "stickied": false, "score": 13, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 17:37:55 2017", "ups": 13}, {"body": "Endless pro tillerson posts in here, nothing suspicious about that.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7523, "stickied": false, "score": -9, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 17:05:07 2017", "ups": -9}, {"body": "So...

I'm going to preface this comment with two things. One, I'm not a Trump supporter nor was I ever, so I'm not here just trying to make excuses for him. Two, I've been working in the field of emergency management for seven years. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I would say I'm highly informed on these topics.First of all, Trump did sign an [emergency declaration for PR on September 18] (https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico). This authorized FEMA under the Stafford Act as discussed in the article.Second, even it in the article it states that Puerto Rico had not requested the support described until Tuesday morning. The delay at this point isn't because FEMA or Trump are purposefully stalling, it's because they requested later. While there is some latitude on the part of the Federal government to push resources and support, this sort of aid is based on request. The Governor is in control of the response effort, the Federal government is merely there to support their needs. They don't control it and I've seen this is often a common misconception.Edit re phones and internet: They have redundant power and communications systems, that's a hallmark of any response. While the public in general might not, a command post definitely would and there's no way FEMA wasn't ensuring a way to talk with the Governor day one. How do you think they requested any help until now or submitted a disaster declaration or submitted the most recent request mentioned in the article?

With minimal modifications, a fish tank, pump, and siphon could be added to this.For those not in the know, contrary to hydroponics, which requires regular maintenance and costly chemicals, or aquaculture (raising fish) which requires cleaning the water periodically, the combination of the two, aquaponics, just works. Water from the fish tanks is pumped up to the grow beds  and then eventually drained back to the fiah tank.The fish waste feeds the plants in the growbed, and the plants (and worms, usually) clean the water for the fish. There's a whole subculture of people who do it for fun, AND those who do it for actual food production. A large enough system lets you harvest veggies AND fish which is great. It's particularly popular in places like Australia, with good year round weather for aquaponic farming, but water scarcity issues that make it more attractive than small scale traditional agriculture. Aquaponics keeps WAY more water in the system, as mentioned in the article.If you want more information, I'd love to say check out /r/aquaponics, but that place is often a ghost town. Check out Aquaponic Gardening by Sylvia Bernstein, or any number of specialized aquaponics forums.

Corporations, lobbyists and other malicious organizations have realized its potential as a tool for propaganda and are using it as such -- disturbingly effectively. Here's my personal opinion on why I think it's so dangerously effective:1. It is a completely virtual medium which can easily, cheaply and extremely quickly convey information. It's very easy to reach an extreme level of exposure compared to traditional media, by using bots for example.2. Because of its interactive nature, people *choose* what they see, read and hear. This happens consciously as well as subconsciously, which means the information they are exposed to on hot button topics is biased and incomplete because of people's preconceptions. People choose to read and watch things that validate and enforce their views.3. Because more and more content on the internet is user generated, more and more information people receive is incomplete, incorrect and skewed, both unintentionally because of bias and ignorance as well as intentionally by people feeding misinformation that suits their personal views or agenda.4. Because of the trend mentioned in point 3, malicious organizations have unprecedented power to feed people misinformation and influence their views and opinions. They can manipulate and create content on sites like Reddit. They can disguise lies as truths, propaganda as science fact. They can pose as lots of real people voicing their opinions, manipulating our view of the rest of the population. Propaganda is becoming increasingly convincing because of this.5. Maybe most importantly: **Most people are partially or completely unaware of these things**. People around the world are used to the old media, like newspapers and TV. Those media are **monitored and held accountable**, at least to a certain degree and in developed, democratic countries in particular. Professional journalists have good intentions and a strong work ethic, striving for true impartiality, objectivity and full disclosure. People in developed countries are used to taking information from these media at face value, without hardly any skepticism. They implicitly trust it to be correct. The internet is none of these things, obviously but the vast majority treats it the same. People need to be trained, drilled even to **question everything** they read on the net, especially concerning hot button topics. They need to be taught to check for sources when reading news. They need to be taught how to assess the credibility and trustworthiness of sources of information.Let's hope these issues can still be considered growing pains of the internet, as a new technology that has become too large and powerful way too quickly for society to adapt.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 42732, "stickied": false, "score": 14, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 02:59:55 2017", "ups": 14}, {"body": "THIS is why we need net neutrality", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 15, "stickied": false, "score": 7, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 03:46:05 2017", "ups": 7}, {"body": "Don't forget to tell your internet robot to email your politicians email robot so that they can get together and have lunch.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 58213, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 04:24:43 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "How can they tell the difference between a bot and those forms that people submit with their name tagged on the end?

Corporations, lobbyists and other malicious organizations have realized its potential as a tool for propaganda and are using it as such -- disturbingly effectively. Here's my personal opinion on why I think it's so dangerously effective:1. It is a completely virtual medium which can easily, cheaply and extremely quickly convey information. It's very easy to reach an extreme level of exposure compared to traditional media, by using bots for example.2. Because of its interactive nature, people *choose* what they see, read and hear. This happens consciously as well as subconsciously, which means the information they are exposed to on hot button topics is biased and incomplete because of people's preconceptions. People choose to read and watch things that validate and enforce their views.3. Because more and more content on the internet is user generated, more and more information people receive is incomplete, incorrect and skewed, both unintentionally because of bias and ignorance as well as intentionally by people feeding misinformation that suits their personal views or agenda.4. Because of the trend mentioned in point 3, malicious organizations have unprecedented power to feed people misinformation and influence their views and opinions. They can manipulate and create content on sites like Reddit. They can disguise lies as truths, propaganda as science fact. They can pose as lots of real people voicing their opinions, manipulating our view of the rest of the population. Propaganda is becoming increasingly convincing because of this.5. Maybe most importantly: **Most people are partially or completely unaware of these things**. People around the world are used to the old media, like newspapers and TV. Those media are **monitored and held accountable**, at least to a certain degree and in developed, democratic countries in particular. Professional journalists have good intentions and a strong work ethic, striving for true impartiality, objectivity and full disclosure. People in developed countries are used to taking information from these media at face value, without hardly any skepticism. They implicitly trust it to be correct. The internet is none of these things, obviously but the vast majority treats it the same. People need to be trained, drilled even to **question everything** they read on the net, especially concerning hot button topics. They need to be taught to check for sources when reading news. They need to be taught how to assess the credibility and trustworthiness of sources of information.Let's hope these issues can still be considered growing pains of the internet, as a new technology that has become too large and powerful way too quickly for society to adapt.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 42732, "stickied": false, "score": 14, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 02:59:55 2017", "ups": 14}, {"body": "Would not even surprise me if the FCC commissioner is behind it, and if it could ever be proven he should be locked up.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 38508, "stickied": false, "score": 31, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 03:10:37 2017", "ups": 31}, {"body": "THIS is why we need net neutrality", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 15, "stickied": false, "score": 7, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 03:46:05 2017", "ups": 7}, {"body": "Don't forget to tell your internet robot to email your politicians email robot so that they can get together and have lunch.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 58213, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 04:24:43 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "How can they tell the difference between a bot and those forms that people submit with their name tagged on the end?

To address the issue of AI threat, this study proposes a standard intelligence model that unifies AI and human characteristics in terms of four aspects of knowledge, i.e., input, output, mastery, and creation. Using this model, we observe three challenges, namely, expanding of the von Neumann architecture; testing and ranking the intelligence quotient of naturally and artificially intelligent systems, including humans, Google, Bing, Baidu, and Siri; and finally, the dividing of artificially intelligent systems into seven grades from robots to Google Brain. Based on this, we conclude that AlphaGo belongs to the third grade.Subjects:\tArtificial Intelligence (cs.AI)Journal reference:\tAnnals of Data Science, June 2017, Volume 4, Issue 2, pp 179-191DOI:\t10.1007/s40745-017-0109-0arXiv:1709.10242 [cs.AI]Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10242", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 46070, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 15:47:26 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "Speech recognition and database querying... what is the AI part of that ?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 92656, "stickied": false, "score": 6, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 16:03:35 2017", "ups": 6}, {"body": "> Google's AI had an IQ of 47.28accuracy != precision", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1436, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 18:27:14 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "Well that's not surprising, just a strong general intelligence beating a speech recognition system.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 132824, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 20:31:01 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "and only half as hateful as Tay?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 162556, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 01:54:25 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Still smarter than people who voted for Trump.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 65728, "stickied": false, "score": -2, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 19:53:08 2017", "ups": -2}], "subreddit": "technology", "selftext": "", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "73zukr", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Google's A.I. has nearly twice the IQ of Siri, study says \u2014 but a six-year-old child is smarter than both", "num_comments": 25, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 176, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 4088018, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/73zukr/googles_ai_has_nearly_twice_the_iq_of_siri_study/", "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 15:45:38 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Still smarter than people who voted for Trump.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 65728, "stickied": false, "score": -3, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 19:53:08 2017", "ups": -3}, {"body": "Speech recognition and database querying... what is the AI part of that ?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 92656, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 16:03:35 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "> Google's AI had an IQ of 47.28accuracy != precision", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1436, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 18:27:14 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "I really don't know how you can calculate the IQ of something that does not posses actual intelligence.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5753, "stickied": false, "score": 7, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 22:56:06 2017", "ups": 7}, {"body": "Preprint reference:Intelligence Quotient and Intelligence Grade of Artificial IntelligenceFeng Liu, Yong Shi, Ying Liu(Submitted on 29 Sep 2017)> Although artificial intelligence is currently one of the most interesting areas in scientific research, the potential threats posed by emerging AI systems remain a source of persistent controversy.

I tell them I write about movies and popular culture, analyzing the message in the medium. Most people find this exciting and want to know more. everyone goes to movies, watches television, glances through magazines, and everyone has thoughts about the messages they receive, about the images they look at. It is easy for the diverse public I encounter to understand what I do as a cultural critic, to understand my passion for writing (lots of want to write, and do). But feminist theory - that\u2019s the place where the questions stop. Instead I tend to hear all about the evil of feminism and the bad feminists: how \u201cthey\u201d hate men; how \u201cthey\u201d want to go against nature and god; how \u201cthey\u201d are all lesbians; how \u201cthey\u201d are taking all the jobs and making the world hard for white men, who do not stand a chance.When I ask these same folks about the feminist books or magazines they read, when I ask them about the feminist talks they have heard, about the feminist activists they know, they respond by letting me know that everything they know about feminism has come into their lives third-hand, that they really have not come close enough to feminist movement to know what really happens, what it\u2019s really about. Mostly they think feminism is a bunch of angry women who want to be like men. They do not even think about feminism as being about rights - about women gaining equal rights. When I talk about the feminism I know - up close and personal - they willingly listen, although when our conversations end, they are quick to tell me I am different, not like the \u201creal\u201d feminists who hate men, who are angry. I assure them I am as a real and as radical a feminist as one can be, and if they dare to come closer to feminism they will see it is not how they have imagined it.Each time I leave one of these encounters, I want to have in my hand a little book so that I can say, read this book, and it will tell you what feminism is, what the movement is about. I want to be holding in my hand a concise, fairly easy to read and understand book; not a long book, not a book thick with hard to understand jargon and academic language, but a straightforward, clear book - easy to read without being simplistic. From the moment feminist thinking, politics, and practice changed my life, I have wanted this book. I have wanted to give it to the folk I love so that they can understand better this cause, this feminist politics I believe in so deeply, that is the foundation of my political life.I have wanted them to have an answer to the question \u201cwhat is feminism?\u201d that is rooted neither in fear or fantasy. I have wanted them to have this simple definition to read again and again so they know: \u201cFeminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.\u201d I love this definition, which I first offered more than 10 years ago in my book Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center. Ilove it because it so clearly states that the movement is not about being anti-male. It makes it clear that the problem is sexism. And that clarity helps us remember that all of us, female and male, have been socialized from birth on to accept sexist thought and action. As a consequence, females can be just as sexist as men. And while that does not excuse or justify male domination, it does mean that it would be naive and wrong-minded for feminist thinkers to see the movement as simplistically being for women against men. To end patriarchy (another way of naming the institutionalized sexism) we need to be clear that we are all participants in perpetuating sexism until we change our minds and hearts, until we let go of sexist thought and action and replace it with feminist thought and action.Males as a group have and do benefit the most from patriarchy, from the assumption that they are superior to females and should rule over us. But those benefits have come with a price. In return for all the goodies men receive from patriarchy, they are required to dominate women, to exploit and oppress us, using violence if they must to keep patriarchy intact. Most men find it difficult to be patriarchs. Most men are disturbed by hatred and fear of women, by male violence against women, even the men who perpetuate this violence. But they fear letting go of the benefits. They are not certain what will happen to the world they know most intimately if patriarchy changes. So they find it easier to passively support male domination even when they know in their minds and hearts that it is wrong. Again and again men tell me they have no idea what it is feminists want. I believe them. I believe in their capacity to change and grow. And I believe that if they knew more about feminism they would no longer fear it, for they would find in feminist movement the hope of their own release from the bondage of patriarchy.It is for these men, young and old, and for all of us, that I have written this short handbook, the book Ihave spent more than 20 years longing for. I had to write it because I kept waiting for it to appear, and it did not. And without it there was no way to address the hordes of people in this nation who are daily bombarded with anti-feminist backlash, who are being told to hate and resist a movement that they know very little about. There should be so many little feminist primers, easy to read pamphlets and books, telling us all about feminism, that this book would be just another passionate voice speaking out on behalf of feminist politics. There should be billboards; ads in magazines; ads on buses, subways, trains; television commercials spreading the word, letting the world know more about feminism. We are not there yet. But this is what we must do to share feminism, to let the movement into everyone\u2019s mind and heart. Feminist change has already touched all our lives in a positive way. And yet we lose sight of the positive when all we hear about feminism is negative.When I began to resist male domination, to rebel against patriarchal thinking (and to oppose the strongest patriarchal voice in my life - my mother\u2019s voice), I was still a teenager, suicidal, depressed, uncertain about how I would find meaning in my life and a place for myself. I needed feminism to give me a foundation of equality and justice to stand on. Mama has come around to feminist thinking. She sees me and all her daughters (we are six) living better lives because of feminist politics. She sees the promise and hope in feminist movement. It is that promise and hope that I want to share with you in this book, with everybody.Imagine living in a world where there is no domination, where females and males are not alike or even always equal, but where a vision of mutuality is the ethos shaping our interaction. Imagine living in a world where we can all be who we are, a world of peace and possibility. Feminist revolution alone will not create such a world; we need to end racism, class elitism, imperialism. But it will make it possible for us to be fully self-actualized females and males able to create beloved community, to live together, realizing our dreams of freedom and justice, living the truth that we are all \u201ccreated equal.\u201d Come closer.

I have a confession. A little background, I'm a female in my early 20s. I recently moved to Brooklyn after doing a little bit of college back in my hometown. My relationship with my family isn't good, my mom died and my dad was abusing me. I didn't have many friends so I decided to pack a few bags and try to start over in the city while never looking back. I couldn't continue my education after moving to NYC because it was too expensive but I tried to save some money waitressing at an expensive restaurant in TriBeCa for school. To get enough money for my rent and to save for school, my waitressing job wasn't enough. I got into webcamming or being a cam girl from a recommendation from a Reddit user. I tried a sugar baby meeting with a sugar daddy once with the help of a website but didn't like it. I didn't like the whole concept of meeting and hanging out with actual person for money. They could've been dangerous or could've harmed me. The online webcam thing seemed a lot better and safer in my eyes. I've now been camming for about half a year and I'm pretty good at it too if I say so myself. I've made enough money that I'll be able to attend school next semester and continue my education.  One day at work I was serving a man that was dining alone. I did my usual routine and talked about our specials. After I got his order written, he told me I looked familiar and that he knew me from somewhere. I didn't recognize him, I don't know that many people except my coworkers, my parents and few friends back home. I was never a popular girl until I became a bit popular online for my \"girl next door\" image cam shows. A moment later, my worst nightmare happened. \"Oh- I remember now, that internet thing you do, with the live shows.\" I guess I made a really disgusted and scared faced cause he said \"Don't worry I won't tell anyone.\" I continued with the rest of my shift uncomfortable and scared and paranoid. I didn't know that many people so I never thought that someone would've recognized me from the webcam shows. I didn't tell anyone about the creepy guy cause how I could I admit that I worked as a cam girl to my coworkers. After finishing work, I was last cut and was leaving around 2am. As I got off the subway and was walking back to my apartment. I felt kind of scared but it was normal, being a woman walking late at night, and it's kind of in the sketchier part of Brooklyn. After going back to school i had been trying to save money to move to a safer part of New York but it's more expensive.As I unlocked my door, the man from earlier came around the corner and pushed me into my apartment building. He pushed me onto the floor and started stripping his clothes. You can guess what happened next.While it was happening he told me he has been giving me stars since I started the camshows and invested so much money into me so why didn't I ever reply to his messages. I was popular as a cam model cause after my naked scenes I would talk about my viewers about my life and how I was saving up for school. I developed fans really fast due to that's meaningful topics. He said it didn't take much for him to find me. All it took was him reverse google searching one of the images on my pages which lead to my Instagram and Facebook. He found where I worked and followed me home. He told me as he raped me that I shouldn't be saying no because while I was showing my naked body on the cam shows I was secretly telling/signaling him that I wanted his hands to touch me and be inside me. After he finished he told me if I contact the police and report the rape he will reveal to my parents and boss about my cam show past. I'm kind of in shock and depressed and sad and feel so alone right now. I don't know who to talk to about this and just wanted to share or Reddit.

I've also read comments from other Redditors on this topic, which were illuminating.This might not appeal to you at all right now, but just throwing this out there: I was close with someone who was abused by her father and she found relief in taking care of animals in her spare time, to get outside herself. Personally I've also found small acts of kindness to be a breath of fresh air, listening to my friends' problems, giving them advice and support, giving money to someone on the street or to charity (RAINN being one of them), etc. Or sometimes I just binge-watch a show when I feel suffocated by a problem.Maybe this idea is too basic to even be worth suggesting but if you have time, you might consider taking up a hobby where you can make more friends in the city both for support on a regular basis and also to feel safer. Whether that's yoga or a cooking class or going to some kind of one-off event.

We both are very quiet and keep to ourselves. We've been living in this apartment complex for a few years and I haven't had any immediate issues living here until now.Just as a quick back story, lately in the past few weeks I've been noticing groups of guys just kinda standing around outside talking and doing the \"neighbor\" thing. They usually talk loud enough that I can hear them from inside my apartment without even actively listening for it. The volume doesn't bug me, but the subjects of conversation are beginning to. These dudes almost exclusively talk about the women they see walking around, which ones they've fucked and who they would like to fuck. The usual \"locker room banter\" except out in the open where everyone can hear. I've heard them talk about me and my sister and discuss our appearances at length.Now, one of these obnoxious dudes unfortunately lives on the same floor as me, basically the door across. There will be situations where I have to get to my car really quick, or just go check my mail, and this guy will be standing by the stairs talking to someone else and we'll exchange polite hellos. I thought nothing of this, until I overheard him once again talking about me to his buddies and complaining about how I will never talk to him. Hearing someone actually complaining about this really irked me for a bit since I know I've never been rude about it, but I shook it off.Probably a day later I came back home after getting some food, and there was nobody outside. I walked up the stairs to my door and made it up about halfway. There were some pretty quick steps coming up behind me and then heavy steps on the stairs I was going up. This made me hella paranoid so I looked back quickly, and there this fucking dude is! Literally on the step right behind me. As I look back he says \"hey babe!\" and starts asking me some weird question about if I used to live somewhere. I keep walking up the stairs quickly, as I politely answered his question, and then I went inside my door. This really bothered me again because the way he was talking was way too overbearing for a stranger, but at the same time I thought that maybe I was overthinking it.Fast forward to this morning, I left to go to the bank and as I was walking out to my car this guy is out there again talking to someone sitting in their car in the parking lot. He says hi and waves, and I don't pay much attention to him but I said hi quietly and continued to my car. It didn't take me long to get back, and he was still out there talking to the other person. I got out of my car, walked past him, and then approached the stairs. Once he noticed me, he shouted (an unnecessary volume, it definitely visibly startled me) something along the lines of \"Hi!! Neighbor!! You never talk at all so I'm just saying hi!\" in a pretty passive aggressive tone. I had no idea how to react to this, and I still don't.Basically I'm wondering if I should be concerned for my safety if this man is this bothered by me minding my own business. Am I overthinking this?

You have a lot of time to think and process this pregnancy, I'm completely pro choice and I know for a fact if I was to find out I was pregnant again I'd abort due to the fact that one is enough, plus I don't want to be left raising two kids on my own.Just remember a baby will change the relationship massively, if both of you don't work 50/50 on the whole parenting and helping eachother aspect then it's going to be a bumpy ride, doesn't matter who works more hours or whatever you both do the night feeds, you both change the nappies, you both clean the house.

Anyone can choose to value \"Keep\" or \"Share\", but only one. Both is entitled and demanding.  If you both prefer to keep your names, do so! No trouble, everything easy.   If one of you values Share over Keep, that person changes their name to that of their partner and they now share a name.   If you both value Share over Keep, then you can discuss and decide which name to pick, or whether to choose something new, since you know you're both up for the options. (Personally, I favour choosing the more awesome name - why on earth does Johnny Wiener choose to subject his children to the elementary school he went through??)It's simple and should be no trouble unless one of the partners is an entitled, demanding jerk.It even solves it for children in 3/4 cases, and the fourth one you'll just still need to talk about that part of the equation as well if it's going to be a consideration for you.-----Personally, we both kept our own names because we saw insufficient reason to do anything else.

I'm looking for answers on how to deal with a bad situation that I want to resolve as peacefully as possible. Me (a senior) and my best friend (a junior) are in high school and, due to a class change last week, now share a class and this issue together.Now getting to the issue at hand, for the past weeks my bf has been telling about this guy who says things to her that make her uncomfortable. She has said that he's always trying to sit next to her even when there are other seats available (keep in mind this classroom is also a computer lab so it's roomy with plenty of seats). She's told me that he calls her \"mami\" sometimes (Spanish slang for \"babe\", not something you would say to some stranger). Additionally she says he makes sexual comments every time she does something (like coughing, one time she accidently hit the table loud, etc...). In one case he asked if he could lay his head on her lap to which she said no. Apparently he doesn't understand the concept that \"no is no\" and tried again by saying \"please\" to which once again she says no. Finally realizing he wasn't going to get a yes he tells her \"Fine, I just like your legs \u2013 they're thick\". She also says that he looks at her legs a lot which would go with what he said. All these things make my bf really uncomfortable and I don't want to spend the rest of the school year having to watch her deal with this idiot. I've only been in the class twice, the first time we had to be in another classroom due to ours being used for testing and he sat somewhere else. The second day however we were back in our room, I quickly got a seat in the middle table (two person tables) and reserved the other seat for my bf. He tried sitting in the reserved seat but I stopped him so he sat in someone else's seat in the table in front of us (supporting how he tries to sit next to her despite the numerous available seats. The person who would sit there came up and told him but he said something and they went to sit somewhere else). I'm hoping that now that I'm in the class he'll back off and dial down on his inapproiate behavior but I'm also scared he won't. As her best friend I know I should do something but I'm scared of something happening to me and her. She's too shy and most likely scared to do anything which I completely understand.  I've thought of reporting him to the teacher but he'll know it was either one of us. I've thought of calling him out in front of the class if he makes another statement but this would embarrass him and make him have a grudge for me. I've thought of taking him aside and quietly confronting him about it but I feel like he would make an \"or what\" statement and I have nothing to back myself up with. I remember seeing posts where women have stopped guys from harassing them by calling them out loudly but like I said  my friend is shy and I'm sure doing that is easier said than done. I'm honestly stuck on what to do here.Tl;dr: Last week got switched to my best friend's class. For the past few weeks she's been dealing with this guy who tries to sit next to her, makes sexual comments about things she does, calls her \"mami\" (Spanish slang for \"babe\"), doesn't understand the concept of \"no is no\" when he kept asking her if he could lay his head on her lap because he \"likes her legs since they're thick\" (paraphrase), etc. Feel like I need to do something if he keeps going but I'm scared of what could happen if we take any actions to confront him.

I usually play solo because whenever I joined a guild in the past their general/Discord chats would be pretty offensive (racial slurs that they think are okay and the like). By some luck, I joined a guild this time and everyone has been incredibly nice and helpful as I've gotten back into the game -- so much as changed and I needed help navigating around. I've thoroughly enjoyed chatting with other members and helping other newcomers as well.At first I was suspicious that the guild leader liked me, but I sort of dismissed it as just being nice. But then I started feeling uncomfortable with some things he said about feeling butterflies when talking to me, sending hearts and such, reacting to one selfie I posted in the #selfie channel on the guild Discord, etc. And then yesterday he finally said that he liked me, and how I felt about it.In response, I said that I enjoy chatting with him (not a lie), but I also don't really know him nor does he know me. After I said that, he talked about how we could get to know each other with time and started the typical sort of blind-date or dating-app conversation. Which I hate. I couldn't bring myself to tell him I'm not interested in pursuing anything more than friendship.I still need help around the game and I know a lot of other guilds aren't going to be as helpful or inoffensive in terms of all the guild members, so I don't particularly want to leave the guild or unfriend the leader. Ever since my suspicions were confirmed, though, it makes me not want to log into the game even though I really enjoy playing. I don't even think I'm asking for advice; I just don't know who to explain/rant this to because none of my irl femme friends play games.

I live in a state where I am certainly not the norm. This post isn't to state my political or social beliefs on the matter. I am a 33yo white male from a completely (and I mean completely) red state.I think part of the problem is America's 'recent' need for them relative to the timeline of history. Most established countries in this world are more than 240 years old. In that 240 years we used guns to liberate ourselves from an oppressive government that was taxing without representation, we used them to expand into the wild frontier, to win a war against ourselves to attempt ending slavery, won two world wars (and multiple others), and fed ourselves. It's not been but for the last 40-50 years America has lost the 'need' for guns.... but have we really? To some, i think the answer is no. We live in a time where we are so divided as a country that we feel the need to forcefully defend ourselves is fast approaching. You can feel the tensions mounting as our presidents fail, one after another, to unify us. We aren't sure what we are going to need them for but there is an undertone that we aren't quite done with guns. The South thinks they will rise again and the government will have to let them out of their cold dead fingers. How can they overthrow the US government without guns? Those opposing know they might need guns to defend themselves. Poverty areas are littered with guns for a different reason... because they are filled with crime and police (in many situations they are simply just out manned) , society, and government do little, if anything,  to help out. Our police dont help the matter any as they are an extension of our government and routinely abuse their power and frequently use a gun to do it. Most police, however, responsibly use them to truely defend but they are only necessary because evryone they encounter has them. So where do we start? Compton? Do we leave them defenseless? Texas? HA, GOOD luck, you're goimg to have to take the nation gaurd with you. Our police? Are we going to send brave men and women into Compton without a way to protect themselves. It's all just so fresh in our minds. We all know we would be better off without them in our society but it's all just excuses because its in our countries DNA that we might need them again very soon. To me, this sums up why i believe we keep them aroumd... Better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them.In the meantime, mentally ill, politically motivated, irresponsible, irrational people pick up the nearest gun and go to work on their neighbor. It's just hard to know where to go next, we are lost on the matter as a country and we havent had and don't have the leadership in the white house, senate, or anywhere in the capitol to fix it.    Edit: thank you to so many for the support on my analysis. Please remember this is just MY analysis on why we are having a hard time as a country with gun control. REMINDER TO SOME: I AM NOT TRYING TO DRAFT LEGISLATION TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. Just having a conversation. The U.S. constitution and Bill of Rights is part of what sets us apart in a good way.

His conclusion was that it was simply not feasible.  There is no outcome where citizens who legally obtained their firearms will willingly give up their weapons the way they did in Aus.  The difference between the countries is that the United States has a relatively short history compared to many other nations and the memories of the Revolutionary war, as well as the culture those memories created, leave us with a unique perspective on the ownership of weapons.  Australia had no such revolution.  The United States would not be a nation, without the ownership of firearms by the colonists.  Our guns are very different now, to be sure....but I'm not the one you need to convince.A portion of them would also likley see such policy as a flagrant violation of the Second Amendment and defend their right to keep those weapons with violence.  I don't think these incidents would be isolated, either.  It's important to keep in mind that the number of people who legally own firearms in the United States DWARFS the number of people the United States government has in the armed forces or law enforcement....nevermind the fact that many of those individuals come from families who are staunch supporters of the 2nd Amendment themselves.

This is thanks to the cack-handed implementation of the law by the authorities without regard for the government's public image.   In the recent years Navalny has exploited the hell out of this dynamic. Every manifestation he organizes is deliberately scandalous, designed to provoke as much \"oppressive\" reaction as possible.   It more or less goes like this:   * Navalny files a notification that he's going to organize a 20k-strong rally in downtown Moscow on a weekend in the Red Square or Manezhnaya Square (both major tourist hotspots and high-sec areas adjacent to the Kremlin), or on Tverskaya street (a major 8-lane avenue that, due to the city centre's geopraphy, will cause a gridlock in several districts if it's closed for several hours for a rally) - **it gets in all the news and on all social media**.* Application denied, ostensibly due to traffic and security concerns (and of course due to the fact that it's Navalny) and a different venue is offered - usually further from the center. Navalny publicly declines and announces that he and his followers will march anyway, citing the Constitutional right to peaceful protest - **it gets in all the news and social media**.* Police warn against participating in \"illegal\" mass manifestations, promise to detain and fine participants. Navalny cries police state, calls for all supporters to march. **It gets in all the news and social media*** The Day of the march, riot police are at the scene en-masse. Orders are to not engage unless engaged and to detain anyone shouting slogans, waving transparants or otherwise indicating they are there for an \"illegal demonstration\". **Pics of riot police in gear are all over the news**.* The crowd grows bigger. Navalny's activists and avid supporters start shouting slogans. Police move in to detain - on cue, the protesters sit down on the ground so they have to be dragged to police cars for questioning - everyone's taking pictures of well-dressed intelligent-looking young men and women getting dragged around by riot police. **It's all over the news**.* About an hour in, Navalny arrives. Is immediately detained. Everyone's shouting \"SHAME\" and takes pictures. The crowd tries to block the police van. Makeshift barricades are put up, then quickly destroyed by riot police, protesters are detained. It's a loud and mostly non-violent mess. And - yep - **it's all over the news**.  * Someone in the crowd has a physical altercation with the police - is immediately subdued and detained. Later they are tried for attacking a police officer. The trial drags on for several months, usually ends in conviction and **is all over the news**.  * After several hours the crowd goes home. The police sais the manifestation gathered 2K people, Navalny says the police are lying pigs and it was 20K. It's all over social media.  * Navalny is tried for organizing an illegal manifestation and is given 15 days of administrative arrest. Navalny smiles in court and gives snide remarks that Russian justice is a sham. The pics and videos from the courtroom are **all over the news**.* Navalny tweets and blogs from his cell. After 15 days he's freed. Pics of him walking out are all over the social media.  * **RINSE, REPEAT, ENJOY BEING THE MAIN ICON OF RUSSIAN OPPOSITION**   Russian mass protest laws are an unenforceable and arguably unconstitutional PR disaster. Navalny knows that and is expert at turning this to his advantage. In my opinion, he's probably convinced that he's, at this moment, untouchable due to his relatively high levels of  public support. Without these arrests, he wouldn't be able to make the news and maintain his seemingly constant media presence.   Navalny doesn't want peaceful protest, he wants trash and mayhem because those are an important source of his high ratings and recognition.edit: grammar", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5253, "stickied": false, "score": 65, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 15:30:36 2017", "ups": 65}, {"body": "Navalny has a suspended sentence, and he was repeatedly committing administrative offences, like this one.Any ordinary citizen would go to an actual jail for violation of terms of the suspended sentence, but alas, Navalny only gets another 20 days.That's corrupt Putin-controlled Russian courts for you!", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1341, "stickied": false, "score": 9, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 15:17:23 2017", "ups": 9}, {"body": "Anyone find it completely pathetic that a leader with seemingly as much power and influence as Putin is so frightened of a little political opposition that he has to throw them in jail?

There are those who are in firm support of net neutrality \u2013 most tech giants like Amazon and Google, for instance \u2013 and there are those who are adamantly against it, including currently the FCC.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has made it very clear that he would be doing everything he can to scale back some of the regulations around Internet Service Providers (ISP) in the US and how they choose to use their networks. As part of his argument, Pai has repeatedly cited a drop in investment from wireless companies during 2016, a year after net neutrality rules took effect. However, it looks like he overlooked some important statistics from other years which could prove that there is no causation involved here.SEE ALSO:FCC website attacked following John Oliver\u2019s plea to save net neutralityThe FCC says its website saw multiple DDoS attacks following John Oliver\u2019s call for viewers to fight for net neutrality laws. Just two weeks ago, Ajit Pai unveiled a more specific plan to get rid of \u2026Brief background on net neutralityFor those of you who are not familiar with the issue, net neutrality essentially aims to regulate the wireless industry so that every content on the Internet is treated equally. Under this set of rules, networks cannot collect fees to prioritize certain information, and they cannot discriminate against websites and services that rely more heavily on data. During the Obama administration, the FCC actively advocated for and eventually approved these rules under the guidance of former Chairman Tom Wheeler.Net neutrality essentially aims to regulate the wireless industry so that every content on the Internet is treated equally.Since the 2016 election in the US and the appointment of Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC in January 2017, however, the organization\u2019s attitude towards net neutrality changed drastically. Dominated by Republican-affiliated former businessmen, the FCC now wants to undo the classification of ISPs as \u201cTitle II\u201d common carriers and gut net neutrality in order to create positive economic effects.The agency has already voted to move forward with Pai\u2019s plans, which prompted 40 tech giants to organize a day of action back in July. Fortunately, the proposal won\u2019t proceed until the FCC gathers enough public feedback over the next few months. Pai has been using this period to sway the general public, specifically by providing investment data that reportedly indicate the economic harm that net neutrality rules have created\u00ad \u2013 except, his use of the said data doesn\u2019t necessarily establish causation and is rather misleading.So, about that 9 percent drop\u2026Pai\u2019s argument for the repeal of net neutrality rules lies heavily within his economic argument: in particular, he has repeatedly cited investment data from wireless companies, which show that there was a 9 percent decrease in yearly capital expenditures by Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint in 2016. Indeed, that\u2019s a year after net neutrality was enacted, and Pai\u2019s claim is, as you may have guessed, that these rules are dissuading companies from spending money.However, there are a few problems with his argument. First, as Democrat FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn argues, 2016 was not the only year that the US saw a decline in investment from the four major carriers:By highlighting a decrease in investment between 2015 and 2016, this section was clearly written to support the false narrative that the 2015 Open Internet Order deterred wireless carriers from investing in their networks\u2026 Despite my office\u2019s request, this Report does not include data from the 19th, 18th, and 16th Competition Reports, which showed investment from all commercial wireless companies declined from $33.1 billion in 2013 to $30.9 billion in 2015. In case you missed it, those reports predated the 2015 Order. Also, despite my request, this report does not include CTIA\u2019s investment data indicating that investment per consumer measurements declined from 2006 to 2009. Just in case you missed it again, that predates the 2015 and 2010 Open Internet Orders. These statistics demonstrate that there must be other factors, other than the Open Internet Orders, that account for why wireless carriers decreased their investment in their networks.In 2010, the FCC approved a weaker set of net neutrality rules, which eventually came to an end in 2014. As Clyburn effectively indicates, investment dips have happened before 2010, despite there being no net neutrality rules, and wireless network investment actually rose shortly after the initial Open Internet Order in 2010. The investment then dipped again from 2013 to 2015, before the current net neutrality rules took effect.FCCIn response to her criticism, the FCC included an edited chart in its Mobile Wireless Competition Report to include Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint\u2019s investment data from 2010 through 2016 (see above). Before Clyburn\u2019s comment, the draft report only went back to 2013.There are many reasons behind the slight fluctuations between years, but one primary explanation is the introduction of 4G LTE. As Ars Technica explains, AT&T\u2019s comment further illustrates why minor variations from year to year are not an indication of declining competition:There is no reason to expect capital expenditures to increase by the same amount year after year. Carriers spend a lot of money to expand or upgrade networks when a new generation of technology has been introduced \u201cand then focus the next year on signing up customers and integrating those new facilities into their existing networks, and then make additional capital expenditures later, and so on.Pai has essentially cherry-picked 2016 and 2016 only to prove his point, but seen within the overall trend, his ex post facto argument is simply fallacious. If anything, the investment data are an indication of the healthy competition that\u2019s present among America\u2019s wireless companies.Pai has essentially cherry-picked 2016 and 2016 only to prove his point, but seen within the overall trend, his ex post facto argument is simply fallacious.Another issue is causation \u2013 or the lack thereof. Given the variations in expenditures over the last six years, it\u2019s hard to conclusively state that the dip in 2016 was caused by net neutrality rules.

There are those who are in firm support of net neutrality \u2013 most tech giants like Amazon and Google, for instance \u2013 and there are those who are adamantly against it, including currently the FCC.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has made it very clear that he would be doing everything he can to scale back some of the regulations around Internet Service Providers (ISP) in the US and how they choose to use their networks. As part of his argument, Pai has repeatedly cited a drop in investment from wireless companies during 2016, a year after net neutrality rules took effect. However, it looks like he overlooked some important statistics from other years which could prove that there is no causation involved here.SEE ALSO:FCC website attacked following John Oliver\u2019s plea to save net neutralityThe FCC says its website saw multiple DDoS attacks following John Oliver\u2019s call for viewers to fight for net neutrality laws. Just two weeks ago, Ajit Pai unveiled a more specific plan to get rid of \u2026Brief background on net neutralityFor those of you who are not familiar with the issue, net neutrality essentially aims to regulate the wireless industry so that every content on the Internet is treated equally. Under this set of rules, networks cannot collect fees to prioritize certain information, and they cannot discriminate against websites and services that rely more heavily on data. During the Obama administration, the FCC actively advocated for and eventually approved these rules under the guidance of former Chairman Tom Wheeler.Net neutrality essentially aims to regulate the wireless industry so that every content on the Internet is treated equally.Since the 2016 election in the US and the appointment of Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC in January 2017, however, the organization\u2019s attitude towards net neutrality changed drastically. Dominated by Republican-affiliated former businessmen, the FCC now wants to undo the classification of ISPs as \u201cTitle II\u201d common carriers and gut net neutrality in order to create positive economic effects.The agency has already voted to move forward with Pai\u2019s plans, which prompted 40 tech giants to organize a day of action back in July. Fortunately, the proposal won\u2019t proceed until the FCC gathers enough public feedback over the next few months. Pai has been using this period to sway the general public, specifically by providing investment data that reportedly indicate the economic harm that net neutrality rules have created\u00ad \u2013 except, his use of the said data doesn\u2019t necessarily establish causation and is rather misleading.So, about that 9 percent drop\u2026Pai\u2019s argument for the repeal of net neutrality rules lies heavily within his economic argument: in particular, he has repeatedly cited investment data from wireless companies, which show that there was a 9 percent decrease in yearly capital expenditures by Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint in 2016. Indeed, that\u2019s a year after net neutrality was enacted, and Pai\u2019s claim is, as you may have guessed, that these rules are dissuading companies from spending money.However, there are a few problems with his argument. First, as Democrat FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn argues, 2016 was not the only year that the US saw a decline in investment from the four major carriers:By highlighting a decrease in investment between 2015 and 2016, this section was clearly written to support the false narrative that the 2015 Open Internet Order deterred wireless carriers from investing in their networks\u2026 Despite my office\u2019s request, this Report does not include data from the 19th, 18th, and 16th Competition Reports, which showed investment from all commercial wireless companies declined from $33.1 billion in 2013 to $30.9 billion in 2015. In case you missed it, those reports predated the 2015 Order. Also, despite my request, this report does not include CTIA\u2019s investment data indicating that investment per consumer measurements declined from 2006 to 2009. Just in case you missed it again, that predates the 2015 and 2010 Open Internet Orders. These statistics demonstrate that there must be other factors, other than the Open Internet Orders, that account for why wireless carriers decreased their investment in their networks.In 2010, the FCC approved a weaker set of net neutrality rules, which eventually came to an end in 2014. As Clyburn effectively indicates, investment dips have happened before 2010, despite there being no net neutrality rules, and wireless network investment actually rose shortly after the initial Open Internet Order in 2010. The investment then dipped again from 2013 to 2015, before the current net neutrality rules took effect.FCCIn response to her criticism, the FCC included an edited chart in its Mobile Wireless Competition Report to include Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint\u2019s investment data from 2010 through 2016 (see above). Before Clyburn\u2019s comment, the draft report only went back to 2013.There are many reasons behind the slight fluctuations between years, but one primary explanation is the introduction of 4G LTE. As Ars Technica explains, AT&T\u2019s comment further illustrates why minor variations from year to year are not an indication of declining competition:There is no reason to expect capital expenditures to increase by the same amount year after year. Carriers spend a lot of money to expand or upgrade networks when a new generation of technology has been introduced \u201cand then focus the next year on signing up customers and integrating those new facilities into their existing networks, and then make additional capital expenditures later, and so on.Pai has essentially cherry-picked 2016 and 2016 only to prove his point, but seen within the overall trend, his ex post facto argument is simply fallacious. If anything, the investment data are an indication of the healthy competition that\u2019s present among America\u2019s wireless companies.Pai has essentially cherry-picked 2016 and 2016 only to prove his point, but seen within the overall trend, his ex post facto argument is simply fallacious.Another issue is causation \u2013 or the lack thereof. Given the variations in expenditures over the last six years, it\u2019s hard to conclusively state that the dip in 2016 was caused by net neutrality rules. It may be that carriers are focusing on recruiting more customers before they invest in 5G technologies. It may be that infrastructure expansion has reached a plateau for most carriers. Who knows. In fact, even if the expenditures continued to grow from right up until 2015 and then suddenly decreased, there may be a third factor that could explain this phenomenon. In other words, Pai may be claiming that there is a causal relationship when it\u2019s simply a spurious relationship.What happens now?It\u2019s possible that Pai could ultimately decide against repealing net neutrality rules due to the enormous amount of opposition. It\u2019s possible that Pai will try to move forward with his plans but be forced to stop due to legal issues. And of course, it\u2019s possible that Pai will successfully gut net neutrality rules.
