I\u2019m clearly missing something. The second point is one of their beliefs/wants that\u2019s so obvious but I didn\u2019t really notice. Why did so many people vote for trump? Outside of the many factors that lead to his popularity there is the major one. He was different. He wasn\u2019t an establishment candidate. He didn\u2019t paint a pretty picture. His told his views with little to no filter. In a way I even liked it. I didn\u2019t like what he was saying but I liked that I could probably trust him to try to do all the stupid shit. Most, not all, but most of it was clearly honest(except helping the middle class) I always thought trump fans didn\u2019t like republicans that didn\u2019t fall in line with trump and blindly liked the ones that did. They hate almost all of the establishment guys, they still rip on the ones that are nuzzled to trumps tit because they still know what they are. When the RNC trots about the \u201csame\u201d 60 yr old white guy that has been in politics forever they don\u2019t get excited. Just look at the last 25 or so odd years. What actual, legitimate, conservative values have they helped move along? They want more people like trump and nothing else. Of course they will still vote red because liberals but they don\u2019t get their base moving like it was trump. The RNC wont stop pushing establishment players because they have already been paid for and as long as they do that the hardcore trump voters will be pissed and won\u2019t vote like they did a year ago. Long story short I always assumed they liked trump from the start so anything he became was just dandy but that\u2019s not true. They desperately wanted an anti establishment candidate and still do. This is a small distinction for their love of him but massively important for 2018. If trump keeps being trump and a ton of anti establishment players don\u2019t step up this could go a lot better than expected. I\u2019m sorry my comments on this sub are always to long. I\u2019m long winded. It\u2019s a flaw. Edit: paragraphs and in parentheses I meant to say I thought it was obvious he wasn\u2019t actually going to help the middle class but I missed a word and said I believed he would, but was going to try to do most of the other things.

It's supported by Republican school board members.   And we had a giant....13% voter turnout last night with the GOP winning about 70/30.   So now a perfectly fine school will be bulldozed and who knows how much I'll pay for all of it?The areas Clinton got blitzed last year in Pennsylvania all went solid red.  And most of the area saw just a 12-15% voter turnout.   In the county I live in, nearly 6,000 more Republicans hit the \"Straight Ticket\" button with just 100 Green party members hitting it.For all the bluster about anti-establishment candidates, the entire Harrisburg region saw basically NONE run for any office, not mayor, not school board, not prothonitary...nothing. And for those who don't know the area at all, Harrisburg's county has gone blue since 2008 while its surrounding area is red.  Kerry lost most areas by 20-35 points in '04 while Obama closed that gap by 7-15 points in '08-12 and Clinton went right back to losing them by 25-40 points.  In sum?  I'm pissed off today.

GOP apprehension and lack of support on insane Trump-supported legislation (repeal ACA, etc) is precisely because they can read between the lines and understand they will pay for it at the ballot box. Trump is deeply unpopular. Chris Christie is leaving New Jersey as one of the most unpopular governors in US history. Why? Donald fucking Trump.

I avoid them, except fixing simple errors, such as the next tip.2nd tip: make small edits, like grammar errors and spelling errors, these types of edits are always welcome across all articles.  This is the NUMBER ONE way for newbies to learn wikipedia skills.3rd tip: check your fragile ego at the door. Learn the rules. Don't get butt-hurt when you break the rules, and learn from your mistakes by changing your ways.4th tip: if someone removes your edit, then ask them why and ask for a link to the specific rule or guideline so you can read and understand the rule.  If you don't want to follow the rules and guidelines, then you only have yourself to blame.  To be blunt, all websites have rules, either follow the rules, or quit whining like a little bitch when you get slapped down for not following the rules.5th tip: add [references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources) so your text can be [verified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability).

IMHO MSRs are the best alternative for future nuclear power systems (caveat: IANA nuclear engineer). They are more efficient, safer in principle, and much less likely to be used to generate bomb material. Also, as this article points out, they are amenable to being small, even \"neighborhood size\", dramatically decreasing the entry cost, the development cost, and the difficulties and cost of locating them. Their safety also at least theoretically improves the ability to locate them.Further, this technology is also a big step toward a flight-qualified nuclear reactor that could be economically put into space and even shipped to the Moon or Mars. The fuel, Thorium, is almost completely safe for shipping in rockets launched from Earth, since the radioactivity is very low and is in the form of alpha particles, which can be shielded with a single layer of aluminum foil. (Thorium is a major constituent of the sand on some popular beaches in India.)Going even farther into speculation, a small Thorium MSR (perhaps 50-100 MW, about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the one cited) could become the power source for truly powerful VASIMR or other ion drive interplanetary vehicles. Using naive extrapolation, the 200 KW VASIMR generates about 5N of thrust, so a 50MW combination of multiple larger equivalent systems could generate 1250 N. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket#Mars_in_39_days)The ill-fated (impractical?)

The attempt failed and the left wing fringes of the party shifted their support to the Liberals who historically promise to the left and rule from the right.The party elected Singh in an attempt to reclaim the left wing fringes of Canada.So far he has promised to:(1) Institute a Netflix tax and give the proceeds to Canadian producers(2) Ban all future oil projects in the country.(3) Demand an apology for LGBTQ individuals and a pardon for anyone who is gay (there actually isn't anyone alive who has Being Gay on their rap sheet).(4) And finally immediate decriminalization of drugs.So on the drug he is talking about (fentanyl) it is actually fully legal in Canada already.  No one is getting busted for taking fentanyl.  What it is, is highly regulated.  It's very difficult and next to impossible to get a home dose of fentanyl without some very serious reasons.  Doctors have been prescribing oxycontin for patients with high pain.The main source of street fentanyl is China.  It is a very cheap drug to make and sells at a very high price.  The problem isn't the fentanyl itself (although it is very easy to overdose on fentanyl) but the actual problem is that there are a lot of drugs out there that get laced with fentanyl.  It represents the vast majority of fentanyl overdoses.  They come in a pill form.  People crush them up... and then just mix them in with other shit.  It gives a \"bigger high\" but the person is unaware of where it is coming from.

I'll make one opening statement; this is a ploy for the rich Catalonian elites and politicians to get away with stealing millions of euros from the government, while pointing the finger at Madrid and other parts of Spain.In case anyone didn't know, Jordi Pujol who was the \"president\" of Catalonia from 1980 to 2003, [was already found guilty for stealing millions of euros 3 years ago.](https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21613309-jordi-pujols-confession-undermines-catalans-hopes-independence-scandal-catalonia) His son, [also named Jordi Pujol was found guilty and jailed about 7-8 months ago now](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-corruption/spanish-court-jails-son-of-former-catalonia-leader-idUSKBN17R2TT) Here's the thing a lot of new people didn't know either; Catalonia pulls this shit literally on the regular, seriously, Google Catalonia Independence Referendums for any year before this year, in case you're lazy here's [a wikipedia link about one from three years ago, and you can click on the link for the years before and after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014). What made this year different was the fact that they tried to make it binding, using federally funded government buildings such as libraries, and schools, etc.to hold them when it was strictly prohibited. They also *actually declared independence this time*. This is the main reason why the federal government actually had to step in whereas they were free to assemble and protest every year before with no issue. You'll probably ask, \"if they do it every year, why are they pushing so hard now\"? Well, my personal theory is due to the fact that, last year, [Andorra announced they'd be ending the secrecy laws of their account holders to help catch tax dodgers](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20160303IPR16944/ending-eu-citizens-bank-secrecy-in-andorra) in cooperation with European authorities. This will expose in black and white, the total amount stolen, if they were to gain some kind of sovereignty, Andorra wouldn't release this information to Madrid, and only to Catalonia, which the elites would be able to keep hidden, they want something irreversible to happen so they cannot be held accountable. This is set to be in effect starting February, 2018, so this is their hail mary attempt to try and garner international sympathy and cry political prisoner when nothing had ever happened with the police in all the other demonstrations they hold yearly. So far, the [Paradise papers implicating Xavier Trias, former mayor of Barcelona](http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/11/05/59ff7c7e268e3e6d5d8b45ce.html) showing to have sheltered 12 million euros so far leads to believe that my theory is likely correct. If a small time mayor can shelter 12 million euros, former head of provincial government already guilty and tried for hundreds of millions, imagine the ones who fled to Belgium and what they have to hide. **It is a ploy to push ultra nationalistic and ethnocentric views to polarize the province against the country**, to further divvy up the have and the have nots, and keep the poor fighting amongst themselves.Secondly, the **entire province of Catalonia** has about [7.5 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia), that's less people than *New York* **CITY** , let alone New York State, and about half as many people in Mexico city.

You need to have good apples who work at the top to keep the rest of the bad apples out. When you don't do this, situations like the one described above happen. Just from my personal experience the state agency my dad works for does not put up with this kind of stuff. My father is fairly high (not Captian or anything, but still probably top 10 at his troop) he would never get any sort of special treatment if I did anything illegal. There's no such thing as \"getting rid of a ticket\" or making other arrests disappear with his work. One major way in which they accomplish this is by logging ever single report in their computer. If any officer writes a ticket, it's all done through their computer and then printed off in their car. One they hit submit on that ticket, they cannot alter it in any major way themselves. If something does have to be altered, a request has to be made to their main headquarters at the state capital. There, not just one person can approve the change (unless it's something minor like a misspelled first name or incorrect plate numbers). If it is something major like deleting the ticket entirely, many different people must sign off on it, all of whom are at the top of the chain of command in the state. In my dad's time since they changed the system around 8 years ago, he has had to get one ticket altered. This was because the person who he arrested, gave him a fake id with his brothers information on it. He said it took almost a week to process and received many phone calls from people asking about the story. Also if you arrest someone, they have to put the information into the computer before they take them to the jail. By doing it this way, it helps eliminate many of the problems described in the sorry above. By having to have many different people involved to break a law, it greatly increases the chances someone will not want to go along with it. Also, a state major is not going to have as much incentive to break a law, have a chance at loosing his $100,000+ year salary to help some other cop or judge he probably doesn't even know. Even with this system, there's still the possibility you can just tell the cop when you pulled over who your parents are and hope they will let you off. From my experience, getting the ticket and taking care of it yourself with a lawyer is a lot better then the cop not writting you a ticket and your parent getting a phone call from the cop saying what you were doing. I personally do not say anything and just take whatever I have coming. It's a lot better than playing the \"my dad's a cop\" card and making him look like someone who raised a disrespectful son who thinks he's above the law. Word travels fast in police departments and a story like this could have a large negative  impact if he wanted a promotion. Just this year, my dad has pulled over two different son's of other troopers. One didn't say anything and my dad still let him off with a warning, he didn't even know who the kid was until he got a call from the kids father after he told his dad wanting to know the story. The other said as soon my dad walked up \"my dad in a sergeant at whatever troop\", he then proceeded back to his car, wrote the kid a ticket for the full speed and then called the kid's father and explained the situation (it was a major speed violation and the kid should have got a ticket). The kid's dad said he was glad he wrote him a ticket and thanked my dad for still being honest having integrity. It's all about the mindset they instill in the troopers and other police from day one. Start doing stuff like making tickets go away, and eventually it will snowball into a story like the one above. With all the technology, there is no reason every department should not use a system like the one in my state. Their system is also maintained by their parent agency so no one can just \"delete\" something witout a trace of evidence of logs of what they did. Also, if your state agency does not put up with nonsense like that, the county and city agencies will start to follow their tracks. Bring in good leaders and pay them decent money for what they do, and corruption is less likely to happen. Also, have a computer system which logs who does what, then if something happens, it is really easy to find out who all the bad apples are and get rid of them.

Why? Because when you abort the first born of any, nature takes its vengeance on the subsequent children... In the Old Testament, the first born of every being, animal and man, was dedicated to the Lord. There's a special punishment Christians would suggest.[23]On abortion in the case of rape:>In response to abortions in the case of rape, Marshall said, \"Your origins should not be held against you [referring to the victim's unborn child].
