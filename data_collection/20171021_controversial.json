I lived in a world that was a no-world. I cannot hope to describe adequately that unconscious, yet conscious time of nothingness. I did not know that I knew aught, or that I lived or acted or desired. I had neither will nor intellect. I was carried along to objects and acts by a certain blind natural impetus. I had a mind which caused me to feel anger, satisfaction, desire...When I wanted anything I liked,--ice-cream, for instance, of which I was very fond,--I had a delicious taste on my tongue (which, by the way, I never have now), and in my hand I felt the turning of the freezer. I made the sign, and my mother knew I wanted ice-cream. I \"thought\" and desired in my fingers.Thought without language, at least from what can be gleaned from Hellen Keller's own observations, is made up of basic desires, habits, and emotions (anger and satisfaction). Complex thoughts aren't really possible without a language to build ideas out of.

Sure, it's not exactly what you're looking for, but I think it provides some insight. The World I Live In by Hellen Keller, Page 37Before my teacher came to me, I did not know that I am. I lived in a world that was a no-world. I cannot hope to describe adequately that unconscious, yet conscious time of nothingness. I did not know that I knew aught, or that I lived or acted or desired. I had neither will nor intellect. I was carried along to objects and acts by a certain blind natural impetus. I had a mind which caused me to feel anger, satisfaction, desire...When I wanted anything I liked,--ice-cream, for instance, of which I was very fond,--I had a delicious taste on my tongue (which, by the way, I never have now), and in my hand I felt the turning of the freezer. I made the sign, and my mother knew I wanted ice-cream. I \"thought\" and desired in my fingers.Thought without language, at least from what can be gleaned from Hellen Keller's own observations, is made up of basic desires, habits, and emotions (anger and satisfaction). Complex thoughts aren't really possible without a language to build ideas out of. So thoughts like you're having, even by just asking a question such as the one you posted are really only possible because you have a language that you can think with.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": -1, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 21 13:43:59 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "In both.

Gaseous oxygen will therefore be somewhat soluble in water, albeit not much. After all, it is non-polar and the solvent is polar. However, a gases' solubility is also proportional to pressure, and inversely proportional to temperature. Basically, gases dissolve best at high pressures and low temperatures. In the case of an underwater plant, the water above it will exert a downwards pressure, and the temperature of the ocean decreases as you go deeper. Therefore oxygen is slightly more soluble in deep water. Note that temperature has a much greater effect on solubility than pressure.The fairly small amounts of oxygen we are talking about here will probably dissolve in water easily anyway, but I'd also argue that plants in deep water would be even less susceptible to forming bubbles.

They function on the photovoltaic effect. The effect is similar though.Individual atoms have energy levels, the valence level is the highest energy level that is occupied by an electron when unexcited, the ground state. There's higher levels above that that are unoccupied, and then finally there is a certain ionization energy threshold where the electron is freed. When you put a whole bunch of atoms together into a solid, each energy level shift slightly off the energy of the levels that an individual atoms has. When you have countless atoms together, you end up with basically continuous energy bands that electrons can occupy. The valence band it the highest occupied band in ground state. The band above it is the conduction band, and as the name implies electrons in it are free to conduct electricity. The bandgap is the energy difference between the highest part of the valence band and the lowest of the conduction band. Metald have zero bandgap, hence are good conductors. Insulators (at least simple crystalline solid ones) have a large bandgap. This means very few electrons are in the conduction band, be it by photons or temperature giving them the energy, and they are poor conductors. Semiconductor, like silicon from which solar panels are made from, have a small band gap in the range of a few electronvolts. So the photoelectric effect is a photon of sufficient energy to completely ionize an electron. Right at the threshold simply frees the electron, excess energy simply adds kinetic energy to the freed electron. The typically engage off the photoelectric effects in some metals is the UV range or higher energy. The photovoltaic effect relies simply on a photon knocking an electron up one level from the valence to the conduction band. You don't want to ionize the electrons. Once up into the conduction band, the build in voltage that a p-n junction has sweeps the electron away leading to an electrical current. The bandgap for silicon corresponds to near infrared photons, in the range of 1200nm. Anything near IR through visible to near UV will work. Anything higher energy and you get ionization from the photoelectric effect and it's useless. So the actual electric current itself is based on the built in barrier voltage. A higher energy photon doesn't give it more electrical energy, it's simply wasted as heat. A near IR photon is as useful to a solar panel as a red, blue, or UV photon is. A solar panel's output is based on the number of photons with energy above the bandgap, not the energy of the photons. A trillion red photons will have the same electrical output as trillion UV photons, the extra energy of the UV photons will simply go to waste. 1000W of red photons will have a higher output than 1000W of UV photons, as there are more photons in 1000W of red photons. Only a small fraction of the sun's output is UV, and a given energy of UV means even less photons given higher energy in each one. As such, UV absorbtion is really not a goal of solar panels. So if a cloud blocked visible light but let UV through (I'm not commenting on the validity of that premise), that wouldn't mean a solar panel should work at high output on a cloudy day as UV really isn't that useful.  That said, there is some wavelength tuning for solar panels. Different semiconductors have different bandgaps, so chosing the material alters the lowest end of photons it can absorb. Increasing the bandgap can get more energy out of a single photon, but you are cutting out more and more photons from contributing. The penetration depth is very important. The penetration depth, the average depth a photon makes it to before being absorbed, is wavelength dependent. The built in barrier voltage that actually moves electrons is only present right at the p-n junction, the meeting place between the two different doped (added impurities) sides. If a photon is absorbed before this, it doesn't contribute to electrical current. If it's absorbed past it, it also doesn't contribute. As such, the junction depth needs to be tuned for an optional wavelength. You can build mutiple junctions at mutiple depths and achieve very high efficiency. Tunning bandgaps to get more electrical energy out of higher energy photons, and tuning the penetration depth to be right at the junction for the photons you want. In here you could have UV tuned junction layers. These multi-junction panels far out do your typical solar panels, but only are in lab environments really. Large scale economical manufacturing isn't viable yet.  Certain organic semiconductors can also form mutiple excitons (qausi atom like particle of an electron bound to its missing spot or hole in the valence band) with a single higher energy photon. So in silicon a single IR and UV photon will only drive one electron each, but here the IR could drive one and the UV drive two.

If current is caused to flow in the base lead (by applying a voltage to it close to that of the collector, that causes even more current to flow through  the collector, and the load, to the base and then the emitter circuit. This is because the current from the base causes charge carriers to be \"attracted\" to each other at the collector base junction, that allows current to get through. If the base voltage is closer to the emitter's voltage (ground), the charge carriers are pulled away from each other at the junction, which reduces the current flow. This is way oversimplified, so physics majors, don't bother overcorrecting me - I know the actual full story - this is meant to allow a newbie to think about the concepts involved. Remember that bipolar transistors amplify current - a little bit of base current allows a lot of collector to emitter current to flow.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5727, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 21 20:40:47 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "Well transistors will actually make up logic gates like NAND or NOR.

The instructions activate and deactivate different sections of the processor that guide information through it. For example, to add two numbers:* Instruction 1: Load number A into the adder. This instruction is coded so that the pathway from memory to the adder is activated, and the adder input acquires the binary transistor voltages that equal A.* Instruction 2: Load number B into the adder. This deactivates the first pathway, and activates the pathway from a different memory location to the other input of the adder.* Instruction 3: Execute the adder.

The \"flaw\" in the RBMK design that you often hear about is the fact that they have positive void coefficients. There are some definitions to make before I explain what that means.There is a quantity called the multiplication factor (k). This tells you the ratio of the number of neutrons available for causing fission reactions in the current generation to the number in the previous generation. If you want the fission chain reaction to exactly sustain itself, without any excess or deficit of neutrons (criticality), you want k to *exactly* equal 1.You can then define another quantity called the reactivity \u03c1 = (k - 1)/k. This is just another way to gauge whether the reactor is critical (\u03c1 = 0), supercritical (\u03c1 > 0), or subcritical (\u03c1 < 0).Finally, you can define a quantity called the void fraction (x), which is simply the ratio of the volume of gas in the core to the total volume of the core. Gases have very low density compared to liquid and solid, so they're essentially transparent to neutrons. The void fraction represents the fraction of the reactor core volume which is gas (in this case, steam).The reactivity of the core depends on a lot of variables, like temperature, core density, etc. You can define various reactivity coefficients which describe how the reactivity changes when you vary a certain quantity.Finally, we define the void coefficient. This is just how the reactivity changes as a function of void fraction.\u03b1*_v_* = d\u03c1/dx.This is just how the reactivity of the core changes with void fraction. If you make a small change in void fraction, for instance by boiling a little bit of water into steam, the response of the core reactivity will bed\u03c1 = \u03b1*_v_* dx,where dx is the change in void fraction and d\u03c1 is the resulting change in reactivity. Now it's clear that if the void coefficient is positive, it means that increasing void fraction (liquid -> gas) implies an increase in reactivity, and decreasing void fraction (gas -> liquid) implies a decrease in reactivity.If you think about what that means for a second, it's clear that that's **bad**. In a well-designed reactor, you want your reactivity coefficients to be **negative**, so that you establish stabilizing negative feedback loops, rather that destabilizing positive feedback loops.If you increase the RBMK core temperature a little bit, a little bit more water boils.

That means an increase in fission rate, which means an increase in power, and an increase in core temperature. Increased temperature means more water boiling. It's a positive feedback loop. You don't want that; you want a negative feedback loop.In other kinds of reactors, like the water-moderated BWRs used outside of ex-Soviet countries, the void coefficient is negative. So if a little water boils, it leads to a *decrease* in reactivity.So that's often stated to be a flaw with the RBMK reactors.

This makes certain viruses difficult to control and eradicate by your immune system. For example, HIV uses Th4 lymphocytes and macrophages as its main replication reservoirs,  which are crucial in maintaining and coordinating immunological function via release of cytokines. By disabling T-cell mediated immunity, it leaves your body particularly susceptible to infections and tumors, as no inflammatory cytokines can be produced, leading to inadequate immunity. Other viruses like the filovirus ebola does the opposite, wherein infected monocytes undergo an OVERproduction of cytokines, leading to an induced septic state, damaging endothelial cells and increasing permeability of blood vessels, leading to catastrophic bleeding.Yet still, certain types of viruses are able to use its own or the host's cellular machinery to produce things that downregulate inflammation, or act as decoy signals which bind important inflammatory mediators. Some viruse classes (e.g. herpesvirus) steal a portion of the host cell's surface phospholipid coat as as the virion buds the cell, making it harder to be detected by the patrolling white blood cells (think of it as wearing a camouflage suit). On that note, herpesviruses can actually travel retrograde along nerve axons and take up refuge inside what are called sensory ganglions, where it remains dormant, until the host environment becomes more favorable (immunosuppression due to chronic stress, smoking, diabetes, etc.), at which time it reinitiates replication and manifests as either another outbreak or shingles, in the case of varicella zoster. In its dormant state, herpes is almost non-immunogenic and can remain stable for decades or more (hence the joke herpes lasts longer than diamonds).Last thing I want to mention: certain types of viruses (like HPV, Epstein-Barr, anf HTLV) are also capable of causing cancer. Research is being done on their pathogenesis, but current literature suggests it's a combination of viral oncogene products (e.g. E6, E7, TAX, REX proteins), increased host cell turnover rate, immunomodulation, and in the case of retroviruses, incorporation of viral DNA into critical tumor suppressor genes.

This makes certain viruses difficult to control and eradicate by your immune system. For example, HIV uses Th4 lymphocytes and macrophages as its main replication reservoirs,  which are crucial in maintaining and coordinating immunological function via release of cytokines. By disabling T-cell mediated immunity, it leaves your body particularly susceptible to infections and tumors, as no inflammatory cytokines can be produced, leading to inadequate immunity. Other viruses like the filovirus ebola does the opposite, wherein infected monocytes undergo an OVERproduction of cytokines, leading to an induced septic state, damaging endothelial cells and increasing permeability of blood vessels, leading to catastrophic bleeding.Yet still, certain types of viruses are able to use its own or the host's cellular machinery to produce things that downregulate inflammation, or act as decoy signals which bind important inflammatory mediators. Some viruse classes (e.g. herpesvirus) steal a portion of the host cell's surface phospholipid coat as as the virion buds the cell, making it harder to be detected by the patrolling white blood cells (think of it as wearing a camouflage suit). On that note, herpesviruses can actually travel retrograde along nerve axons and take up refuge inside what are called sensory ganglions, where it remains dormant, until the host environment becomes more favorable (immunosuppression due to chronic stress, smoking, diabetes, etc.), at which time it reinitiates replication and manifests as either another outbreak or shingles, in the case of varicella zoster. In its dormant state, herpes is almost non-immunogenic and can remain stable for decades or more (hence the joke herpes lasts longer than diamonds).Last thing I want to mention: certain types of viruses (like HPV, Epstein-Barr, anf HTLV) are also capable of causing cancer. Research is being done on their pathogenesis, but current literature suggests it's a combination of viral oncogene products (e.g. E6, E7, TAX, REX proteins), increased host cell turnover rate, immunomodulation, and in the case of retroviruses, incorporation of viral DNA into critical tumor suppressor genes. BROADLY speaking, all of these sort of viral \"behaviors\" are called \"virulence factors\", and there are far more than what I can describe here. Viruses are incredibly fascinating and terrifying at the same timeI.

Then he calls his conversation with a grieving widow \"very nice.\" Very nice? How about, difficult, or heart-wrenching. I would call a trip to a restaurant as very nice. Or a car as \"very nice.\" He has either so little empathy, such a small vocabulary, or both, that he describes consoling a grieving widow as \"very nice.\" He calls out NFL players for disrespecting the flag and by extension the troops, yet he as commander in chief can't be bothered to respect them himself.

Young women are also more likely to be harassed digitally and feel pressured to participate in sexual acts they may not be comfortable with. The combination of the two has led to young women feeling uncomfortable with their burgeoning sexualities. I believe this is a very relevant issue that is not getting enough attention. I would love to start a dialogue here to hear your opinions and experiences if you're willing to share.Additionally, here is a link to a survey I wrote which is aimed at young adults who can recall high school and their experiences with cell phones during those years. Please feel free to share this with others (mostly in the U.S.) if you think they would like to share their thoughts. The survey is completely anonymous.Overall I really want this to be an opportunity for women to share their experiences that were maybe difficult to deal with in high school. For me, it was the constant nagging for nude photographs from a few different boys that really drove me towards this subject.

I was on the bus back today from my internship as I always do on Thursdays and Fridays. Midway through the bus ride a man who had told me \"Bless you\" when I sneezed noticed that I had a smart phone so he asked if I can look up for him what bus he should take to get to a specific city. I told him the street to get off on and which other bus to get on in order for him to get to where he needed to be. After this followed a small conversation between us throughout my bus ride back. He seemed nice and was able to engage in conversation, so it felt normal. It was when I notified him that his bus stop was just a few streets away that I started to feel uncomfortable. When I told him about his stop, he said, \"Oh, no worries. I'll most likely just go to X city instead\". X city happens to be the city I live in, since I mentioned in our conversation which school I go to, which is in the same city I live in. He had no previous intention to come to X city before. He was supposed to go to a completely different city up north. Once my stop was near, I grabbed hold of my bag very tightly and tried to not be rude and said goodbye to him as I got off. I got off that bus quick and just immediately directed myself back to my apartment. I look back, and he's following me. I take drastic turns around the streets to make sure I wasn't just out of my mind, and I look back again, and he's there behind me. I ran as fast as I could and managed to slip into a Halloween costume store near where I lived and just roamed around the back while looking at the entrance, hoping he wasnt in there. Fortunately he wasnt there. He probably lost sight of me. I still lingered in there for a while and was shaking, made small talk with the woman cashier and left. I made it just a block from there and just couldn't move anymore. I was just so sad scared, I was shaking so bad and I wanted to cry. I then called one of my roommates asking if she could come get me and have us walk back because of what just happened. She said, \"We're coming right now. We care.\" Three of my roommates immediately arrived to where I was, and that's when I just broke down crying. We made it back safely.Roommates, thank you. Thank you for getting my call and thank you for dropping everyone and coming for me. And... Thank you for caring.

I am a cis female, 31 and  recently started using small dose of bio identical estrogen cream because I suffer from low estrogen. I experienced great benefits mood and energy wise, it fixed my overactive bladder and helped with back and joint pains. But physical effects have been weird. Mainly I seem to been loosing my thighs and butt. I am already skinny person with very little curves and muscle mass, so this totally turned me into a stick even more! I was hopping the effects will be opposite and that estrogen will help put some weight on my lower body. Also my face skin became really dry and thinner first few days, but that seems to be leveling out. My main concern is my figure! How is it even possible that estrogen can have this kind of an affect when its supposed to be responsible for your curves. Is it because estrogen is raising my cortisol and then cortisol is \"reshaping\" my body in an unhealthy way? Is it because its suppressing my testosterone, so I am loosing muscle? I will be seeing my doc next month but meanwhile I am concerned, since I am so slim these changes are very fast and visible. Does anyone have an idea why is this happening?

It took time for me to even admit to myself that what had happened was rape and not just \"a misunderstanding.\" Even admitting to having been raped to myself was such a shameful and humiliating experience that I disassociated from myself as a way to pretend that it didn't happen. That meant that although I \"knew\" something was wrong, and that I felt unsettled around the men who assaulted me, I couldn't really explain to myself why. Typically after a new sexual partner, I would feel giddy around them afterwards, even if the sex wasn't particularly great. I love sex, I find it one of life's great joys. But understanding the difference between consensual sex and rape once I had experienced both was so distasteful and embarrassing that my mind fought against believing that it had happened to me.By the point, several weeks later in each case, that I admitted that what had happened to me was a massive violation, it seemed even more crazy to then completely cut off the people who had done it to me after so much time had passed and we were still friendly. I keep trying to write out paragraphs explaining my experience and I can't even quite get the words out, so I'll skip it and just say that even though that first sexual encounter was surely rape, I still continued to sleep with him for weeks afterwards. In a way, I justified to myself that what had occurred was inevitable, it was just some confusion. I mean, I was objectively attracted to him, but in a less inebriated state, I felt that I would have negotiated my way out of a sexual situation. I hadn't wanted to sleep with him. Besides, he was my access to substances, and after my recent breakup, I was relying on them more than I ever had. See, there's a power dynamic in play. He knew I was an addict.

Man was previously\"dating\" twin sister with similar medical issues and then moved on to his current victim. Current victim I'll call Ava and the first twin he met we'll call Cindy. Both with severe social anxiety (wear dark sunglasses when out in public day/night).Man met Cindy who was more severe health issues (bipolar) and she often moves from one guy to the next. Man describes Cindy like she is an animal with diseases to Ava and she doesn't even blink at how badly he's describing her own twin sister. She goes along and agrees to whatever he says. Ava has know him for almost a year. I believe Cindy has known him for maybe two years.I heard of the issues just last month and Ava keeps saying her ex bf (never was her bf), but didn't know all the details until I read the text messages. Ava called me complaining about how he's an asshole, but it's far worse than I ever anticipated.  This guy is a sexual predator abusing both of these twins. He's done a number on Ava because no matter how badly he treats her, she continues to repeatedly text him over and over until he gets fed up and threatens to block her. The cycle repeats itself about every 2 weeks. My guess is he is just taking turns with them.He normally tells Ava \"FUCK OFF I don't want any drama\" when he's tired of dealing with her. He wants her as he said \"sex friend\" and doesn't want any relationships. She is practically begging for his attention and constantly apologizing for her behavior. He has a decent job and brags about smoking weed all his life and passing all drug tests. He claims to have served time in jail federal and state.He only talks to her when he wants sex and pills. He goes to her apartment and brings her alcohol and sometimes weed.  He asks for her \"tabs\" (XANAX).  I just want to put an end to it all. I have his # and full name. I just want him to FUCK OFF for good, but I know Ava will not stop texting him no matter what he says to her.I don't want to create any more issues, I don't want him to retaliate against them. I just want him to stop communicating with these girls. They are in late 20's but their mentality is akin to naive teenagers. They have never held any jobs, they get Social Security for their disability. A friend told me that technically, what he is doing is not illegal unless the police stop him with her prescription drugs on him. Please, I need options. I can't just sit back and let this man abuse them even if they're the ones that invite him in.  By the way, this is in Texas.  I left out the graphic sexual details that make me sick.

I think we're probably way more common than people realize, but we're reluctant to admit to it because of misguided notions of masculinity. When I was very young my parents used to go to the nearby casinos on the weekends, and before they went they dropped me off at my cousin's house. I was no older than 5. My male cousin was about 7 years older than me. Nearly every time I was left there, after his parents went to sleep he groped and fondled me and tried to get me to perform oral sex on him. I didn't understand what was happening but I knew it was weird, and he told me that I'd get in a lot of trouble if I told my parents, so I never did. I sort of buried/repressed that memory and didn't realize until my 20s what was actually going on then.When in 8th grade, a girl that I didn't like (as in she was a bully, nothing to do with attraction) stalked me in the hallways at school and she liked to grab my butt, which I didn't like and I made sure she knew. Didn't matter. She did it a handful of times after that anyway.Does sexual harassment on dating sites count? I'm straight and my profiles always make this clear. Almost all of the messages I get on dating sites are from gay men aggressively trying to convince me to \"experiment\" and stuff. Just really sexual gross stuff that comes without even having a conversation first or me indicating in any way that I'm open to that. I've been catfished twice by gay men and it's pretty strongly turned me off of online dating. I met my last/only-ever girlfriend on Tinder and she is awesome, but she's the only exception to the rule. I'm autistic and have a really tough time in face to face interactions, so online dating was pretty much the only way I had to meet anyone that didn't make me an incoherent mess on the inside.I came to TwoXChromosomes to share my story and maybe get some perspective on it because I've been seeing the #meToo campaign on Facebook lately. I saw your post so I decided to share here.tl;dr - I was regularly molested/sexually assaulted by my much older cousin around when I was in Kindergarten. In middle school a mean girl used to grab me because she knew it bothered me.

Sometimes they're angry at caretakers for not educating them, other times they're hurt by others who knew but did nothing. It's possible to make sense of what happened and change the narrative from blame to a feeling of acceptance. Opening up to a good counselor is the perfect way to move forward because they won't judge, they know what to do with this information, they won't tell a soul, and they aren't entangled in your personal life. Allowing a caring and understanding person to hear and validate our suffering is a powerful way to begin to heal from a traumatic experience.

The recent \"me too\" posts on Facebook brought back some bad memories. I didn't add my voice to it because I didn't want to open that door to the people that know me and I still don't feel comfortable talking about it 30 years later. I've been thinking about it though and I felt like I should share my perspective because others doing so empowered me.I was dirt poor and a neglected child. I didn't know it at the time but sometimes I'll recall things that viscerally validates my perspective. My poverty and neglect must have been obvious to many and especially so to my abuser. My abuser worked in the school library. We would have library classes once a week where we learned about the Dewey Decimal system and how to use any available resources.My abuser was an older woman. I can't even recall who she is or what she looked like, but whenever we went she would take me aside and fondle me from outside my clothes. I didn't understand what was happening and assumed she didn't realize that her hand was there. I dreaded going there. It happened every time for years. Then one day, I don't know why, I realized that it was intentional and I became angry. My solution was to bring a pocket knife and stab her in her hand. I was terrified that she would move her hand and I would stab myself but I thought it was a risk worth taking. I don't know why, maybe she just saw the anger in my eyes or something, but she avoided me that day and never came near me again.I completely forgot about this. The \"me too\" posts brought the memory back. I was a small child and she was comparatively powerful, but what I realized was that I don't have that dread and all of those feelings that I'm not smart enough to articulate anymore. I'm a large man now. I don't have to ever worry about that. I escaped from that place in my life.For many, that isn't possible. Most women are smaller than most men. They won't have the feeling of safety that being a larger man brings. They have to find a way to live and cope with that stress in a way I never had to. I can't imagine or understand that. It's  dynamic that no longer exists for me. On top of that is dealing with the disbelief of those who hear them. I didn't share my story because I was afraid of having to have any conversations about it. I didn't share because I thought people might find it to be attention seeking. I didn't share it because I was ashamed even 30 years later.

Plenty of terms apply, both technical or funny, but it would appear that \"insurgent\" is the most relevant and potent.Donald Trump and his appointees are not lawful authorities in this country, and their supporters are not law-abiding citizens with respect for American institutions or even basic morality.  They are fascistic, bloodthirsty criminals with a deep and ever-increasing hunger to dismantle our republic and piss on its ashes by any means necessary.  The term for that is **insurgency**.  And the term for them is **insurgents**.  They crossed the line from being merely wrong to being at open war with their own country quite a while ago, and we the citizenry have been patient with them for years, desperately pretending that they are something other than they are.While these people commit and cheer terrorist attacks all over America, openly call for genocide, and begin to toy with what we always knew [they will ultimately do](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/10/in-a-new-poll-half-of-republicans-say-they-would-support-postponing-the-2020-election-if-trump-proposed-it/?utm_term=.4f51b447a27b), we pretend and still allow our public officials to pretend this situation is not what it is.  But reality does not flow into make-believe like water into a glass - it does not become whatever you insist strongly enough that it is.**The Constitution has been suspended**, and the only reason any of it remains in practical effect is that these people have not yet achieved a position capable of successfully suppressing it.  But every aspect of it they are in a practical position to violate is completely defunct.  They violate it openly.  American federal institutions are under occupation by an **insurgency**, and *all* of American life is under active, persistent attack by those **insurgents**.If you agree, please attempt to make a note of using this terminology where applicable.  I believe it will help clarify things to some extent.(Edit: Very first vote is a downvote, occurring just seconds after posting.

First of all, it wasn't done by somebody that I would call a scientist, more a hobby project. It has been peer-reviewed by scientists, so that's good, but not quite the same. Second, the methodology isn't perfect, around 30 traps are all that have been used, so that's not exactly enough data for this area to have enough statistical significance to say anything except maybe that something in these specific areas changed. Third, the traps have been used for a year or two a few decades in the past, not for a long time continuously. So who can really say that the first time they tested wasn't the unusual years with too many insects, and we are right now at the norm? Or the other way around, that the low amount this year is just because the climate was bad for insects this specific year, and they will be back to normal levels in a year or two.Last, though about this one I'm absolutely not sure, I tried to find something about it but didn't find an answer that satisfied me, I don't know how universal the traps are. Maybe there was just a shift from more wasps to more bees or something, and bees are less likely to get attracted to the traps. Or any other variant, or a whole bunch of those. Maybe there was just a shift in how the population is split, not in the mass of the population.To be clear, I don't want to say the study is wrong or something, at the very least it deserves for more studies to be made in the area. I just think that the way most are reporting and talking about it isn't exactly scientific, and especially the 80% number that gets thrown around everywhere is just awful with the amount of data available. I also haven't read the other studies mentioned in the article, maybe they are more conclusive, I don't know.

But let's pretend that doesn't happened. Now we have animals down the food chain dying of lack of prey. Which one of these animals should we be caring about?  Frogs, spiders, dragonflies, and lizards are all commonly hated animals or they are loved BECAUSE they eat insects. Birds? Who cares, pigeons cost human civilization BILLIONS. The animals that eat those animals? They can find other food sources. The only concern here should be insects like bees which provide a universally loved product and service, pollination. Just because something's in danger doesn't mean it needs saving.
