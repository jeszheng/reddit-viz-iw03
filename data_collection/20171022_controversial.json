They don't want to be killing themselves 80 hours/week when they can do a much more enjoyable job 20 hours/week and spend time with family and friends - it makes little difference to their ability to attract and retain a mate.In contrast, men have to keep killing themselves 80 hours/week to attract and retain their mate.

But there\u2019s definitive evidence the Russians were seeking their influence with a specific eye on the State Department.And we were seeking to influence the Russians. How many of the entourage of the American Executive to \"Putin's Silicon Valley\" do you think were gathering intel for the CIA? Spycraft works both ways even if this author doesn't have that information.This was also during the \"Russia Reset\" period, so of course they were trying to buy influence to figure out how the State Department was going to proceed towards Russia. >**\u201cIn the end, some of this just comes down to what it always does in Washington: donations, lobbying, contracts and influence \u2014 even for Russia,\u201d said Frank Figliuzzi, the former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence.**John Solomon, the former Editor-in-chief of The Washington Times (this article's co-author) is obviously a partisan hack. The last article he wrote about this matter for the hill tried to make it sound like the FBI was investigating Clinton(s) that the Obama administration was suppressing details of. This served to fan the flames for Trump about the \"Uranium deal\" once again. The information here makes it clear it was a counter-intelligence operation around her. >Figliuzzi supervised the post-arrest declassification and release of records from a 10-year operation that unmasked a major Russian spy ring in 2010. It was one of the most important U.S. counterintelligence victories against Russia in history, and famous for nabbing the glamorous spy-turned-model Anna Chapman.Culmination of a 10-year investigation that had little to do with the Clintons. Gotta get those clicks tho.>The FBI documents show exactly what Murphy\u2019s Russian handlers wanted her to get from a Clinton-tied donor she had befriended. \u201cMaybe he can provide Murphy with remarks re US foreign policy, roumors (sic) about White House internal kitchen, invite her to major venues,\u201d one FBI document quoted the Russians as saying.>By 2010, the Russian SVR urged Murphy to consider taking a job with a lobbying firm because \u201cthis position would expose her to prospective contacts and potential sources in U.S. government,\u201d the FBI affidavit read.>Figliuzzi said it was the FBI's belief that Murphy wasn\u2019t going to risk taking a job inside the State Department, where the vetting process might unmask her true identity. So she aimed for a private sector job where \u201cshe could get next to people who had the jobs who could get the information she wanted from State,\u201d he said.A Foreign intelligence service was trying to get rumors about what the State department's positions were. Shocking. >But as the informant gathered evidence of the bribery scheme in early 2010, he began to hear a familiar name crop up in conversations. The Russians kept talking about ways they could win access to or favor with the Clintons, and the informant kept reporting it back to his FBI handlers.>The informant has never been publicly identified, but his lawyer told The Hill on Friday he can shed significant light to Congress on what the Russians were doing to try to win favorable treatment from the Obama administration.>\u201cI can confirm that my client while working undercover for the FBI and in the employ of the Russian energy firm TENEX witnessed numerous, detailed conversations in which Russian actors described their efforts to lobby, influence or ingratiate themselves with the Clintons in hopes of winning favorable uranium decisions from the Obama administration,\u201d attorney **Victoria Toensing** said.Note that accounting to the source's lawyer, he can describe ways in which they were *trying* to gain influence, not ways in which they *actually* gained influence. Also, I'm going to copy below from what another user posted in the last thread about this:The fact that Victoria Toensing is the attorney of the alleged FBI informant makes the story more dubious.* Her son Brady Toensing was the chair of Trump's campaign in Vermont and it's the guy who asked the FBI to investigate Jane Sanders.She and her husband Joseph DiGenova have made some crazy unfounded claims before:* 2013, Joseph diGenova appeared on Fox News with his wife, Victoria Toensing, and alleged the Obama administration was threatening Benghazi whistleblowers to keep quiet. However, by that time Benghazi witnesses had already reportedly testified to the FBI, an independent review board, and spoken to Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) regarding the events of September 11, 2012. DiGenova also pushed the falsehood that soldiers were \u201crelieved of their duty because they insisted there be a military response\u201d to the Benghazi attacks, even though a military response was ordered by then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta.* On the January 5, 2016, edition of The Laura Ingraham Show, diGenova predicted that Hillary Clinton would be indicted for her private email server within \u201cthe next 60 days.\u201d Even though the FBI investigation was never a criminal investigation, right-wing media from Rush Limbaugh, to the Washington Examiner, and the Daily Mail ran with what Fox host Sean Hannity called an \u201coverwhelming\u201d case for Clinton\u2019s criminal prosecution. On July 5, 2016 -- 182 days after diGenova\u2019s prediction -- FBI Director James B. Comey announced that the investigation was closed and the FBI could not \u201cfind a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.\u201d", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 79502, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 03:21:24 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Huh.

The payday came just weeks after Hillary Clinton helped arrange for American executives to travel to Moscow to support Putin\u2019s efforts to build his own country\u2019s version of Silicon Valley, agents said.>There is no evidence in any of the public records that the FBI believed that the Clintons or anyone close to them did anything illegal. But there\u2019s definitive evidence the Russians were seeking their influence with a specific eye on the State Department.And we were seeking to influence the Russians. How many of the entourage of the American Executive to \"Putin's Silicon Valley\" do you think were gathering intel for the CIA? Spycraft works both ways even if this author doesn't have that information.This was also during the \"Russia Reset\" period, so of course they were trying to buy influence to figure out how the State Department was going to proceed towards Russia. >**\u201cIn the end, some of this just comes down to what it always does in Washington: donations, lobbying, contracts and influence \u2014 even for Russia,\u201d said Frank Figliuzzi, the former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence.**John Solomon, the former Editor-in-chief of The Washington Times (this article's co-author) is obviously a partisan hack. The last article he wrote about this matter for the hill tried to make it sound like the FBI was investigating Clinton(s) that the Obama administration was suppressing details of. This served to fan the flames for Trump about the \"Uranium deal\" once again. The information here makes it clear it was a counter-intelligence operation around her. >Figliuzzi supervised the post-arrest declassification and release of records from a 10-year operation that unmasked a major Russian spy ring in 2010. It was one of the most important U.S. counterintelligence victories against Russia in history, and famous for nabbing the glamorous spy-turned-model Anna Chapman.Culmination of a 10-year investigation that had little to do with the Clintons. Gotta get those clicks tho.>The FBI documents show exactly what Murphy\u2019s Russian handlers wanted her to get from a Clinton-tied donor she had befriended. \u201cMaybe he can provide Murphy with remarks re US foreign policy, roumors (sic) about White House internal kitchen, invite her to major venues,\u201d one FBI document quoted the Russians as saying.>By 2010, the Russian SVR urged Murphy to consider taking a job with a lobbying firm because \u201cthis position would expose her to prospective contacts and potential sources in U.S. government,\u201d the FBI affidavit read.>Figliuzzi said it was the FBI's belief that Murphy wasn\u2019t going to risk taking a job inside the State Department, where the vetting process might unmask her true identity. So she aimed for a private sector job where \u201cshe could get next to people who had the jobs who could get the information she wanted from State,\u201d he said.A Foreign intelligence service was trying to get rumors about what the State department's positions were. Shocking. >But as the informant gathered evidence of the bribery scheme in early 2010, he began to hear a familiar name crop up in conversations. The Russians kept talking about ways they could win access to or favor with the Clintons, and the informant kept reporting it back to his FBI handlers.>The informant has never been publicly identified, but his lawyer told The Hill on Friday he can shed significant light to Congress on what the Russians were doing to try to win favorable treatment from the Obama administration.>\u201cI can confirm that my client while working undercover for the FBI and in the employ of the Russian energy firm TENEX witnessed numerous, detailed conversations in which Russian actors described their efforts to lobby, influence or ingratiate themselves with the Clintons in hopes of winning favorable uranium decisions from the Obama administration,\u201d attorney **Victoria Toensing** said.Note that accounting to the source's lawyer, he can describe ways in which they were *trying* to gain influence, not ways in which they *actually* gained influence. Also, I'm going to copy below from what another user posted in the last thread about this:The fact that Victoria Toensing is the attorney of the alleged FBI informant makes the story more dubious.* Her son Brady Toensing was the chair of Trump's campaign in Vermont and it's the guy who asked the FBI to investigate Jane Sanders.She and her husband Joseph DiGenova have made some crazy unfounded claims before:* 2013, Joseph diGenova appeared on Fox News with his wife, Victoria Toensing, and alleged the Obama administration was threatening Benghazi whistleblowers to keep quiet. However, by that time Benghazi witnesses had already reportedly testified to the FBI, an independent review board, and spoken to Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) regarding the events of September 11, 2012. DiGenova also pushed the falsehood that soldiers were \u201crelieved of their duty because they insisted there be a military response\u201d to the Benghazi attacks, even though a military response was ordered by then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta.* On the January 5, 2016, edition of The Laura Ingraham Show, diGenova predicted that Hillary Clinton would be indicted for her private email server within \u201cthe next 60 days.\u201d Even though the FBI investigation was never a criminal investigation, right-wing media from Rush Limbaugh, to the Washington Examiner, and the Daily Mail ran with what Fox host Sean Hannity called an \u201coverwhelming\u201d case for Clinton\u2019s criminal prosecution. On July 5, 2016 -- 182 days after diGenova\u2019s prediction -- FBI Director James B. Comey announced that the investigation was closed and the FBI could not \u201cfind a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.\u201d", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 79502, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 03:21:24 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Oh is this part II of John Solomon's Russian-supported disinfo campaign against Clinton?
