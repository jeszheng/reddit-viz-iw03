Just as our thoughts determine our behavior, so does our behavior determine our thoughts. Because of this, any healthy change in behavior (exercise, diet, social activity, etc) can wind up being vastly influential in a positive manner to alleviate the painful thoughts and feelings that stem from depression. The key to remember with this process though as a helper is to do just that, help. Don't force changes. Don't give assertion. Gently guide the depressed towards making positive changes, then enforce those changes through positive reinforcement. Of course, this is only generally speaking. The manner in which to implement this in a person's life is entirely subject to that individual.As the depressed, any change, no matter how small, is going to be tough. And by tough, I mean it literally feels like the hardest thing you've ever tried to do. And no matter how much one thinks about the action, it will appear to be an impossible task. In fact, the more one thinks about it, the higher chance there is of not doing anything at all (\"conscious does make cowards of us all\"). This is where a helper is extremely beneficial. To help the depressed take that first step, that first action. Then after that, taking the next, and so on. And of course like with any new activity, the more you do it, the easier it gets. It was this process of changing behavior and thoughts in conjunction with proper treatment (medication and therapy) that helped me the most. Through changing my behaviors I was able to gain what I had always desired most while depressed: healthy relationships with people who genuinely cared for me. Crazy really, by actively trying to not be alone, my feelings of loneliness disappeared. I owe all of that to a friend who stuck with me and helped me to help myself.Also, get some vitamin D. There is an indirect correlation between vitamin D level and depression (low vitamin D, high depression). Vitamin D is the shit you get from the sun. In the winter, to deal with more darkness and overall less sunlight, take vitamin D supplements. The kind I take is a citrus flavor. Shits delicious. 10/10 recommend Edit: Thank you to those warning of side effects to supplement use (all changes have consequences, positive or negative).

Number one thing is listen. Don't relate it back to yourself or say \"sorry could ou repeat that for me?\". Even if you didn't hear it just listen. The thing about depressed people is that they're very self-centered. Not because of selfish reasons but because the mental illness forces them to retreat into a shell which effects the way they view the world. afterwards, once they've finally said what they need to say begin asking questions about how long they've been depressed for and, most importantly, assess their level of suicidality.I actually had a therapist once say to me \"it's fine. Just keep a positive attitude.\" And even critiqued me saying \"if it weren't for your parents you wouldn't be here.\" She was fucking terrible at her job. Don't criticize a depressed person. Because, based on my own experience (edit: and its specifically thought in my course), I had to live 9months criticizing and hating myself. A depressed person is their own worst enemy. Telling them, for example, \"You're really awkward\" will make them internally displaced. \"I'm awkward? That's how most people see me. I'm a freak. I knew it. Just another reason.\"Do's is to keep them occupied. Doesn't matter if it's just walking outside, or playing video games together. The more time they have to themselves the more pain they'll have to suffer. This is one reason why depressed people have trouble sleeping. Because the sinking feeling keeps them awake. Also realize that you can't be with someone 24/7 and, eventually, that person will be left alone. It's really up to them, in those cases, to get through it.

With proper treatment they can effectively work on getting their life back on track. Edit: To add; I feel that on your own as an individual you can't, in more severe cases, do much to help a depressed person long term. You'll be able to temporarily offer comfort and support, which is good and does help a bit, but realistically won't be able to resolve whatever the root cause of the depression is.

My wife and I really didn't save that well or for college (an aunt gave us some, but we didn't really put enough away).  She wanted to stay home with the kids and I supported her in that.  And I write software, so that certainly makes it easier.Now, she is a great bargain shopper, so we did save a lot on groceries, etc., and I get bargains too on electronics, etc., but we never really saved the recommended amount for college or retirement.  There were too many expenses and my daughter did gymnastics and we took vacations (although many were driving vacations, but a few were cheap flying vacations when we had the money).Now, my daughter decided she felt led to go to a Christian private university, so I told my wife that if she wanted to go there, God would provide.  We did get a HELOC on our home just in case, but we haven't used it yet!  First, grandparents helped some, but all their life savings for her were gone the first year.  After that, we took in 2 Chinese foreign exchange students which pays about 2/3 of her tuition.Also, we invested fairly early in bitcoin (started at $50), which is now by far more than all our retirement accounts put together.  This is because I always invest enough in retirement to get the company match (because I'm not going to throw away free money), but I never go beyond that.  I did invest only in funds that are over 10% for the last 7-10 years, and this year I currently have a rate over 13%.  I don't see how \"high-risk\" is high risk if it's been consistent for 10 years, so I always go for that and only one recession year was bad in 25 years (and many people lost even more than me).I don't regret my life choices.  Our family has great memories of vacations together and you never get those years back.  I rarely see my older daughter now as she lives at college except on weekends, and then lives in her room doing homework.  So I am happy that we spent a reasonable amount while saving whenever possible, but without greatly affecting our quality of life.Best saving tips:* Bought a $450 memory foam mattress on Amazon which is nearly identical to a $3500 Tempur-pedic.* Bought a Mercedes, but it was a CLA that started at $29,900, about $1000 more than a similar Honda Accord.  So why not?  Also, I keep my cars for 10-11 years, so I only have one payment at a time.* I usually buy PC video games instead of consoles, because it's much cheaper for the same games, although I did have a Wii and Wii U and Switch (Christmas gifts).  I did buy a used XBox 360 from a friend, but after selling all but 10 games I made a profit.  Eventually I sold all that too and now I just use the controllers with my PC.* I bring lunch every day.  This saves over $5000 a year.* I cut the cord.  This saves me over $1000 a year.There are many other things you can do to save money, but cable, lunches, consoles, etc. are where I see most people waste a ton of money.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 146550, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 13 02:38:27 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "not 50 but 25, I've stopped myself from going into fancy places, live alone early or buy a new car.

He was sort of controlling but I didnt care too much. When it boiled down to arguments and they came to me I'd side with her cause she was my friend. As the progressed, he got worse and worse, and he had just gotten into gun ownership. His parents never had them and he always wanted one... So he bought 3. He bought a pistol and two rifles. The rifles I went with him got him a case and locked with it. Since I grew up with them and was military I tried to teach him gun safety. I wasn't there when he picked up the pistol.  He showed it to me when he got home with it, I went through the normal gunsafey speach and didn't think much of it. (This was before he got more controlling of her). As time went on he would have his pistol with him, in the house or car. He didn't have a CCW though so he didn't usually carry it on him. We lived in a super safe area but he was paranoid about people breaking in. Or something... I think it just made him feel big. As time went on he'd just leave it around the house. Normally I'd be good and take it up to his room and put it away. Then one day I got fed up, didn't say anything and took it apart and just left it where it was. We had decided that we were not going to live there any more and so the company we were renting from had started showing the house. Usually I was there. So I typically made sure the house as clean, the dog was put up in her kennel before the showing. Usually this is where I would catch his gun laying around. The night I got fed up with him leaving g it around d I had a long talk about it with him... So the next morning I go do the usual, let the dog out clean the house. And we have a showing, the first of two, it goes fine. I take a shower, and let the dog back out. Then I am just checking in on the dog cause it's laying on his bed and his gun is laying right out on the end table in his room. This was after the first showing. People were in there... So his girlfriend gets home, I tell her and when I did they were on the phone and he heard me say it. So I immediately get this wall of text telling me how it was rude and wrong g to take his gun apart and to stay out of his room(I never went in, just looked at the dog) and so on... So I told him if he can't be an adult with a gun I'd feild strip it, since he kept leaving it around. Then I was suddenly an asshole because I was pissed about him leaving it around. And I wasn't suppose to touch his stuff... I told him we have strangers and kids and all sorts of people walking through the house and he can't so that shit cause it's not respsible. And I won't go on my massive gun safety rant I had... But this was all in a group text between the three of us... Because he had to look macho for his girl or something. So she comes and talks to me, says she agrees with me on this and so on... Then things cool down... A week goes buy and I asked her if she could print something for me. She said yes, not a big deal. That night after I go to bed, they have a massive fight and I can hear it through the wall. The next day she gets home and tells me she's breaking up with him.The fight they had was apparently because her printing something for me meant she was taking my side in the gun safety thing from a week earlier. ... So I guess it's my fault they broke up kinda. But she figured it out, that he was control and is much happier now. I was just the catalyst.

One of the owners friends is so fucking fat that we're having to pile the weights on to get him to submerge.So he's giving the instructor shit, and the instructor being a fucking idiot doesn't realise that this is the type of guy that you just need to take it from.In fairness he wasn't the worst of them, he was just embarrassed around his friends, which never gets a good reaction from a guy, plus the instructor was actually quite shit.Anyway so we're both around him trying to get him to submerge, when the instructor just dives and pulls the guy with him. Which he absolutely shouldn't have done, it was dangerous and it scared the shit out of him.I instinctively follow them down, which I probably shouldn't have, because it gave the impression that I was pulling him down as well. So we come to the surface and the guy is furious, seriously scary angry. His friends are laughing at him, but they're also kind of angry because this nobody has embaressed their friend.The instructor thinks it's funny untill he's literally dragged out of the water, by certain men, let's call them the entourage, and only now does he think oh shit.I swear to god at this point he looks around and realises where he is.So then they drag me out and I'm screaming that I had nothing to do with it.Anyway the Captain appears and takes us both away for our own safety.The instructor fucks off but an hour or so later, he's dragged back by his bosses, to try and apologise... Anyway he didn't work again, and ended up on quite a few black lists.Myself well I did my apologising and was fired anyway.  Which meant I was in various financial difficulties, and I knew I wouldn't find a similar crew position anywhere else.Anyway one of the other girls suggested to me that I 'apologise' again, miming giving a blowjob. So I'll be honest I didn't really hesitate, he wasn't the most appealing of men, but what did it matter.The other girl had a certain 'way' with the guests, and she'd actually already shagged him.However it wasn't just a blowjob he wanted. There was a careful negotiation all with the other girl as a go between, I had to put back on the wetsuit I was wearing when we had been diving.Actually it was kind of kinky and exciting in some ways. I had to meekly apologize to him in the bar, and then he dramatically leads me away to 'work it out'.The sex was slightly ridiculous, he was quite a fat guy, and he was mainly fucking my thighs. The only way we could do it, was to bend me over the desk in the pursers office.Anyway half way through he sends me out starkers to the bar, to get him a drink, which was a kind of power move.My friend suggested that I act like I can barely walk, and all out of breath. So his friends are all cheering.I head back to the office, watch him drink for 10 more minutes, put the wet suit back on, and have him fuck my thighs for another 5 minutes.Actually all in all it kind of worked out for me. He's now looking like a big man in front of his friends, I discovered later that he'd paid the other girl to make it happen, so I decided what the fuck and took some money from him as well.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7036, "stickied": false, "score": 43, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 15:56:48 2017", "ups": 43}, {"body": "That it happened at all - me at 18 probably.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 3783, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 15:25:58 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "I was 69 with an ex early on n the relationship and she said she had to call my other ex and thank her for what she taught me.

At one point the girl told me to reach down and I started touching his dick through his pants. Girl went away. At some point I was at the ground with the guy, giving him a handjob (in his pants) while making out, kissing, and biting him. (Afterwards I realised my white shirt was full of blood - in the next morning me and some other people thought about why, and then a realised it was the guy's lips) at some point, the remaining people around the campfire left. I didn't realise this until I stood up - I told the guy I want to fuck,  and he was writing with his Domme if he's allowed to. (I went smoking and to the other people while he did so :D) He got the permission and we went into his tent, fucked,  And afterwards I told him to sleep and went back to the campfire, where only two guys were left. I mentioned that I could need some spanking, and one of the guys got his paddle and spanked me at the campfire. At some point he started fingering me and ended fisting me... the other guy left at some point and came back when we were finished.  Then I slept in the tent with second guy to cuddle, next morning he shows me some E-play (electrical stimulation) because I tested it the day before on my arm and wanted to test it on my nipples. Yeah, after the nipples I got the matching dildo (hell,that felt good in a very weird way!) And then he started penetrating me with two huge af dildos.

A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence.Why?Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey.

The absolute WORST stuff plenty of artists do (specifically rap artists) is that they pump too much low end and it makes the rest of the frequencies sound more quiet, overall ruining the point of having adjustable volume and the song itself. Seriously, it's not hard to cut out some of those annoying frequencies (just drag a param eq and shelf if, takes like 2 seconds) or properly mix their instruments (it's not that hard, literally just use some param eq and eq the tracks until the frequencies aren't clashing, takes mere minutes).

First he comes here in the fucking presidential plane with all the commodities one could think off and instead of going to most affected area he goes to a rich neighborhood and trows fucking papers towels like its a fucking concert. Our lives right now consist in planing trips to get water, since theres no running water in our homes. We\u2019re pitch black at night, at the mercy of thieves and people with bad thoughts since theres no electricity or cell phone signal. So if something happens to you though luck. So far 10 people have died from drinking river water, its a dam shame that 3.5 million Americans don\u2019t have access to drinking water, let get this straight: Americans are dead because that dint have access to clean drinking water, like in 3rd world countries. This on the American government, they could invade the island in the 1800s, they can invade the fucking Middle East like its nobody\u2019s business but they can\u2019t help fellow Americans get drinking water. Supermarkets have hour long lines and we you get in its almost empty, theres only rice and canned food. Im not complaining, it\u2019s something to eat, but seeing this orange clown saying he\u2019s going to pull FEMA when theres nearly no food on the supermarkets its hearth breaking. Just yesterday I caught my neighbors crying because they lost their roof since  Maria, FEMA tarps are nowhere to be seen and what little they had left got wet again, for the 4th time since the hurricane. I had to give them shelter since they had nowhere dry to stay. Theres still people with no communication with the outside world because of road collapses, this means no access to food, clean water, meds, first aid, doctors, pampers, formula. They\u2019re on their own if FEMA pulls out. Fuck Trump, you\u2019re a disgrace to America, you come here say having 16 dead is something to be proud about, say the budget is out whack and trow paper towel like its a fucking festival and everything is ok, the deed is done. He gave aid! HE GAVE FUCKING PAPER TOWELS SO PACK UP BOYS THE JOB IS DONE! MAGA! Also! He dedicated his trophy to us! I feel so good! I might no have drinking water next week but I have a trophy dedication! Edit: Please don\u2019t give gold to this post, research for a NPO and donate to the relief effort instead. Edit 2: Theres cell service in SOME places, like the PR-30 highway. Im posting from my car in-between calls to banks and other lenders to see how to proceed with payments. Edit 3: Im heading back home, but before I go theres a few things I would like clear up. 1) Im fine for now, I have bottled water to last for the week and I can still Make the trip to get more at distribution centers, then boil it and treat it with a recommended dose of clorox. Theres people that were less fortunate that I was. Search for nonprofits or organizations that are working with those incommunicated sectors and donate to them. 2) We\u2019re working with the neighbors to restore some of their roof, but most hardware stores in our area are closed or limited on supplies. Who would\u2019ve thought that shipping food and meds to the island is more important than shipping binding materials.4) Most banks and lenders gave a 3 month stay so we can have a breather, so we got that going for us. 3) If theres some legitimate doubt that im a Puertorican living in the island im more than willing to provide some kind of proof TO THE MODS.Glad to see this post is getting the word put, almost a month after the Hurricane things are far from normal. A few days ago we where al 25% of the island energized and just yesterday or today 15% of that collapsed so even of some services get restored they\u2019re in a delicate condition.Again, things are still hard on the island. Hospital are barely operating, water trips a weakly thing for most of us, lack of real security in the streets as police are busy with other things. Gasoline lines are still a thing, not as bad as the first days after the storm but its still there. Its hard, theres suffering almost in every corner. The storm affected the whole island, and even those that were mostly prepared like me dint expect this leven of devastation. The whole island stopped for more than a week and now its trying to start back again. Thanks for the messages and the support, its comforting to know most Americans still stand with us. I just ask that you don\u2019t forget about us, it will take years to rebuild the damage done by Maria.

[Here are the current brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#Marginal_tax_rates_for_2017). People often don't know what \"progressive taxation system\" is. Here's an example. If you're single, the lowest tax bracket is $0-$9,325 which is taxed at 10%. The next bracket is $9,326-37,950 which is taxed at 15%. If you make $9,326, you're not taxed 15%. You're taxed 10% on the *first* $9,325 then 15% on the *next* amount ($1 in this case).The difference between the two is \"marginal\" and \"effective\" tax rate. If you make $10k, your marginal tax rate is 15%. Your effective tax rate is slightly higher than 10% (10.336% to be exact). You calculate this by taking 10% from the first $9,325 and then 15% for the remaining amount.So let's take someone who earns $500k. They're in the 39.6% tax bracket. Are they paying 39.6% in taxes? No. Based on the brackets, they pay: 34.6% due to progressive taxation. However, this is prior to any deductions, credits, etc. For instance, I'm in the 28% tax bracket and I pay almost 20% tax rate through various tax-saving strategies.The argument goes like this: are you in X tax bracket? That's too high! But wait, nobody mathematically can pay that tax bracket because we all pay lower. So let's cut taxes. Who is this going to benefit? People who pay the most taxes, i.e. rich people.The problem is two-fold:* if you compare *effective* tax brackets, we're in line with many other developed countries. For instance, we're neck and neck with the UK for effective tax rates.* tax rates are typically discussing *income* tax rates. This always affects the poor and the middle class which earn \"income\". Some lower upper class are affected by this too. The upper class in general doesn't really earn \"income\". They earn \"capital gains\" through various investments. For instance, you hear those CEO's making $1 salary? Why do they do that? That's their only \"income\" and they pay 10% on that $1. The rest is capital gains because they have stock options where they pay capital gains taxes.So, the anti-tax strategy is typically this:* waive a carrot for lower tax rates on *income* to get that poor/middle class person maybe a thousand dollars a year for a few years* waive a larger carrot for upper middle class and lower upper clss where they can save a few thousand* then say that since we're cutting \"taxes\", let's also cut the capital gains tax. This PRIMARILY affects the wealthy who get most if not all their income from this. Their savings? Tens of thousands to millions.Anytime someone talks about \"cutting taxes\" and they mention the capital gains tax, they want to make wealthy people save millions of dollars while giving breadcrumbs to everyone else.Trump's tax plan is no different. It even raises taxes on middle class and lower upper class after a few years while keeping the very wealthy's taxes low.One last thing everyone should realize is this: it's a numbers game. When you cut taxes, you cut government revenue. When you cut revenue, the deficit increases which increases the debt. You have a few options to close that hole:* hope for economic stimulus. Problem is: since 3/4 of the economy is personal spending, the rich can't spend enough to make up for the hole. The poor don't earn enough to stimulate the economy. You stimulate the economy best by cutting taxes specifically for the middle class since they earn enough to spend more where those extra few thousand will make a real dent. Problem is... a lot of them will use that money for debt repayment and this is what happened during the Bush $300 checks - people didn't spend money, they paid down balances on their credit cards. This doesn't help the economy.* another way to close the budget gap is to raise fees - not taxes - on various services. This is how Mitt Romney was able to lower taxes in MA - he raised fees. However, fees are regressive since it's a fixed amount rather than an amount based on your income so this hurts the poor the most followed by middle class while it saves the wealthy money. You'll see these often in the forms of things like license renewal fees, etc.* since economic boom won't be as large and the fees won't make up the difference, it's time to cut. This means laying off government workers and cutting services. Nobody is going to cut the military so we cut social programs instead. Who does this hurt? The poor and middle class who primarily rely on those services.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 135658, "stickied": false, "score": 33, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 19:35:11 2017", "ups": 33}, {"body": "*45 is unfit for office", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 320209, "stickied": false, "score": 21, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 18:20:35 2017", "ups": 21}, {"body": "If Trump is correct, then why is he raising taxes on the Middle Class?

Two of his most senior lawyers, **criminal fraud experts Andrew Weissmann and Greg Andres**, were spotted by POLITICO **last Friday afternoon** leaving the **grand jury room at the federal courthouse**.-Last Friday, 10/6, there was [this tweet from an ABC News reporter:](https://twitter.com/MikeDelMoro/status/916381519643586561)->ABC News: Robert Mueller's team met behind closed doors today w an unknown group of attorneys & chief judge of US District Court in DC-So... that's two reports of very similar information - potentially could be the same time, place, and people (at least from the Mueller side). After the original 10/6 tweet came out, people were speculating about what that reported meeting could have been about, like seen with this [twitter thread from Renato Mariotti (former federal prosecutor):](https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti/status/916396179331731456)-> MINI-THREAD: What does news that Mueller met with the Chief Judge of the D.C. federal court and a group of attorneys mean?> 1/ This is an unusual meeting, so the purpose of this meeting\u2014whatever it was\u2014was out of the ordinary.> 2/ The best I can do is give you some educated guesses about possible purposes for the meeting.> 3/ The Chief Judge oversees the grand jury program, so this could be related to a leak or a security issue regarding a grand juror.> 4/ This could be coordination of security for an upcoming event, such as the arraignment (initial hearing) after an indictment.> 5/ **Or defense counsel could be challenging a subpoena or order that Mueller served**, and the Chief Judge heard the matter in private.> 6/ If I had to guess, I\u2019d pick the latter. Usually prosecutors wait until an investigation ends to indict, so they have all the evidence.> 7/ Leaks or security issues with a grand jury are rare (but obviously this is a very unusual case).> 8/ There may be other unusual possibilities that don\u2019t come immediately to mind, but it\u2019s certainly not something ordinary. /end-So one possibility was about this meeting could be that one's defense counsel, like Trump's lawyers, could be challenging a subpeona from Mueller... and a few days and a few Trump tweet-storms later, there a story sourced from a \"senior White House official\" saying that Trump's willing to testify (implied in the near future with the *\"If Mueller doesn\u2019t request an interview by Thanksgiving, Trump\u2019s lawyers may even force the issue by volunteering Trump\u2019s time\"* line).-So... with all that in mind, my mini-theory is that Trump has been served a Mueller order/subpoena to testify.... and that's what last friday's meeting was about... and now team Trump is trying to control the narrative by leaking this story to give the appearance that Trump's appearing \"voluntarily\" because \"such an interview could help Mueller wrap up the probe faster and dispel the cloud of suspicion over Trump\".", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 203611, "stickied": false, "score": 385, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 15:05:51 2017", "ups": 385}, {"body": "Oh man.. to be a microwave in that room.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2983, "stickied": false, "score": 307, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 13:21:25 2017", "ups": 307}, {"body": "Muller is not there for answers, He's just there to get the formal lies on the record that he'll be disproving ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1958, "stickied": false, "score": 271, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 13:48:06 2017", "ups": 271}, {"body": "\"Alright Mueller, but I need you to swear your loyalty to me.

The element of security that Rosenstein absolutely doesn't understand is that security is entirely neutral. Encryption doesn't give a shit who you are or what you're doing with it, that's why Red Team operatives have a job. And the more you try and make that tool lean towards motive-based operations wherein the \"bad guys\" can't possibly have as good of tools as the \"good guys\", you run the risk of everyone's data being compromised because you can't handle the fact that you don't know how technology works.If you don't hold certifications in encryption, or general IT work, don't talk about regulating it like you have a clue. Because you don't. Just because you can turn a computer on and access the Google doesn't mean you're some kind of cybersecurity expert with Cisco and OffSec giving you honorary CCIE's and OSCP's. But the difference between CS/IT and every other godforsaken advanced field of science is you can't go to Amazon and express order a nuclear reactor or a hydrogen rocket. But you sure as hell can go and buy the exact same tools that cybersecurity experts and hackers use every single day, thereby giving people like Rosenstein some sense of authoritative entitlement that they're some kind of cybersecurity expert.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 17804, "stickied": false, "score": 13, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 20:05:18 2017", "ups": 13}, {"body": "The only thing \"responsible encryption\" means outside of 1984's newspeak is \"use strong encryption and keep track of your secret keys\".

I prosecuted primarily sexual assaults and crimes against women and children.  However, *I am not from your jurisdiction, and this is not legal advice.*I was surprised enough, though, by your statement (probably echoing what the DA said) that you saying \"Okay\" vitiated the rape charge, that I did some quick research.  > ORS 163.375 Rape in the first degree. [Known as Rape I or Rape 1] (1) A person who has sexual intercourse with another person commits the crime of rape in the first degree if:>   (a) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the person; ....Forcible compulsion is apparently defined as:ORS 163.305:> \"Forcible compulsion\u201d means to compel by:   (a) Physical force; or  (b) a threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of immediate or future death or physical injury to self or another person, or in fear that the person or another person will immediately or in the future be kidnapped.Now, given that Oregon is (like most western legal systems) what's called a \"common law\" system, the definition of forcible compulsion will be further modified by the \"jurisprudence\" i.e. various court cases where the court has further defined that phrase. *I have not* researched the case law in Oregon, so I cannot tell you definitively, but it seems to me that the statutory definition of forcible compulsion would capture your situation - i.e. his persistence despite your repeated \"no's\" caused you to fear for your safety, impliedly.  In the jurisdiction I practiced in, a sexual assault was complete when the victim did not consent *and* the accused knew (or was reckless, etc.) that the victim did not consent.  What this seems like, to me, is *not* that the statutory law is the problem, as from the statutory definition, your case would qualify as forcible compulsion.It is either 1) the case law (judge-made law) in Oregon has held that saying \"okay\" after repeated \"no's\" vitiates rape (which I *feel* is unlikely unless Oregon is a messed up jurisdiction), or 2) the DA thinks that he/she won't be able to get a conviction because it's a \"borderline\" case, or maybe 3) the DA is simply not a good DA.In any event, I think that, even up until you said \"okay\" that his touching/coercing of you would be non-consensual (i.e. removing your clothes, and therefore assault/battery in the USA.  He was touching you without your consent, which, here anyway, is classified as an assault.  The legal system in many, many places, is filled with injustice.  A large part of that is because it is never reported on, and no one cares until it happens to them.  There is very little accountability in the legal system.  I am sorry that you are having this experience.  If it had been a case I had in my career (and it was in my jurisdiction), I would have prosecuted it.

I was 21.So many people told me not to go to the police and to handle this another way. I didn\u2019t want the attention that comes from a case like this. But something kept telling me to do more. That what happened to me was bigger than me. I was just getting angry and more and more bitter by not doing anything about what happened. I tried everything I could to stop thinking about it. I cut off everyone that knew him. I didn\u2019t talk to anyone about it. In July of 2016, after 4 \u00bd years of struggling with what to do, I contacted the Police Department in the City that this took place.7 months after the last time I saw him, I contacted my rapist via Facebook messages about the incidents that took place. He said a lot in these messages- this would later become my first substantial piece of evidence.My case had enough evidence to be assigned to an Advocate and a Detective. These two became two of the most important people in my life. I was interviewed for almost 9 hours about that year. The Detective told me that in order to get this case prosecuted, I would have to slowly work towards contacting my perpetrator. I would have to confront him again about the incident. I did. I was scared and it made me feel like I was losing myself a lot of the time- but I wanted to take this case as far as I possibly could. I wanted to be heard, and in case there were other victims I wanted to speak out. The Detective and I planned carefully. I sent the Detective every single correspondence as soon as it was over for the day. I started off by saying that I wanted to work out the past and put it behind me. I messaged him for 2 months before I made the pretext calls. The plan worked. He admitted to everything last thing- every single detail. I walked him through that day and what happened. He admitted to everything. I said no to his advances from the start. I was traveling with him and told him I wanted to just be friends. I said no to everything, and that particular day; 1 month into our travels. I was exhausted and depressed. I wanted to be alone, so I shut myself in this room. He came in and got on the bed. He said he wanted to \u201cheal\u201d me. I didn\u2019t believe in that new age bullshit. He told me that sex heals. He asked me if I would have sex with him.I said \u201cno\u201d. I didn\u2019t want him to touch me. I wanted to be alone. Anyone in their right mind would see that I was clearly closed off and not wanting to be around anyone- let alone have sex with a person I didn\u2019t know very well. He wouldn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. He kept asking. Over and over again. I was afraid. My anxiety and fear wouldn\u2019t let me move. I was frozen. I was becoming more and more confused every time he asked, or every time he made an advance that I clearly didn\u2019t want. He turned me to face him. He uncrossed my arms from my chest. He asked me again and again. I said no each time. He removed my clothes, and his and he asked again. I said no. But he kept asking. Finally, after what seemed like hours of this\u2026 I was crying, I was afraid of what would happen if I didn\u2019t cooperate and I said \u201cokay.\u201d After all, I didn\u2019t know him very well and he was being very very persistent. I didn\u2019t want to consent. I said \u201cno\u201d so many times.  I gave up fighting with him to stop. He wasn\u2019t going to stop. He knew what he wanted and he was going to get it whether I liked it or not. I was crying the entire time. I was lifeless. He didn\u2019t stop. He didn\u2019t care. He finished.During these calls, I asked him why he did it. Why he kept asking, why he didn\u2019t stop when he knew I was crying, why did he have sex with me despite me saying \u201cno\u201d over and over again? He responded with 3 words that I will never forget- \u201cPower\u2026 Lust\u2026Greed\u2026\u201dAfter the conversation led to my final questions \u201chow do you think this made me feel?\u201d He responded \u201cTraumatized.\u201d After asking \u201cwhy do you think I felt traumatized?\u201d He responded, verbatim, \u201cyou were raped.\u201d  He admitted to all of this between 2 recordings. On top of all of this overwhelming evidence, his stories between the two phone calls were very inconsistent. We were absolutely certain at this point that we had a winning case against him. Everyone agreed that it sounded like a complete confession. His confession couldn\u2019t be any more clear. The detective wrote up the warrants that weekend and was ready to book the flight as soon as I figured out exactly where he would be and once the Grand Jury made a decision.  The DA would have an answer that week.My case wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted because I said \u201cokay\u201d in the end- because \u2018no\u2019 was not the answer he was looking for\u2026 because \u201cNo\u201d was not the right answer? One word. One quiet tear-filled, whispered word.   I was overwhelmed\u2026 I AM overwhelmed.  All of us are so frustrated by this verdict. Oregon State laws surrounding consent still work to protect the rapist and not the victim. So, despite such clear evidence- by law nothing could be done. I slept in the ER the night that I was told the case wasn\u2019t going to a Grand Jury.So now, I continue to fight. I told the Detective I wasn\u2019t giving up. The investigation might be over, but I still have every piece of evidence. I want to work to get a Law passed stating that Coercion is in fact a form of rape in the State of Oregon. Coerced sex should be seen as Rape everywhere as far as I am concerned. We are outraged, but we are absolutely not giving up.Eventually, I would like for my case to be looked at again by the District Attorneys office and have this case officially sent to a Grand Jury. I still hope for him to be prosecuted and charged.I said that I wanted to take this case as far as it will go, and I meant it. I never thought of myself as an activist. I never liked to over think things. But this is something that I have to do now. I want to be an advocate for all survivors of sexual assault. \u2018No\u2019 means \u2018No\u2019- the first time.This is the first of many posts to come. I refuse to stay quiet any longer.

What this seems like, to me, is *not* that the statutory law is the problem, as from the statutory definition, your case would qualify as forcible compulsion.It is either 1) the case law (judge-made law) in Oregon has held that saying \"okay\" after repeated \"no's\" vitiates rape (which I *feel* is unlikely unless Oregon is a messed up jurisdiction), or 2) the DA thinks that he/she won't be able to get a conviction because it's a \"borderline\" case, or maybe 3) the DA is simply not a good DA.In any event, I think that, even up until you said \"okay\" that his touching/coercing of you would be non-consensual (i.e. removing your clothes, and therefore assault/battery in the USA.  He was touching you without your consent, which, here anyway, is classified as an assault.  The legal system in many, many places, is filled with injustice.  A large part of that is because it is never reported on, and no one cares until it happens to them.  There is very little accountability in the legal system.  I am sorry that you are having this experience.  If it had been a case I had in my career (and it was in my jurisdiction), I would have prosecuted it.

My friend (also Indian) recently told me about her cousin who married a man who ended up abusing her physically. She moved out and divorced him. Her family is still upset with her for \"giving up on the marriage\". It's almost expected for women in Indian culture to put up with physical abuse. I overhead a conversation with my mother and aunt and they were talking about how my father and uncle have never hit them, and how great they were for that! As if they should get some kind of commendation for not being physically abusive? It was really strange. **Financial abuse** - Women in my mother's generation was discouraged from working outside the home. My mother became a housewife, as society, family, parents expected and encouraged. She raised 4 kids. My dad made the money, and while he gave her access to some of it, he would often make unilateral financial decisions without any input from her. He spent a lot of money financing the lives of his sister and her husband (who treated my mother like garbage) against my mother's wishes (she wanted the money to go towards mine and my siblings' education).

I realize it's to prevent kidnap/rape/etc, but it still feels like I'm being treated like a child. It's worse in some other countries. **Lack of support or justice for rape and abuse victims** - Rape victims are treated pretty terribly by indian law enforcement. Lot of victim blaming. Families often discourage their daughters from going to court. Male victims almost never go to court. Beyond that, victims are often treated as if their lives are over. Rape victims aren't considered \"marriageable.\" \"Acid attacks\" are real problem in India - sometimes a man who was rejected by a woman will throw corrosive acid in her face - to horribly disfigure her, blind or kill her. Or he'll target her boyfriend.**Daughters being inferior to sons** - My parents had 4 children. 3 daughters and 1 youngest son. My parents kept having children until they had a son. A friend of mine in high school was not allowed to touch her male relatives or go into the prayer room in her house or the kitchen when she was on her period. Her brother was always the preferred child - her parents even gave him a larger bedroom than her even though he was six years younger. In Indian culture, sons are considered far more valuable, while daughters are considered a burden. Part of that is because daughters entail dowries and they're supposed to belong to their husband's family, not their birth family. In India, it's illegal to know the sex of your baby before it's born - because so many couples tried to abort after realizing they were having a daughter.

I tried making up personalities and seeing them as real people, and then what hit me was: Women have had to follow a very strict patriarchal society for a long time where the goal was to get them married off: whether by a forced marriage or a matter of being considered a business proposition or just to no longer be a liability - throughout time women have been on the receiving end of shit by having to follow their fathers/husbands and then comply with society's rules. (Of course this still happens today but there's definitely been a massive shift away from this thinking as well)It just lead me to think...of all my ancestors, how many women liked their lives? How many women were forced to have sex with their husbands (marital rape?)? How many of my grandparents loved each other? How many of my grandmothers were gay or bi? How many of my grandmothers were ever truly understood? How many of my grandfathers knew their wives?

He and I have always clicked well as friends and have hung out platonically a handful of times since the break-up without any hint of it going further. I had other mutual friends at this party so I decided it seemed fun overall and headed over. We were all drinking and having one of the best nights I'd had in a while. Somehow he and I just kept gravitating toward each other, laughing and talking. Nothing out of he ordinary happened until the end of the night when he started to get touchy and invited me over. I was having fun and had nothing else tying me down so I decided to go for it. We got to his place and were about to hook up when I insisted he wear a condom. We used to have unprotected sex when we were dating but we had been broken up for a year at this point and I obviously had no idea who he had been with during that time. He tried convincing me to change my mind, saying he couldn't feel anything with a condom on and that he didn't have an STI (even though he has never been tested). He even tried telling me he didn't have any condoms, but I knew he did. Now at this point I wanted this to happen as much as he did, but I was not willing to risk my sexual health just to get laid, so I reiterated my reasoning. He continued with his foreplay, relentlessly trying to win me over. I was getting frustrated by the fact that he wouldn't just put a condom on already, when suddenly he just tried to go for it. I kept saying, \"no\" and \"stop\" but his only response was to keep trying while saying, \"you're fine\" and \"it's fine I don't have anything,\" almost laughing as he said it as if I was being unreasonable. Finally I pushed away from him and said, \"I just really feel like you're not respecting me and what I'm asking of you right now.\" He immediately got off me and laid on the other side of the bed silently. I tried to explain myself again, and he just ignored me. I told him I wanted to have sex but I just wanted him to wear a condom and he refused, continuing to ignore me. He said that having sex with a condom was the same as not having sex at all so he wouldn't do it. We both went to sleep and that was it. I almost feel like he was punishing me, \"if we're not going to have sex my way, then you aren't going to get to enjoy it either.\" The entire situation really bothered me and obviously left me frustrated. I guess I just wanted to hear other women's experiences with men and their reluctance/refusal to use a condom, or possibly other men's thoughts on being asked to use one. I know that no one prefers to use one, but I had never been with a guy who seemed so immature about the situation. I also always felt like during our relationship he had some type of narcissistic tendencies and I wonder if this situation could be an indicator/symptom of something like that.tl;dr: my ex tried relentlessly to have sex without a condom but I insisted he use one.

It's gross, and I don't mind sharing details, honey.It used to not be so bad. It used to just make me feel full like I'd eaten three meals at once. It's gotten worse lately. I got on an ice cream binge and ate three spoonfuls of ice cream, not much I know, but it was so good.I paid for it.First it feels slightly nauseous, like you have a stone in your gullet. Then you can feel the pulsing thickness in the space just below your stomach, in your gut, something that's thickened and refuses to move.That's your poo! Congrats.After that? It all comes pouring out, if you're lucky. Diarrhea where you have to sit for a good half hour on the toilet, if you're not lucky it's popping out of both places.Down it goes, up it goes. And well, you only have one toilet. So it goes for an hour, two hours, maybe. It's violent and awful and you're gasping for breath and shaking and sobbing with your pants off to the side because of this horribleness and you can't bear to feel any sort of tighteness on your belly right now and the toilet is...let's not talk about that.Or maybe you're curled up in the bath under a shower pouring on you because you didn't make it to the toilet.Congrats on that too.And then you just feel empty. Powerless. Everything you've had that day is gone down into the sewage system, possibly. Your butt hurts, mostly because that poo really never came out, unless you eat right (perhaps it's my own refusal to eat veggies, ta) .

And when someone, a family member who just wants you to eat their world famous milk chocolate chip cookies, or a server at the restaurant just doesn't want to take your food back just because 'it's just a bit of cheese/milk', you remember the days when you could say that. That just a bit would be okay.Those days are long gone.So please, I really wish, really really wish, when someone asks you to remove the cheese or make sure there's no milk in it, don't make these little disparaging comments or think they're blowing out of porportion.
