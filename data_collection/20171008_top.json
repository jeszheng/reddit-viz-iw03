And what is a more ideal control group than other states?Your question touches on one of the central tenets of conservatism (not Republicanism - those have never been quite the same thing, and since Trump took over the party there's little similarity anymore). That all-important principle is this: an adherence to the independence of each individual state. This is why conservatives are opposed to the existence of the Department of Education. Not because they hate education, but because they feel that every state should design its own education system. States that do a bad job will quickly see the difference between them and between the states that do a good job - and people will vote with their feet if a bad state doesn't change its ways, until it does.This is why conservatives are opposed to huge federal infrastructure bills. Not because they think we don't need roads, but because they feel that every state knows its own infrastructure needs best. Why let the Senate decide how much money to allocate towards this project or that project, what percent goes to roads and what percent to railway? If this state needs more money for roads while that state needs more money for railways, if this state wants to experiment with different types of mass transit while that one just wants to focus on expanding the highways, let them. States that do a bad job will quickly see the difference between them and between the states that do a good job - and people will vote with their feet if a bad state doesn't change its ways, until it does.This is why conservatives oppose sweeping federal health care regulations and health care bills. Florida has its own special needs in the health care department due to its high proportion of retirees; Alaska has its expansive rural issues; this state has more married women and therefore needs more funding for pregnancy-related issues while that state is made up entirely of urban cities and needs more asthma specialists. But even beyond the nitty-gritty, there's the question of what kind of health care system you want in the first place. Maybe the liberals are right and a socialized medical system is the best one. We don't think they are! But if they're really sure about it, let them try it in - say - Vermont and see if it works. In the meantime, Alabama might well remove all health care regulations and let the pure free market decide. (This, by the way, is what Romney meant when he said that RomneyCare should be a \"model for the nation\" - which liberals who don't understand this basic principle of conservative philosophy took as hypocritical when he opposed applying it to the entire nation as Obamacare. He meant a model for the other states.) After fifty years, maybe we all will be living under single-payer, having seen that is the best; or maybe we'll see that a fully free and open health care market outperforms it. States that do a bad job will quickly see the difference between them and between the states that do a good job - and people will vote with their feet if a bad state doesn't change its ways, until it does.This concept of \"laboratories of democracy\" is central to conservative philosophy: we have fifty different states, let us take advantage of them! Each one should be able to do whatever it wants (within reason) to test things out. If something works in one state, other states will adopt it; if it doesn't, at least it didn't adversely affect too many people before it was canceled. This sort of competition creates innovation, the opportunity to try ideas in small areas and see if they work. High minimum wages? Low minimum wages? Guaranteed minimum income? Privatizing social security? Raising taxes? Lowering taxes? Let the states try it! And may the best policy win.Liberals believe that the more important an issue is, the more crucial it is that Congress do something about it. Conservatives believe that the more important an issue is, the more crucial it is that Congress stay the heck out of the way so that individual state legislatures (who are closer to the people affected by the issue) can deal with it properly, on a state-by-state basis. Liberals often express bewilderment as to why conservatives don't want big problems to be fixed. But it's not that they don't want the problem to be fixed - they just have a problem with selecting the furthest-removed legislative body as being the one to fix it. If it's not an issue that affects the country as a whole, such as foreign policy or certain aspects of inter-state trade or downriver water pollution or the like, it's not something Congress should be addressing at all. Unfortunately, the spokesparty for conservatism has lost its mind (and its connection to conservatism), so they haven't exactly been doing a good job explaining this logic to the American people lately - which is why the Republican health care bills have been so awful in not only concept and execution but also popularity.In short, if you want to set up laboratories of democracy that try controversial laws to see if they work, true conservatives will respond with a resounding \"Yes\".", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 21141, "stickied": false, "score": 86, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  9 00:20:38 2017", "ups": 86}, {"body": "No, the public good isn't \"as long as it is temporary\" I'm not giving up my guns or society for \"just a little while\" ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 157801, "stickied": false, "score": 64, "submission_time": "Sun Oct  8 20:54:13 2017", "ups": 64}, {"body": "I see it like thisThe law may claim that forbidding something has a certain effectAnd that may be the caseBut just because forbidding something would have some positive effect doesn't mean I support that law - because by that standard you could justify a ban on pretty much anything that can be scientifically proven to have any \"negative\" effectWhat I'm talking about is freedomDo you want a ban on sugar because it destroys your teeth?

So far from main roads and on the weekend I knew our roads will be remain unplowed for quite some time. I went to my out back deck door to look at the snow Draped trees and the still heavily falling flurries and take some pictures when I noticed foot prints leading to my door then turning around and leaving.I looked and saw that they came from my neighbor's side and thought that one of their more delinquent kids played a joke as my sledding tube on the railing was popped. I decided I'd wait till later as it was early to call their parents. I went on facebook and after scrolling for a bit I noticed one of my neighbors closer to the entrance posted \"did someone knock for me or something at my back door?\"I immediately called her, talked,  and told her I have an idea. I called the first house on the entrance and told him what was going on. He went and checked and sure enough, they were there too. Everyone started calling everyone else. I called the family at the far end and they told me there was none there. Then I got a call from my next door neighbor. She called the women that lives next to the end house. She said that there were footprints that led to her door. But none led away.We already called the police by this point but now we called them back and said that it's an emergency now. They told us the roads are still all unplowed and they can't send a plow truck to clear the way as they are a privately owned company. The woman was losing it so one of the husbands (huge bear of a man) across the road from her texted her to say he was coming over to \"invite her over\". He came and she left. We put up one guy's live feed motion recording hunting cameras facing all exits. Nothing came out. Around 7 pm a plow truck came as well as 3 cop cars. The couple she was staying with and her went to her house and stood in the doorway as the police searched. They found nothing. She begged them to keep looking so they did.Two of the cops went into the basement again. This time only one came up. He took her to the side room and we could hear hysterical crying (by now we are all out there). Me and a few of the other guys started towards the door when several police confronted us. They told us they found someone hiding under a cover opening in the stairwell that she didn't even know existed. A few minutes later a scruffy man screaming and kicking came out in cuffs and was led away.In his little camp out they found blankets she just cleaned and put away. In the room next to hers... She stayed in other people's houses for a long time before going back. Even then she wouldn't stay alone. She sold the house the next summer.He turned out to be a thrill-seeking junkie who was on probation for assault against a family member.

But, if there are bonds inside the molecule that are even weaker than the forces keeping it a solid, then adding vibration (heat) is going to break those apart before the substance can get hot enough to liquify.Wood is complicated, because it's got a ton of different substances inside it. When we make charcoal, wood is heated in an oxygen free environment. As the temperature is increased, a bunch of gases are released as water and oils evaporate, and sections of proteins decompose. Some of these gases can be condensed back into liquids, but I wouldn't call these \"melted\" wood: more that the wood released these chemicals as it was heated.Heat the wood even more, and you'll get charcoal, basically pure carbon. You could continue heating this for quite a while, up to 4000K, before it starts to change state. Unfortunately, carbon at atmospheric pressure does much the same as dry ice: it sublimates straight into a gas instead of melting. To get liquid carbon, we have to add one more factor: pressure.According to the diagram here:https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6068/what-is-known-about-liquid-carbonThere is a combination of temperatures and pressures capable of creating liquid carbon. This occurs above approx. 5000K, and 3 kBar (about 43000 PSI). As a comparison, tungsten melts at very near this combination, so you'd be long in search of an appropriate container for this reaction.Tl;dr: Yes, heating wood in an oxygen free environment to ~5000K, 3kBar pressure will lead to liquid carbon.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7403, "stickied": false, "score": 20, "submission_time": "Sun Oct  8 22:08:07 2017", "ups": 20}, {"body": "That's how you make charcoal.You do that, then heat the charcoal up to a few thousand degrees, still with no oxygen, and it evaporates directly.

The reason is that as you start heading the wood up, its constituent building blocks tend to break up before the material can melt. This behavior is due to the fact that wood is made up of a strong network of cellulose fibers connected by a lignin mesh. You would need to add *a lot* of energy to allow the cellulose fibers to be able to easily slide past each other in order to create a molten state. On the other hand, there are plenty of other reactions that can kick in first as you transfer heat to the material.If you have oxygen around you one key reactions is of course combustion. But even in the absence of oxygen there are plenty of reactions that will break up the material at the molecular level.

Trust me, I'm a stranger on the internet, this will get better and chances are you are gonna LOVE sex, because there's so many aspects to love!! Bonding, deep emotional moments, amazing physical pleasure, playfulness, laughter, getting lost in the moment, some people use sex for meditation and a spiritual practice!! Its a dynamic and fantastic thing that is in your deepest nature as a human and thats just fact. You are totally capable of getting to the point where you can truly enjoy sex! However, here is some fantastic advice to help you get from where you are to where I sense you want to be someday:First of all DITCH THIS DUDE!! The fact that you're being vulnerable enough to open up to him as your first sexual partner, and he's not creating a safe and fun place to explore means 1. He's bad at being a sexual partner and 2. He's not a nice guy. Maybe he's nice but he's too immature or dumb to figure out that you need support in exploring and finding things that you truly like (or don't like), but either way you'd be much better off with him nowhere near your genitals. He's not doing his job as your first sexual partner!! Sex is weird and awkward before it's fun because you don't know what feels good and you are not used to it so it's hard to feel comfortable enough to get much physical pleasure out of it. The job of your first partner (if they are more experienced) is to create a safe and fun and supportive space to explore and learn and teach and try new stuff. He is doing a BAD JOB. You don't suck at sex. You're new. He sucks at sex, how you feel about sex right now proves that.Second of all here is a list of resources. The best way to get comfortable with sex is to LEARN about sex. So do some reading! Listen to some podcasts. Wanna learn to give a killer blowjob? The info is out there and it may be a little odd to start learning about, but it's fun information to know!! 1. www.scarleteen.com - Tons of info on everything from sexual health to gender identity to bodies and how they really work2. Sex+ is a YouTube channel (look up Laci Green if you can't find it). They are short entertaining videos and she talks about EVERY QUESTION YOU COULD HAVE or at least almost every question. How to give a good blowjob? Wanna find your g-spot(do yourself a favor and figure out your g-spot, omg it's the best)? How to tell if your sexual partner is a douche?3. If you're into podcasts, start listening to Dan Savage on the savage love podcast. Super sex-positive, sassy gay man gives advice to people that call in with sex and relationship problems. It's entertaining and will give you a taste of a really sex positive culture. It may be a little raunchy for a 17 year old but maybe that's okay with you.4. Buy yourself a copy of the book \"Self esteem, the 3rd edition\". This isn't about sex but this book will change your life. 5. Go to a bookstore and look in the sex section. Just browse. Look at sexual positions, read about how to give a good bj, you can find so much in any ol' Barnes and Noble. 6. Get with a partner that knows how to be a good partner!! A partner who treats you like your feelings are important, and understands that your process is going to be like MOST girls process in discovering sex is: confusing and slow but eventually fucking awesome! Your boobs are great, everyone thinks theirs are wrong but they aren't. Promise. You're as hot as you feel and in 4 years you will probably feel 1000 times more sexy than you do now. That's how it was for every single one of my friends and most of us are in our late 20s and early 30s now. Ditch this guy, wait for a cool dude to come along that treats your sexual experience and pleasure like a super exciting puzzle that he gets the honor of solving, not like it's something you're not delivering on.

We have gotten to a really difficult place lately. I developed an infatuation with a coworker and it was really intense, but when he asked if I wanted to sleep with him, I said no and we moved on as polite colleagues and the infatuation burned out. I told my husband about it and he was incredibly upset. I didn\u2019t want to hide it from him and wanted to address how I was feeling because my husband and I haven\u2019t been having sex with any real regularity for years. And I felt the infatuation came from that desire for intimacy more than a desire for the other person. He was really angry with me and was asking me all these questions about, \u201chadn\u2019t he been a good provider,\u201d and \u201chadn\u2019t he made me feel safe?\u201d And I snapped, he hasn\u2019t made me feel safe and I was floored that he asked that due to our history and it really re-opened some old wounds. We had a really complicated relationship early on and there was violence, he pushed me/slapped me a few times and at one point violently raped me, but we spent some time apart and got help and ended up back together. I know it sounds cliche and stupid, but I love him. The problem we are having now is I am struggling with some of these past traumas and I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know the number of times, but I know several stand out, where he wanted sex and I didn\u2019t and I said I didn\u2019t, but he pressured me until I gave in. He didn\u2019t pressure me violently, but I wouldn\u2019t say I consented. Over the years he has raped me on a few occasions, two were violent and clearly definable as rape. Once when we were dating he held me down in bed and raped me while I cried and resisted, this was nearly 10 years ago. The other time though was more recent. When we were on our honeymoon I tried to initiate sex and he wasn\u2019t in the mood. I had put on some lingerie and was disappointed, he got very angry about it and started mocking my appearance and told me to change into something \u201csexier,\u201d and I was scared, but I did. He pushed me down on the floor and made me have sex with him. I felt so ashamed, like I was being punshied for having desire and for not being desirable enough for him. I know I should have called it off then, and I\u2019ve known I probably should for a long time before that, but I love him and I\u2019ve been with him since I was a teenager. I\u2019m getting close to the age where I can say I\u2019ve been with him for half of my life. I know it doesn\u2019t make it okay though.  This last incident was 5 years ago and I just felt like I\u2019d be such a disappointment if I got divorced right after the wedding. This whole situation has brought up so many bad memories and he wants to go to therapy for himself and as a couple, but I don\u2019t know if this is something I can push away again. When he asked me if he made me feel safe it really changed how I feel about him. I\u2019ve always been in love with him and when he said that it was like a switch was flipped. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I feel like I should give therapy a chance because I committed to him and this marriage, but I\u2019m starting to think it won\u2019t help. I\u2019m not really sure what question I\u2019m asking, or if I\u2019m just venting or looking for support, but I would love to hear some other perspectives.I guess really my question is if you\u2019ve experienced something similar how did you decide to stay or go?Edit: thank you everyone for the replies, they have been great food for thought. I am actually beginning therapy independently in the next couple of weeks, but I thought this post would help me really get more perspective and make me really think about what I\u2019m doing. Like I said, I\u2019m pretty sure that our marriage is ending, but it\u2019s still really hard to commit to ending it.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "7512s7", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "I\u2019m in a hard place in my marriage.

From your post, I\u2019m not clear on whether you\u2019re in a relationship / living together, so the below is somewhat geared to that scenario, but also useful in general. Make sure that she has a \u201csafe place\u201d that is her sacred domain. That room or whatever is where she can go when she is stressed, scared, having flashbacks, whatever. You will probably be able to go there when she\u2019s having those episodes, but maybe not. Respect that, and stand up for her if others do not respect it.  If certain actions, words or sounds trigger a reaction, don\u2019t be surprised. Read up on Post traumatic stress disorder. It will help you understand what she\u2019s dealing with on some level. Make sure she knows you believe her and are there to support her. She has had to bottle all this in and fight for herself for so long. Be her rock and shield, so she can heal. She needs that. Be patient with her, and don\u2019t take things personally. Support her with regard to counseling. She will need counseling and therapy for a long time. If she wants you to go with her, do it. If she needs to be alone, respect that.One last thing, if you get in (or stay in) a serious relationship with her, you need to understand that her having been molested so many times will probably mean that she can\u2019t enjoy sex the way a normal woman would. It may take time due to the psychological trauma. Be patient and supportive with that. It will be a source of a lot of anxiety and frustration. Sounds like she has a very good man supporting her. Keep it up!Ps: If you for some reason can\u2019t stay in a relationship with her because of your own past, be 100% honest with her as to why.

Last year me and my now girlfriend met at a narcotics anyonomos meeting and hit it off from there. From someone who didn\u2019t know her she seems like a typical preppie girl, big house in a nice neighborhood etcAfter about six months of being together she opened up to me about her past. Growing up she didn\u2019t have a father . Her mother was going through a hard time when she was ten years old and had her live with a good friend of hers until she was twelve . The women she stayed with  ended up raping her and molesting her as well as physically and verbally abusing her through the course of those two years . Not too long after, she started getting into drugs and alchlohol, getting blackout drunk every night since she was thirteen. Her addiction continued to progress through her teens as she ended up dating multiple abusive boyfriends, one of whom ended up setting her up with a heroine dealer to get raped, not once, not twice, but three times. She ended up going out on drug binges and staying away from home for long periods of times, all the while getting abused by other men and so forth, with a 50 bag a day heroin habit. By the time she was 16 her and a friend went down to cop, and ended up getting in a fight with a few gangbangers who shot him, and kidnapped her, tied her up in a basement where she was raped multiple times. She managed to get away and stole a car to get home. The ended up finding out it was her who stole the car , she didn\u2019t say a word about the kidnapping  and took all the charges. This all seems like it\u2019s straight out of a horror movie , I have never been through anything like that and I still have a hard time sleeping just hearing about it. Meeting her I had no clue, she\u2019s this quite pretty blonde girl who doesn\u2019t seem like she has ever been through anything like this . She has night terrors still and , this poor girl can\u2019t go anywhere and feel safe. I don\u2019t to make her relive anything , I don\u2019t want her to feel like a victim and I have shared my own stories of sexual abuse with her, which where nowhere near as bad as anything that she has told me. I could understand how it seems like she is making these things up for attention, but it took me a very long time to get her to open up and I would bet my life that she is being honest . It would be so far out of her character to ever do anything like that. I don\u2019t think I have ever caught her in one lie. The fact that she is alive and well today is nothing short of a fucking miracle. I could only begin to imagine how misunderstood she must have been her whole life, or how years of that living hell makes her feel to this day. I don\u2019t pity her or for view her as less than in the least, I have nothing short of respect and admiration for her , because I can understand her now and see who she really is. This girl has stuck by me through a lot, and she has played a huge role in how I view women to this day. She taught me how to stay loyal to a partner and not be with someone new every week.But I know her baggage isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. I\u2019m certain she can heal and live a comfortable life and be comfortable on her own skin again if she puts in a little work and doesn\u2019t shut down. I wish everyone know this girl like I knew her. I\u2019m with her every night trying to encourage her to reach out to a rape recovery center or maybe share some of these things with her family, or take it to the police . I\u2019m also ready to jump and seriously hurt some of these people who did these things to her, I know the heroine dealer personally and I know where he traps out of, her ex is out of jail again and I wouldn\u2019t think twice about maming this kid, but she doesn\u2019t want that, and it isn\u2019t right for me to take my own anger issues and involve it with her issues . I\u2019m not qualified to handle this,  but I made a decision to stay with her and try to do the next right thing if it doesn\u2019t begin to bring serious unnanageability into my life. But due to my own issues , it might head into the direction . Me leaving her due to her past would seriously hurt her, but I know her enough and trust her recovery enough to know she would be alright in the long run . I\u2019m not big on posting on reddit, but looking at this girl and talking to her one would have no idea . I know she is not the only one, in these things are 10 times more common than someone might think. I\u2019m on here reaching out to maybe get some feedback from someone who has been through something like this and who might be more qualified to give suggestions , and possibly relate to her . So with that I\u2019m going to wrap this up because it seems like I\u2019m rambling at this point , any feedback would mean a lot , thank you in advanced .

From your post, I\u2019m not clear on whether you\u2019re in a relationship / living together, so the below is somewhat geared to that scenario, but also useful in general. Make sure that she has a \u201csafe place\u201d that is her sacred domain. That room or whatever is where she can go when she is stressed, scared, having flashbacks, whatever. You will probably be able to go there when she\u2019s having those episodes, but maybe not. Respect that, and stand up for her if others do not respect it.  If certain actions, words or sounds trigger a reaction, don\u2019t be surprised. Read up on Post traumatic stress disorder. It will help you understand what she\u2019s dealing with on some level. Make sure she knows you believe her and are there to support her. She has had to bottle all this in and fight for herself for so long. Be her rock and shield, so she can heal. She needs that. Be patient with her, and don\u2019t take things personally. Support her with regard to counseling. She will need counseling and therapy for a long time. If she wants you to go with her, do it. If she needs to be alone, respect that.One last thing, if you get in (or stay in) a serious relationship with her, you need to understand that her having been molested so many times will probably mean that she can\u2019t enjoy sex the way a normal woman would. It may take time due to the psychological trauma. Be patient and supportive with that. It will be a source of a lot of anxiety and frustration. Sounds like she has a very good man supporting her. Keep it up!Ps: If you for some reason can\u2019t stay in a relationship with her because of your own past, be 100% honest with her as to why.

I said yes and after I took it he hugged me and I just kinda pushed him off like no dude please don't touch me. After this, a girl came up to me and put her phone in my face, asking what I thought of the guy in the picture. She zoomed in, and it was the same guy who asked if I wanted to try the drink and who hugged me. At this point, I felt uncomfortable and I told my friends I was going home and caught a Lyft home. I started feeling really drunk in the car, and when I got into my house I couldn't walk around without holding on to the walls. The whole room was spinning and I texted my boyfriend \"goodnight\" at 12:02am and passed out.I woke up at 9am the next morning feeling severely sick. I threw up over 10 times to the point where I was just vomiting stomach bile. I was getting the chills and cold sweats and found it hard to even get out of bed. I couldn't eat or drink anything without it coming back up, so I ended up not getting any fluids in me for 24 hours.  I ended up sleeping until 3pm that day. I then texted my boyfriend about what had happened the night before with the guy and he told me he was coming over to take me to the hospital to get tested for drugs. I was in the ER for about 4 hours where they gave me 2 liters of fluid via IV which was much needed and conducted a test on a urine sample. It came back negative, but the doctor said it had been over 12 hours and the drugs are usually undetectable by then, but he suspected I had been drugged. He also said the test only tests for a very few amount of drugs, but there are donzens of drugs they don't test for that could be used to incapacitate someone.This entire event was really eye opening as well as traumatizing. I am a huge proponent of women's safety and always watch my drink but even taking a picture for someone left me open to risk. I had one drink over the course of 2 hours, and was horribly sick for 24 hours. I don't remember much of yesterday and my boyfriend said I seemed very out of it. I also feel very stupid. Has anyone else had experience with this? Some of my friends don't seem to understand what I went through. They were very dismissive when I told them \"Well at least you're feeling better now\" or \"I don't know if you were, we were at the table the whole time\" ect.

We arent into exhibitionism, we just dont have anywhere else to do anything. Im not the bravest person and I suffer from really bad anxiety, so i chickened out last night. When we got there I could see headlights from cars and I just couldnt do it. He got a little mad and really pouty. So we drove to a new place (an abandoned parking lot) and I still didnt feel super secure. He then started to cry and said how he can recognize hes being an ass lately but he cant control it and that he thinks hes addicted to sex. Hes under a lot of stress right now so I just sat there and comforted him. He said his biggest fear is me leaving because i will think all he wants is sex. I reassured him that I couldnt possibly think that because we havent even had sex beyond oral (because im still a virgin.) So we cuddle a lot and he stops crying. He starts giving me a back rub and he gets aroused again. Even after all this apparent fear he has of what I will think of him, he asks me for oral again. I was annoyed but at this point just gave in to him because i wanted to make him happy and I didnt want him to think less of me. Now I just feel gross and weird. Ive been cheated on a lot in other relationships and I have really severe trust issues, and I am worried he just wants sex. Especially because nearly every time i say no he will say \"Please? Just like 2 mins.\" And it really bothers me. Why cant he get no means no? Its like he knows if he asks enough ill give in even when im scared.

We knew eachother vaguely, went out (not as a date) with a couple who are mutual friends of ours, and hit it off extraordinarily well considering he has a reputation for being very withdrawn and a bit choosy. I actually ended up going home with him that night (he lives with my best friends and old roommates) and we had an incredibly good conversation regarding arts (I'm a jazz musician; he's a poet), lots of sharing personal thoughts and music until 2am. We ended up sleeping together which was VERY unexpected but wonderful. I fell hella hard. It's been awhile since I've had conversation and connection like that. He's also pretty damn attractive, and a giant. 10/10.I'm over at his place a lot since my best friends live with him, and every time I'm over he always makes a point to say hi and chat. We've gotten caught up in long conversations again a few times and swapped book/poetry/music suggestions. Also have gotten into meatier, more personal conversation which from what I understand is very unusual for him, being quite the introvert. He's a very honest individual. Physically his body language has been very positive and he's not afraid to touch me (or accidentally body check me into a wall while playing hallway soccer). I had invited him out twice to shows, but he declined both times (midterms and he works, so I kinda figured he was overloaded anyways). We've texted a little but he's been pretty bad at getting back, I've chalked that up to him being a busy introvert. He does follow me on Twitter (and is literally the only person I talk to irl that does, lol). I went out last night with his roommates and went back to his place after, but as soon as he came out of his room, his roommates vanished and we found ourselves on the porch talking for quite awhile. Moved to his room to listen to some music and kept the conversation, completely quality, just sat there holding hands for awhile and listening/talking about life and human relationships. He read me some of his poetry, which is really damn good. He's very unhappy with his job and stretched really thin socially, even with picking his interactions it's still a lot for him. Hasn't had a real girlfriend in 6 years, just dates, which is shocking since everyone he does know seems to love him, and he's an attractive and well dressed dude, just VERY tall/ginger so maybe that turns people away? Who knows. Ended up making out and one thing led to another, slept together again, right before falling asleep I asked if we could go on a real date sometime. Sounds silly, immature, whatever but I figured I'd rather have that out so that I could start figuring out what we were since I definitely was having lots of feelings for him.\"I'm sorry, I'm just really stretched right now in a lot of different directions in my life and I'm trying to keep things simplistic. I get it if you don't want to stay the night anymore, but I do really enjoy your company and friendship, I just have to figure myself out right now.\"I get it, I told him it's okay and I understand, but I still feel hurting inside. I don't know and not sure how I feel about this. Keep going and pretend it never happened (and probably still have a casual relationship even though the feelings won't go away)? Back off/avoid for a bit because awkward? I'm not sure. I'm glad he was honest, and I do believe what he said (he's not the type to mince words or make excuses). But that still stung a bit. I'm not sure what type of relationship we'll having moving further. I hope I still have his friendship because he is literally the only person I know right now that shares a similar outlook/nerdy arts interest/I feel so comfortable with having conversations.

My experience has been you can't force these things.  If you put out what you want, that is, you ask for what you want... And you get a more or less indifference, excuse or negative... That is your answer.I think he maybe didn't want to hurt your feelings (and probably wanted to sleep with you again), he likes you in some way, but doesn't want to commit to anything.

She thought the world of him and put so much into that relationship, at the end, he had another woman fall into his lap and ended up cheating on my sister...

I'm a woman around 30, as is my roommate, who is hilarious, smart, caring, fun and supportive. I love her and I love our place. I even love her dog - sweetest dog in the world. It's also the first dog my roommate has ever had (I've had about 25 altogether, including 10 at a time when I lived at an animal rescue), and she doesn't seem to necessarily understand what a dog needs and requires. She leaves her in the crate for way too long and sometimes won't let her have water because she doesn't want her to pee while she's away. Like...you HAVE to give your animal access to water at all times...as a result I involuntarily take care of the dog a lot, whereas I really don't have the spare time or energy to do so.The thing is, she's a relatively young dog, a mix of 2 hyper breeds, and rescued from a super-abusive situation (i.e. her nervous system is skitzed out the wazoo). This dog is a never-ending ball of nervous, squealing energy and CONSTANTLY underfoot/whining - ZERO training. Walking into my home and experiencing a calm or peaceful atmosphere does not exist, ever. Cooking something in peace in the kitchen is not an experience I have in life. It is incessant and intense.Furthermore, she doesn't really exercise the dog, like ever. The dog spends several hours a day in a crate, several hours a day on the couch, and 20-40 minutes outside, attached to a fairly short (30 feet?) lead on a stake. Occasionally she'll take the dog with her when she visits a friend's house. This is fairly large, very hyper, traumatized dog who needs to be getting 3-5 hours of exercise PER DAY, at LEAST, and absolute tons of attention.I've brought this up to my roommate, and she just makes excuses. The landlord won't fence in the yard and she runs away. She's not good with other dogs, it's hard to take her to the dog park. I don't have time. Bla bla bla. I even took them both on a long walk and showed my roommate how to train her. By the end of the walk she was heeling for me. I stressed the importance of consistency. My roommate has never once taken her back out. Last night I suggested we go for a walk and I wound up taking the dog alone, because my roommate was \"tired from work,\" even though my day had been quite stressful and I too was tired af from work - but it a desperate attempt to get the dog even remotely exercised so I might have 5 minutes' peace. It was stressful and unwelcome, and I shouldn't have to be doing this to get a little sanity in my own home.I have EXTENSIVE lifelong experience with dogs, both personal and professional, and have trained many dogs much worse than hers. The thing is that this isn't my job, and I simply don't have the time or resources right now. I didn't sign up for this, and this is not my responsibility and not my commitment.Her dog's lack of both exercise and training is REALLY affecting my well-being. I am undergoing intense trauma therapies right now, and coming home to endless stress energy every day is not okay with me in the FIRST place, much less while I'm coping with this.I work with the dog where I can (she is eager to learn and please, so that's a plus), but like I said, I'm not available for the extreme commitment it takes to train and exercise a hyper, traumatized dog. Last night after I'd tried to say the same sentence to my roommate 16x and the communication still hadn't happened because the dog was whining so incessantly at my feet, I said to the dog, \"STOP!\" My roommate got defensive - \"She's just excited to see you.\" I said \"It's really hard for me to cope with how she literally NEVER stops.\" My roommate said \"Just walk past her.\" No.At one point a month ago my roommate was so stressed by vet bills she was considering giving the dog away, saying \"Maybe I'm just not ready to have a dog.\" I love the dog, but I could not possibly have hoped harder she would rehome her to someone with time and energy for her. But she didn't.I love my roommate and this is the most stable, healthy living situation I've ever had. I do NOT want to lose it or offend my roommate. I've dipped my toe into the conversation several times, and been totally shut down. I know people are generally highly defensive about their care of their pets. How do I bring up that the dog is NOT receiving adequate care whatsoever and it's completely unreasonable for her to expect me to just be cool with this? I need to be completely firm, but I don't want to cause a tsunami. I just want her to train and exercise her freaking dog so my life is not a constant nightmare of nervous, demanding, whiny, invasive energy. I am desperate for advice.I had to move out of my house in 2015 because of a roommate who WOULD NOT hear this same feedback.  She got crazy defensive and ran in the yard screaming at 3a.m. about how I think she's a \"terrible person\" and woke up all the neighbors.  She was much less mentally stable than my current roommate, but I'm still afraid. That dog (in 2015) was in a much worse situation - literally destroying all of our belongings constantly.

I kept in contact with him for a multitude of reasons. He was struggling at the time financially after leaving the army and graduating from school, he didn't have financial stability and was suicidal. Before the financial issue, if i did block him - he'd get a new number or email.     I had lost a lot in the span of 2 months that he did that to me, my job, my network of friends, my two siblings (my only source of family) had confessed that they resented me), and i had to up and move and start from scratch. There is more but i think this paints a vivid picture.  it's now approaching the 2 year mark of my rape. I struggled with my college studies post break-up, mainly because I lost who I was, what my life purpose is, and the value of love with/to others. I still cannot answer the question, why continue? it's all disappated in such a quick few months.  I have attempted 2 therapist over a a year and half. DBT group treatment. I took a break from school. I'll admit, the depression has a grasp on me (even after trying a variety of meds.)

I see no ill in such welfare. I agree with the court that such severely disabled persons are entitled to this assistance -- tactile interpretation or otherwise. However, as I've stated, I believe the state should supply it. I'm not sure how it'd work. Perhaps the disabled person and his people hire the tactile interpreter and the interpreter bills the state or state medicare, sort of like a doctor does, you get the idea. We have the right to go out and make money by providing goods, services, and experiences. If a company chooses to provide in-theater movies, then I believe it is reasonable for them to provide wheelchair access and subtitles for these things are not difficult to implement and the costs can be taken from their \"don't be a dick, get it done\" funds. Tactile interpreters on the other hand seem too rare in request and need to justify that we demand the theater have them 'on hand' at their expense (no pun intended). If a man chooses to open a hot dog cart he should not be required to (at his own expense) provide a wholly different product/accomodation for patrons who have lost all taste and olfactory sense. Should he be required to pay an employee to hang out near his hot dog cart with a white board for the rare, near never, occassion that such a disabled patron shows up looking for a bite? \"the steam hits ur upper lip\" *wipe* \"the aroma reminds you of the baseball game you went to with your cousins\" *wipe* \"the ketchup is sweet and provides a curious balance to the saltiness of the hotdog whose skin just popped releasing a tasty grease now lining your mouth\" *wipe* \"the bread has a bit of a doughy tang for my boss uses sourdough rolls instead of bland buns\" *wipe* \"the strange mix of aromas from these three ingredients mix in your upper nostril, making you question whether or not you should have gotten mustard to better balance the porky flavor, but you decide you like that this whole dietary experience is so similar to the ketchup dog your cousin gave you at the ballpark the day Barry Bonds' homerun ball popped you in the kisser disabling all of your olfactory and taste senses\" *wipe* \"your final bite is all bun, and this imperfect last bite filled with bready tang (instead of the salty, greasy meat flavor you sought when you paid $1.99) leaves you wondering 'should I get another just to leave that nice flavor lingering on my lips?'\" The answer to my question is: no. (As for the Whiteboard Taste Interpreter's question, I think his boss just makes him ask that at the end in order to help offset his employment costs.) The hot dog vendor should not have to hire that interpreter, for to do so invades his right to go out and provide a reasonable service like a damn hotdog or a damn movie.In this case it should be up to the disabled person and his people to coordinate the tactile interpreter whose costs should be billed to the state. If the theater had a link on their website or a phone number their employees could provide to the disabled person and his people then that's fine and to do so again falls in the \"get it done, don't be a dick\" category. But, the state should also be responsible for providing that information to the theater if they deem the theater responsible for providing it to the disabled patron.*weiner snap*             ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 44, "stickied": false, "score": -8, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  9 00:25:01 2017", "ups": -8}, {"body": "Ok but make them pay all the expenses for an interpreter.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 141176, "stickied": false, "score": 12, "submission_time": "Sun Oct  8 23:23:59 2017", "ups": 12}, {"body": "Tap tap.
