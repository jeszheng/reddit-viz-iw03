Positive acceleration will begin to speed up the car, which will also transfer some of its momentum into anything in contact with the car, like us.

During acceleration, a person sitting in their seat feels a lot of force, but a fly, only touching the air, not so much. The air in the car still accelerates, but air acts a bit differently than a solid mass. It ever so slightly compresses in the back of the car during positive acceleration and then slightly compresses in the front of the car during negative acceleration. The air absorbs and redistributes the force of acceleration much better than solid objects do, so the air inside the car really doesn't move much.

This is why we feel ourselves pushed into our seats when we speed up. When we stop accelerating though, everything in the car also stops accelerating as well, and everything remains at whatever velocity the vehicle has now reached. This is why we don't keep feeling that pressure of the car's acceleration; we've matched speeds. During acceleration, a person sitting in their seat feels a lot of force, but a fly, only touching the air, not so much. The air in the car still accelerates, but air acts a bit differently than a solid mass. It ever so slightly compresses in the back of the car during positive acceleration and then slightly compresses in the front of the car during negative acceleration. The air absorbs and redistributes the force of acceleration much better than solid objects do, so the air inside the car really doesn't move much. Likewise, the fly also moves very little due to airflow. The air resistance can rather quickly counter the force of inertia imposed on the fly.As the car accelerates, the air inside quickly attempts to re-normalize itself, so air resistance prevents the fly from simply splatting on the back window.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 384, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 00:47:00 2017", "ups": 1}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/76nw37/how_do_flies_keep_up_with_a_moving_vehicle_inside/", "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "There is often a tiny drop of mercury inside a fluorescent lightbulb to ensure there is a cloud of mercury vapor filling the tube so that when a voltage is applied across the gas, it gives off light - in the case of fluorescent bulbs, a glow heavy in ultraviolet light, which in turn induces fluorescence in the phosphorescent powder lining the interior, which is where the visible useful illumation actually comes from.Incidentally, mercury-filled glass tubes in all respects identical with normal fluorescent light bulbs but lacking the phosphor powder give off deadly UV radiation and are used as sanitizers for everything from high school lab goggles to air conditioning systems.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 69306, "stickied": false, "score": 7, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 16 05:26:45 2017", "ups": 7}, {"body": "As for disposal: if you have only a few, small bulbs (compact fluorescents), hardware stores will usually accept them for proper disposal.Four foot tubes are trickier: some will, some will not, even though they all should.For large industrial quantities, you must contract the services of a professional hazardous waste disposal company.

The session will take place after ESO's press conference on **16 October 2017 at 16:00 CEST (10 AM ET)**, which can be watched live at [www.eso.org/live](https://www.eso.org/public/live/).-----SummaryESO's fleet of telescopes in Chile have detected the first visible counterpart to a gravitational wave source. These historic observations suggest that this unique object is the result of the merger of two neutron stars. The cataclysmic aftermaths of this kind of merger \u2014 long-predicted events called kilonovae \u2014 disperse heavy elements such as gold and platinum throughout the Universe. This discovery, published in several papers in the journal Nature and elsewhere, also provides the strongest evidence yet that short-duration gamma-ray bursts are caused by mergers of neutron stars.Besides the science, the collaborative global effort to make this discovery possible was also very interesting. On 17 August 2017 a gravitational wave event was detected. About two seconds later, two space observatories detected a short gamma-ray burst from the same area of the sky. As night fell in Chile ESO's  telescopes as well as many others, peered at this patch of sky, pinpointing the source in visible and infrared light. Observations continued as night arrived in Hawaii, as well as for weeks after around the globe.Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1733/Guests:* Stephen Smartt, Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the Queen\u2019s University Belfast. He can take questions on the electromagnetic event, kilonova, r-process, chemical enrichment, heavy elements, telescopes and surveys, finding kilonovae.* Joe Lyman, Post-doctoral researcher at the University of Warwick. He can take questions on the host galaxy and environment of the kilonova, as well as the observations done at ESO\u2019s La Silla Observatory.* Marina Rejkuba, Associate Astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and head of ESO's User Support Department.

The amount of electrons it takes to fill each shell is 2, 8, 18, then it gets a bit messy. Thus, it takes those jumps in atomic number to get back to the same valency.For example, flourine has atomic number 9, with valency 1.

Electrons tend to group up until they fill a \"shell\" and then start a new shell. Chemical properties arise from the number of electrons in the outer shell and the mass of the nucleus.Looking at the periodic table, the elements to the far left all have one electron orbiting further out, and zero or more full shells further in. This outer electron is fairly easy to rip off, giving these elements similar chemical properties, which is why we label them as being in the same group.On top of the very basic explanation above, it should be noted that full shells are more stable, and the physical world likes stability, so atoms can share electrons in various ways leading to almost full shells getting filled and almost empty shells getting emptied. This is how we get chemistry in the first place.In terms of mathematical formula: yes! Not atomic weight but total number of protons and neutrons (which also gives you total number of electrons). It's a quantum mechanical formula, and the exact solution becomes exponential ly more complicated as the atoms gets larger, to the extent that we can only really use it for hydrogen.

And while I think that is valuable, I really just right now need to hear from the people who already share my frustration with patriarchy and who are already feminists. How do you cope?Here's my question/anecdote/rant. Sorry in advance that it's stupid, but I just hit a weird breaking point over something minor, and I'm really thinking to myself, how do I get on??I just don't know how to take it anymore. This is stupid, but I just got back from seeing Blade Runner with my boyfriend and another couple. I don't care to talk about the movie right now, but it's full of really misogynistic scenes- literally every scene that includes a woman character. I kept trying to ignore it and get into the film, but the misogyny just kept pulling me out of it, and it's so long. By the end I was just so ready for it to be over so we could get on with our lives.As soon as the film was over, the other woman said something that made me realize she felt the same way I did so we laughed and ranted a bit about what a misogynistic film it was. Our two partners agreed with us, but they said mostly it didn't bother them and they were able to enjoy the film. We dropped it at that.Later at home and after a few drinks, I started to think about it again, and I asked my bf how he could've enjoyed the film or not noticed all the things I noticed. He said he noticed some of them but was mostly wrapped up in the film and not interested in analyzing it from a feminist point of view. I said I wasn't either (I seriously wasnt) but that the movie kept pulling me out of it by showing something awful and misogynistic every single scene so I couldn't just relax and stop thinking about it. He said he didn't feel this way and couldn't relate. Because my partner is black, I tried to personalize it. I said, what if every single scene that involved a black character, they were playing around with some terrible racist stereotype like wearing black face and eating watermelon- something just blatant and bigoted like that. Would he have been able to just ignore that or not notice and instead enjoy the film? He says no, he hadn't thought of it that way. But the point is of course that he didn't.This is a really minor thing, and who cares right? But I'm having trouble shaking how depressed it's gotten me. And it's not about a stupid movie night. All the shit that is going on right now- the fight for coverage of birth control like any other drug, the fight for abortion access, the politicians lately who've said men shouldn't have to contribute to insurance coverage for prenatal care, the high maternal mortality rate among women of color, the current detention of pregnant immigrants and prevention of some of them to receive health care, the expiration of CHIP, assholes misogynists like our current president and administration, the Weinstein shit, cases like that Brock Turner asshole, it's like it just never stops. And then when I'm out and about in real life with decent men that I care about who are feminists, they don't even notice that a movie that revolves around sex bot housewife servants and defining human by the ability to reproduce and several scenes in which they slice open uteruses and discuss violent death in childbirth, they aren't even troubled enough to notice that it's really disturbing and misogynistic?I feel like it's the straw that breaks the camel's back- it's not a serious thing.

They shut the store down, but they couldn't find him. I made a police report. The policeman asked me a lot of questions about the penis. I didn't know how to answer because I had never seen one before.Later that year, a man touched my ass in the mayonnaise aisle at the grocery store.

An older Belgian man offered to let me stand in front of him, at the front of the crowd. He then put his hands on my vagina. I froze, not knowing what to do. As I looked around for help, my eyes found Nathan, another boy on my trip. He was laughing. I just stayed where I was. When we left the crowd, I was pulled aside by the adult chaperones.

I don't greet people with handshakes or hugs, and dislike it when the person I'm speaking with initiates such contact. Talking to people is absolutely draining. I have no friends because it is simply too exhausting. I have no motive to continue building a friendship or relationship of any kind.

I don't enjoy the presence of another person in any way, shape or form and only tolerate it when there is something to distract me from it.  I do however form bonds of a type and, while I am not comfortable talking with or touching another person, I notice their absence and miss them for a very short period of time.

I'm a country girl from a small town in Northern California, so this is my first time living in a big city.  I've owned pepper spray and a taser since I moved out of my parents house when I turned 18, but have never had to use them.So...I was at my local liquor store buying a 6 pack of beer after work.  There's a very mentally ill homeless guy in our neighborhood, but he knows me and my ex.  We have 2 adorable rescue dogs that we walk 3 times a day, and we also give out food to the homeless people in the neighborhood.  Water bottles and granola bars on hot days, homemade soup and hot chocolate on cold days.  This guy knows me.  He's just, off his meds or not getting them at all.Anyway, I'm standing in line holding my 6 pack of beer, and he comes into the store and starts screaming.  \"Lady.  Girl.  Woman.  I don't like you\".  I look around and realize I'm the only woman in the store.  Start getting scared.  He walked up to me, pointed his finger in my face (that really pisses me off, BTW) and keeps screaming.  \"You're evil.  You're a bitch.  You're a demon.  You need to go back to hell where you belong\".  Then, out of the blue, he leaned back and slapped me across the face as hard as he could.  I'm not used to getting hit, so ouch.I dropped the beer, which instantly exploded and started spraying around everywhere.  The guys that work there are behind a bulletproof glass window, so they were frantically trying to come help me.  There were 2 other men in the back of the store that started running towards me.  But it all happened so quickly.   The guy pulled his arm back with his fist cocked like he was going to punch me in the face.  I didn't even think....I pulled my taser out of my purse and hit him with it.  He collapsed, and I burst into tears.  The guys in the store called 911 and I was in hysterics at that point.

It's 40%.  This is the highest rate in the world.Estate taxes do break up farms.  I know plenty of families who have gone through this, but now-a-days most farms get around the estate tax with a trust.  It's not a big problem, but it's not a lie.  It's not a valid reason for keeping the estate tax, but again, it is true.Double taxing LLCs and C-Corps is a real thing, too.  Yes, it includes Doctors and other professionals, but it also hit your local landscaper or any other licensed professional.  We may should keep it in place, but Krugman is dishonest in suggesting that it isn't double taxing.Then he goes and says that Apple, Google, and Microsoft don't have a return on physical capital.  Well that's just absurd.  All three are between 5-10% ROA.  Slightly higher than a typical retailer like Macy's or Walmart.Repatriating will create some jobs, but that's not the point of repatriation.  It's to get the tax revenues.  This is just a big strawman.  Krugman was pro-repatriation before Trump won.Also, there is a tax cut for the rich, but not ONLY the rich.  Of course the numbers will show the higher income earners gain more from the tax cut...they make more fucking money.    This is obvious.The argument should be that they don't NEED a tax cut, not that they are the only ones getting it.  Of course 80% of the tax cut will go to the people making 80% of the money all things equal.  That's not an argument.The reason middle class people want the tax cuts is because their 3-4% increase in take home pay is real and substantial to them.  If Trump just kept the top bracket where it is, this was be a really good thing for the US.  That's how Krugman should be writing.

(Yeah! /r/socialism!)This causes the top 1% to have an effective tax rate 7x higher than the bottom 50%.https://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-0/This isn't to say that the GOP aren't lying cows. I'm just pointing out that the rich do pay a lot in taxes, but we do not have the social programs (and costs) that Europe has, and we subsidize European social programs with our European military presence.Cutting American military spending by eliminating foreign military presence was one of the many things Trump promised during the election...

Saying things like \u201cwhat do they expect him to do?\u201d or it\u2019s impossible to fix Puerto Rico and provide for them quickly seeing as they are on an island.Well here\u2019s the thing people. Houston Texas was devastated right? So was Florida. Houston is home to about 2.5 million people.  New Orleans had what 1 million or so? How were those disasters handled? How many people were displaced in Florida how many lost everything? These places got help. Even in New Orleans with the terrible response big things were done when it became the disaster that it became. New Orleans is STILL recovering from the devastation. Many people just left the city after losing everything. However, in all of these cases the military and fema mobilized to provide the essentials. Drinking water and evacuation of necessary. What do people expect from Trump? Leadership. A leader would identify the problem weigh the potential solutions and act. Do whatever it took to save people. Get people off the island, get shelters in place, get people the water they need. Basically do what they did for every other American city that has been affected by a disaster. This isn\u2019t about rebuilding the island it\u2019s about getting people in danger out or provide what they need.The federal government is funded for just such occasions. If money is an issue then he goes to congress and gets emergency funding. It\u2019s his responsibility to also be as frugal as possible in spending taxpayers hard earned money. This storm was not a surprise. When the warning that Texas was going to be hot hard provisions were staged and plans were in place to respond effectively. Same in Florida. The main highways leading to Florida were shut down and made to go only in one direction. Helicopters from the navy, the floating hospital that belongs to the government, aircraft carriers. Military equipment designed to get around areas with no or little infrastructure could have been in place ahead of time. If there weren\u2019t enough people to handle the job then you pull people in from other departments to assist. Anyone within government with the skills to help. ALL OF THIS is within the power of the president to do. So what has he done to help? Apart from declaring Puerto Rico a disaster zone he has disparaged the Island and it\u2019s inhabitants. Instead of encouraging them and showing personal interest in them he did the bare minimum. He was on the Island for a mere 3 hours. While people were without power he played golf. Understandably trump can the there on the ground fixing power lines but at the very least he and his administration should be giving an effective play by play so people in Puerto Rico and in the US know where we are and how we can help. He hasn\u2019t done so. Instead he has complained and insulted the people who were begging for help and accusing them of complaining for political gain. Saying a good or \u201ctremendous\u201d job is being done doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s actually happening.Are 3 simultaneous disasters a huge problem? Yes. But even with that this presidents actions have been minimal. The fact is, he is there when it\u2019s for good publicity and gone when things go wrong. He isn\u2019t addressing the situation he isn\u2019t explaining anything he simply says we are doing a great job. There is no doubt that the people at fema and the aid groups are doing what they can. The sense of urgency that existed for Texas and Florida simply isn\u2019t there. And that starts from the top. In short what do people expect from trump? To be the freaking president. And if he isn\u2019t prepared to do it then get out of the way for someone better.
