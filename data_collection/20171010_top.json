[{"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "The myth that Titanic was in any way badly designed, badly built, or badly operated by the standards of the time. In fact there are so many ridiculous inaccuracies surrounding Titanic that it's hard to list even a fraction of them here...* She was an incredibly seaworthy ship - much more so than any passenger ship around today. The iceberg tore a gash almost a third of the way down her side, and she still stayed afloat for more than two hours!* In that time, all but two of her lifeboats were launched - there wasn't time to launch any more. She could have had a hundred more lifeboats on board, but that wouldn't have helped without vastly more crew to operate them.* Titanic's passengers genuinely did believe that she was practically unsinkable. When the time came to begin loading the lifeboats, many thought they would be safer staying on Titanic. There wasn't time for the crew to wait around convincing more people to get in, so when a lifeboat was ready, if there was no-one else waiting to get in, it had to go. This is why so many of Titanic's lifeboats left only half-full - the crew weren't worried about over-filling them.* Titanic wasn't travelling too fast for the conditions - by the standards of practice around at the time. Further precautions were put into practice after the incident, but no-one on board can be blamed for doing what anyone on any ship would have done the same.* Titanic was by no means a fast ship - nor was she ever intended to be. The White Star Line (Titanic's owners) were in competition with one other big shipping line, Cunard. Cunard's liners (Mauretania, Lusitania and later Aquatania) were the fastest in the business. To combat this, instead of fighting for speed, White Star decided to try to make their liners the most luxurious in the world. Olympic and Titanic were famed for their splendour and comfort - passengers said that it was easy to forget that you were at sea, as there were very few vibrations from the engines, and the ships remained stable even in fairly rough seas. By comparison, Cunard's liners were very fast, but their quadruple-screw configuration made vibration more apparent. It's a myth that Titanic was ever trying to make record-breaking speed across the Atlantic.* She wasn't built using sub-standard materials. This rumour goes around a lot these days because of an article that was written some time ago - what the article is supposed to mean is that there is much better quality steel available today. This was not the case in 1909. Additionally, Titanic's builders were paid on a fee plus materials basis - they were given a set fee to construct the ship, plus the cost of *all* materials used. There was no incentive to use anything but the best steel they could get their hands on. The shipyard had an excellent reputation and would not risk tainting it by using bad steel, which could easily be noticed on inspection anyway.* Titanic and her two sister ships Olympic and Britannic were also surprisingly manoeuvrable for their size - much more so than was expected. Some will tell you that Titanic's rudder was too small, but this simply isn't true. In fact, Olympic's wartime captain marvelled at her manoeuvrability, and was even able to throw her into a sudden turn, ramming (and sinking) a German U-boat. Olympic was the only merchant vessel throughout the First World War recorded to have sunk an enemy vessel.* While it's true that the lookouts' binoculars were misplaced (or rather, locked away in a cabinet that no-one on board had the key to open), this made no difference to Titanic's fate. The images of sea captains and pirates scanning the horizon through telescopes, while common in films, has virtually no stead in reality. Binoculars and telescopes narrow your field of vision down to a fine point, making it harder to spot anything. Lookouts on real ships will use their eyes alone to search for objects of interest, and once they've been spotted, will use a set of binoculars to further inspect it. Titanic's lookouts would not have been using their binoculars to search for iceberg even if they'd had them.* Third class passengers were never trapped below decks - the big metal gates you might remember from the film never even existed. The only time passengers were kept below decks was near the beginning of the disaster, when the officers needed time to prepare the lifeboats. First and second class passengers were allowed on deck, but as there were so many more third-class passengers the crowd was asked to stay below for a short while, until the officers were ready to start loading lifeboats. No-one was ever locked up. In fact a higher percentage of third-class males survived the sinking than second-class males.* Titanic was the largest ship in the world, but not by much - her older sister Olympic was identical in almost every way. A few changes to Titanic's layout (including the covering up of some promenade decks, making them count as interior space) made her technically larger, but both ships were exactly the same length, breadth and height. Olympic had a GRT (gross registered tonnage) of 45,324 gross register tons. Titanic's GRT was some 1,000 tons greater. After the disaster, Olympic received a refit, after which her GRT was up to about 30 more than Titanic's had been. But Titanic's younger sister, Britannic, which was launched after the disaster and had been modified during construction as a result of it, was about 2 feet wider than her sisters and had a GRT more than 2,000 tons greater than Titanic's.* White Star Line's owner, Bruce Ismay, likely had nothing to do with the incident. Another myth popularised by the film is that Ismay had convinced Captain Smith to sail faster and try to get to New York in record time. He's also portrayed as a bumbling idiot, and sneaks onto a lifeboat when the officers aren't looking. While we'll never know whether or not Ismay really did discuss Titanic's schedule with Smith, it's incredibly unlikely - Smith was looking to retire after commanding Titanic, had an extremely good reputation, and was a much-loved public figure. Passengers scrambled to sail on a ship under his command. He is unlikely to have been swayed to make rash decisions based on Ismay's need for Titanic to make headlines. Ismay himself played an active role during the sinking, helping passengers into lifeboats and doing what he could where possible (one officer recalled telling him to get out of the way as he was making a nuisance of himself by getting involved, but testified that he was trying to help). Ismay stepped into an empty spot on  one of the last boats to leave the ship, just as it was preparing to lower. He didn't take anyone else's space. Unfortunately the media needed a scapegoat, and he was the highest-ranking official to survive the disaster. He adopted a secluded lifestyle after the disaster, funding several naval charities but otherwise staying out of the public eye.* Higher watertight compartments or compartments sealed at the top would not have saved the ship - Most people could tell you that Titanic sunk because the weight of the water in the foremost watertight compartments pulled the bow down, allowing the water to spill over the top into more compartments, and so-on throughout the ship. But had Titanic's watertight bulkhead walls run all the way to the top deck, she might actually have sunk faster - with so much water contained in the front third of the vessel, she would have begun to tilt forwards much earlier, and possibly have broken in two sooner than she did. Sealing the tops of the bulkheads to prevent water from spilling over is actually illegal, and still is today. The International SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea) Regulations state that no civil (non-military) vessel can have any obstruction above watertight compartments that could impede a passenger's escape. The bottom line is that Titanic was damaged beyond her specifications, and was doomed from the moment she hit the iceberg.* \"Full Astern\" - There's a belief (popularised by the film) that Titanic's engines were thrown full astern on sighting the iceberg, and that this may have hindered her ability to turn away from it. This rumour started because of evidence given by the fourth officer, who who wasn't even on the bridge at the time of the collision. The only survivor who was present was the quartermaster, but from his position in the wheelhouse he couldn't see the commands sent to the engine room on the bridge telegraphs. Survivors from the engine room and the boiler rooms attested that the command was \"stop\" rather than \"astern\". Whoever you choose to believe, when you think about the timescale it really makes very little difference. There was less than 40 seconds between the iceberg sighting and the collision - and in that time, the lookouts had to ring the bell, pick up the phone, wait for 6th officer Moody to enter the wheelhouse and answer it, and alert him to the iceberg; then, Moody relayed that order to the most senior officer on the bridge (1st Officer Murdoch); Murdoch ordered the turn to port, then crossed to the telegraph to send the order to stop. Try acting that out in real time, and work out how long the engineers had to act on the \"stop\" order - not long enough. There's a really good article explaining exactly what went on in the engine rooms [here]( http://www.uco.es/~ff1mumuj/titanic1.htm); this goes into a lot more detail than I can, and comes to the same conclusions. Long story short - there wasn't even enough time to stop the engines, let alone put them in reverse. Slowing down or keeping full-ahead would have had no difference, as the turning circle stays the same. Leaving the starboard engine running may have turned Titanic's bow away from the iceberg, but it would have made it more difficult to keep the stern away.

The blood travels through arteries in the heart just like most other places in the body.A heart attack is when one or more of those arteries are blocked and the heart tissue starts to die from starvation. If enough cells die, the entire organ dies. A cardiac arrest is when the entire heart fails to pump normally. Resulting in that blood flow stopping throughout the entire body. Not just the heart. There are several causes of cardiac arrest. One of them being a major heart attack that kills enough of the heart muscle. But you can have a cardiac arrest from having a multitude of medical problems. From a burst blood vessel in your brain to a blocked blood vessel in your lungs and even losing enough blood or having a huge systemic infection. These are the people who need CPR.

Like e a LOT. I'm talking 6 hours of letting the busses go everyday because we were having endless conversations .Than one day I kissed her told her I wanted to be with her, she says she has to think about it over the weekend. Fine, okay, fuck I can't wait til Monday, FUUCK.Okay, it's Monday we talk we make out we are together but only in secret.Then my best friend says she thinks the girl likes him, I tell him with the smuggest smile on my face that that's impossible because we are going out.So now my friend knows so we have to make it official because he will tell it to everyone, I know him.But first we have to tell my girlfriends friend who the whole school knows is into me, but I find her weird as hell. Who should tell her?Of course, me.I get off the bus at her stop and have the most awkward conversation in my life. Like sorry you're into me but this dog already has a collar.Fast forward 9 months girl and I broke up I was miserable with her and more so without her.One day go home with her friend who is obvious still into me but doesn't show it at all when we're together, it's like she has a completely different persona in public, she acts though and stingy. I find that very interesting.We hang out often as we have the same friend group and one time her girlfriend leaves because it's getting late, so it's only the two of us. She says she has to go home as well.As she gets up I grab her hand.OH fuck, brain what are you doing?!Hold her hand all the way to her house. Have awkward as hell first kiss with a dog walking between us and tangling us with rope. Go out to iceskate, decide we are boyfriend and girlfriend.Still weird as fuck and have a lot of problems for some years, but work through it.Turns out she and I are not a dream couple but both of us are trying.Also turns out my ex is a bitch and probably was with me only for the attention and acts all sad about the breakup just to get more attention as she's realized no one cares about her anymore. Keep dealing with all kinds of shit going to a psychologist and having a painful appoint almost every week with my dentist and trying to see my new girlfriend as much as I can. Turns out she is the most loving person I know and has been there for me for a long year of depression when I just cried and cried and cried.We are in university now in second year (she's in international business and I'm in electrical engineering) and barely see each other (one of the constant problems of our relationship) but we are working through it and support each other in every way we can.I want to marry this girl really badly as I love her more than anything in the world.So for me the moral of the story is: love is 40% compatible people being together and 60% honesty and work on the relationship from both of them.  Not at all what I imagined love to be. Edit: oh and turns out girl #1 mostly likely did have a crush on my friend as she was quite shallow and he is a textbook Chad.

My first exposure to this idea was in Counter-Strike 1.6, but I didn't really appreciate it until I made my own levels in Halo 3.  Since then, I've always wanted a multi-tiered game that appealed to several kinds of fans.In essence, the game would rely on certain players to create maps and tweak everything from in-game physics to custom weapons/gear, while other players would play these levels and complete their respective objectives, whatever they may be.  I always envisioned separate categories for campaign-creation (basically levels intended for immersive solo or co-op play), goal-oriented \"missions\" where players are required to complete a specific action in order to win, and another for just a raw PvP mode where players duke it out on custom levels in teams or FFA.  In the end, this game would have the potential to create environments and gameplay as disparate as Skyrim and Crackdown (though maybe not quite as complex as the former).Obviously this game would require a lot of time and energy to make, mostly to find a middle ground between the depth and ease of in-game creation.  There's probably something close (or indentical) to it already that I'm unaware of, but if there isn't, I'd love for this to become a reality.  I realize that engines like Unreal enable users to basically create their own games, but to see this idea implemented more simply and under a common banner would, in my opinion, create a more focused community that encouraged even novice users to create or explore wildly different situations.A man can dream.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4832, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 16:01:54 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Left 4 Dead 3", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5453, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 18:45:09 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "A multiplayer Witcher 3", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 148, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 15:14:30 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "Virtual reality gta5And I mean like real interactive gameplay like running and stuff", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4937, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 15:34:00 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "An open world game where the main character is a dumb blonde valley girl.

I had a client who was a licensed caregiver/provider, and was looking to open a dispensary with a partner.  My client found a location for the business, but before they leased it, the partner insisted on signing an agreement that my client would not be an owner, merely an employee with an option to buy-in a few years down the road.  This wasn't at all what they had discussed, so it fell apart and they opened separate businesses.The prospective partner sued my client in County X for breach of contract, claiming that my client had essentially reneged on their deal and hijacked the business premises.  This was not true - the \"partner\" was a nasty piece of work and simply trying to muscle my client out of the market.  Pretty sure the other side thought that even if they lost, they could drag the case out long enough to strangle my client with legal fees.Interestingly, even though their shops were quite close and both had the same township mailing address, the partner's shop was in County X, and my client's was just on the other side of the jurisdiction line in County Y.I thought about litigation strategy a while, did some research, and had a talk with my client about a potentially risky strategy.  My client wanted to go for it.We promptly moved to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that marijuana distribution is still illegal under federal law, and the courts of our state won't offer any remedy for breach of a contract with illegal subject matter. This was a dicey strategy because if it won, it would set a precedent - at least in that county - that would make it hard for my client to ever bring a breach of contract lawsuit there, should the need arise.  But he figured since his shop was actually in County Y, it was unlikely he'd ever be forced to use the County X court.We had our arguments in court, and the plaintiff \"partner\" was...upset with this approach.  But the judge *agreed* with us, and the case was dismissed.  Because I'd made an offer of judgment for like $500 before bringing the motion, this meant my client also got a better result than his judgment offer (which was of course rejected), so the court also ordered the \"partner\" to pay all of my client's legal fees.So the \"partner\" decides to appeal, as expected.  I then talked to his lawyer and discussed how, if we won on appeal, it could set a *state-wide* precedent that no dispensary owner could bring any lawsuits related to the business, and his client might find operating any sort of dispensary business difficult afterwards.  We were essentially playing chicken with the entire medical marijuana industry.  So, as we had planned, we offered to waive the award of attorney fees if they'd drop the appeal before we had to spend time briefing it.A few days later, the appeal was dismissed....and the other side continued operating in County X, where it's basically impossible for them to bring any contract lawsuits, if they get ripped off/not paid/improperly evicted/etc, because of \"illegal subject matter.\"  ....and my client continued operating in County Y.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 35845, "stickied": false, "score": 220, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 22:44:21 2017", "ups": 220}, {"body": "Husbands email password was ex-girlfriends name & their anniversary date ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 552, "stickied": false, "score": 173, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 20:57:19 2017", "ups": 173}, {"body": "One time I got jumped and one of the guys pulled a gun on me.

The modern concept of a sandwich using slices of bread as found within the West can arguably be traced to 18th century Europe. However, the use of some kind of bread or bread-like substance to lie under (or under and over) some other food, or used to scoop up and enclose or wrap some other type of food, long predates the eighteenth century, and is found in numerous much older cultures worldwide.    The ancient Jewish sage Hillel the Elder is said to have wrapped meat from the Paschal lamb and bitter herbs between two pieces of old-fashioned soft matzah\u2014flat, unleavened bread\u2014during Passover in the manner of a modern wrap made with flatbread. Flat breads of only slightly varying kinds have long been used to scoop or wrap small amounts of food en route from platter to mouth throughout Western Asia and northern Africa. From Morocco to Ethiopia to India, bread is baked in flat rounds, contrasting with the European loaf tradition.    During the Middle Ages in Europe, thick slabs of coarse and usually stale bread, called \"trenchers\", were used as plates. After a meal, the food-soaked trencher was fed to a dog or to beggars at the tables of the wealthy, and eaten by diners in more modest circumstances. The immediate culinary precursor with a direct connection to the English sandwich was to be found in the Netherlands of the seventeenth century, where the naturalist John Ray observed that in the taverns beef hung from the rafters \"which they cut into thin slices and eat with bread and butter laying the slices upon the butter\"\u2014 explanatory specifications that reveal the Dutch belegde broodje, open-faced sandwich, was as yet unfamiliar in England.    Initially perceived as food that men shared while gaming and drinking at night, the sandwich slowly began appearing in polite society as a late-night meal among the aristocracy. The sandwich's popularity in Spain and England increased dramatically during the nineteenth century, when the rise of industrial society and the working classes made fast, portable, and inexpensive meals essential. In London, for example, at least seventy street vendors were selling ham sandwiches by 1850; during that decade sandwich bars also became an important form of eating establishment in western Holland, typically serving liver and salt beef sandwiches.    At the same time that the European-style sandwich finally began to appear outside of Europe. In the United States, the sandwich was first promoted as an elaborate meal at supper.

Those molecules are taken up by internal organs as part of normal metabolic activity. Over time the radioisotopes attached to the molecules are constantly decaying, and in this case they are emitting positrons. When the positron is emitted it combines with a nearby electron and emits two gamma rays of very characteristic energies. Some, but certainly not all, of these gamma rays are detected by sensors in a ring placed around the body which have the ability to detect the direction of the gamma rays as well. The whole body is scanned using these detectors which then produce a map of the gamma ray flux out of the body in sort of a cylindrical shape. The data in that map is then crunched by a computer which uses it to recreate what the internal 3D shape of different concentrations of the radioistope (and thus the radioisotope tagged molecule) was in the body. This makes it possible to probe metabolic activity in the body, which is extremely useful especially in the study of cancer.NMR/MRI works entirely differently. NMR works by subjecting your body to a strong magnetic field, which causes a slight excess of magnetically active nuclei (like Hydrogen) to align with the field. When those nuclei are then subjected to a low energy burst of radio waves in a very specific narrow band of wavelengths some of the aligned nuclei will flip to be anti-aligned, in an excited state. This only happens when the energy of the radio waves is exactly equal to the difference in energy levels between those two alignment states, which is different for different types of atoms (e.g. Hydrogen-1 vs. Carbon-13). Afterward, the nuclei relax back to their normal state, which is again an excess of nuclei aligned with the magnetic field, the result is that some nuclei that were in the excited state will flip to the relaxed state, emitting energy in the form of a radio wave photon while doing so.Most importantly, the energy needed to excite the nucleus and the energy released by the nucleus as it is relaxing is dependent on the precise effective *local* magnetic field. And that will be subtly different depending on the presence of electrons around the nucleus, which can help to shield some small part of the magnetic field due to electromagnetic effects. And what that means is that the precise energy of radio waves applicable to a Hydrogen nucleus sharing two electrons in a molecular bond with another atom will depend on the \"electronegativity\" of the atom attached to that Hydrogen atom, and the rest of the molecule as well. Through some other complicated effects this means that you can get very characteristic spectral data for a molecule just by looking at the radio waves emitted during this relaxation (importantly, the range of radio wave energies is very small so it's easy to hit the nuclei with a burst that covers all of the wavelengths needed to excite them into the aligned state).

This technique is used all the time by chemists to identify different chemicals.Things are a bit more complicated when you are talking about bulk samples of materials that have lots of different component molecules. Overall you can use NMR spectra on bulk samples to get a sense of things like the overall water content, and see characteristic differences between different kinds of mixtures (e.g. one that was mostly lipids would look different from one that was mostly water from one that had a high concentration of glucose from one that was mostly muscle tissue, etc.) An MRI is a sequence of NMR spectra that is scanned over the entire body in three dimensions (this is possible because the magnetic field can be controlled such that only a tiny volume will be \"active\" for the relevant frequencies of radio waves used and detected). The amount of information in such a scan can be truly enormous, depending on the spectral and spatial resolution. Various filters are applied to categories different spectral data for different parts of the body as belonging to different tissue types (e.g. fat, muscle, lung, brain, bone, etc, etc, etc.) This makes it possible to see the internal structure of the body, and often to identify abnormalities.

PET scans work by making a molecular tracer radioactive. The tracer works its way through your body and it will start to build up in areas that are problematic in the body (I don't the biology well). So as this tracer decays and releases positrons, those positrons are immediately annihilated with nearby electrons thus two photons are released in perfectly opposite directions.

Those molecules are taken up by internal organs as part of normal metabolic activity. Over time the radioisotopes attached to the molecules are constantly decaying, and in this case they are emitting positrons. When the positron is emitted it combines with a nearby electron and emits two gamma rays of very characteristic energies. Some, but certainly not all, of these gamma rays are detected by sensors in a ring placed around the body which have the ability to detect the direction of the gamma rays as well. The whole body is scanned using these detectors which then produce a map of the gamma ray flux out of the body in sort of a cylindrical shape. The data in that map is then crunched by a computer which uses it to recreate what the internal 3D shape of different concentrations of the radioistope (and thus the radioisotope tagged molecule) was in the body. This makes it possible to probe metabolic activity in the body, which is extremely useful especially in the study of cancer.NMR/MRI works entirely differently.

Consider for instance the reaction of moving an electron from a sodium atom to a chlorine atom: Na + Cl --> Na^+ + Cl^- . From what most of us learned in grade school that the right-hand side of that equation has filled shells, so it is more stable. It is not. Two _isolated ions_ by themselves in a vacuum are not stable compared to the neutral atoms. (The ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJ/mol and the electron affinity of chlorine is -349 kJ/mol, so you're short 150 kJ/mol). It's _in water solution_ that the two ions are stable, thanks to the additional stabilizing interaction with the water molecules. As a rule, the neutral form of a pair of atoms/molecules is almost always more stable than an oxidized/reduced pair, even if they get to have filled shells. It's only when you form an ionic bond or a introduce a stabilizing solute that ions become stable. So there are a lot of competing effects here. Just from a Coulomb's Law guesstimate, it clearly should require twice as much energy to remove a second electron from a positively-charged ion, three times as much to remove the third. (This assumes the electrons have the same energy other than the potential charge from the nucleus) Now look at the first three ionization energies for the [nitrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen). They're 1402, 2856, 4578 kJ/mol. So this shows that it actually follows that trend, roughly. But only that far - the fourth ionization energy is 7475. This goes for them all, for instance Magnesium: 738, 1451, 7733 kJ/mol. As soon as you start pulling electrons out of a lower shell, there's a dramatic jump in the amount of energy required. Which is to be expected, since those electrons have a different amount of energy entirely. It works the same way for the electron affinity. If acquiring another electron requires moving it into a higher shell, the affinity (amount of energy en electron loses by being added to the atom, relative a free electron) will be significantly lower.Now, you're not wrong in pointing out that the electronic repulsion increases. It does. However, you're overestimating its effects. Consider Helium for instance. The ground-state electron energy of a [hydrogen-like atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-like_atom), in Hartree units, is -Z^(2)/2. Which means the H ground state is -1/2 Hartrees, and the He^+ ground state is 2^(2)/2 = -2 Hartrees. Now introduce a second electron that _doesn't repel the first one at all_ and the ground state energy for your two non-interacting electrons is simply twice that, or -4 Hartrees. The [actual ground state](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0605018) energy is -2.903... So the electron-electron repulsion is indeed quite significant, increasing the ground-state energy by 27% compared to fictional noninteracting electrons.However, this is once again making the 'mistake' of looking at the absolute numbers and the energies as compared to a free electron.  Again in these 'stability' discussions you're interested in the _relative_ quantities, so the amount of e-e repulsion you're interested in is really the relative amount of repulsion in the orbital an electron is leaving relative the orbital the it's entering. Now when you consider electrons in different orbitals in the same subshell (px vs py vs pz for instance), then those orbitals don't actually overlap that much more than any other ones. And all else being equal, electrons should and do ( per [Hund's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hund%27s_rule_of_maximum_multiplicity)) first spread out evenly to minimize e-e repulsion^*. Filling a complete shell or half-shell, however, gives spherical symmetry and increases the effective nuclear charge per electron (Uns\u00f6ld's Theorem), lowering the energy and making filled (and half-filled) shells particularly stable. You can see these things compete in the copper-silver-gold group of metals, where one of the formerly lower-lying s-orbital electrons is promoted up to fill the d-shell, because the gain of closing the d shell is relatively great while the electron repulsion is relatively high in the s shell.So in short, there are many competing things going on and it's, to say the least, rather complicated to explain. (\\* Wikipedia and Levine's book claim that Hund's rule isn't because of e-e repulsion and was only formerly believed to be so.

Filling a complete shell or half-shell, however, gives spherical symmetry and increases the effective nuclear charge per electron (Uns\u00f6ld's Theorem), lowering the energy and making filled (and half-filled) shells particularly stable. You can see these things compete in the copper-silver-gold group of metals, where one of the formerly lower-lying s-orbital electrons is promoted up to fill the d-shell, because the gain of closing the d shell is relatively great while the electron repulsion is relatively high in the s shell.So in short, there are many competing things going on and it's, to say the least, rather complicated to explain. (\\* Wikipedia and Levine's book claim that Hund's rule isn't because of e-e repulsion and was only formerly believed to be so. It was a few years ago but I've read the actual research articles on that though and have a different view, namely that both explanations are valid, as they're made within different approximations/models that account for the energy in literally different terms)", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 96944, "stickied": false, "score": 8, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 02:00:12 2017", "ups": 8}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/75id9g/whyhow_does_having_full_electron_orbitals_make_an/", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "It's really just a matter of definition.

However, in the last several decades, fires have become more frequent and intense, largely due to side effects from trying to suppress fires and many other changes due to anthropogenic modification of the landscape / vegetation etc, but this is again superimposed on a longer term deficit so in some ways we're starting to catch up with how much should have burned in the last ~100 years.**Longer Answer:** [There is an interesting paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/9/E535.full) that assembles a proxy record of fire occurrence and severity for the last 3000 years in the western US which allows us to partially place modern times in context. One of the takeaways is that prior to around 1800 (calendar years) fire frequency, intensity, amount of biomass burned, etc all kind of oscillated with the climate so during hotter drier/drought periods, fire metrics generally went up, and then during cooler wetter periods, fire metrics generally went down. As intense colonization by western European settlers began in the 1800s, fire statistics started to decouple from climate. This was because of a myriad of changes that are described in that paper, but things like clearing of trees for timber and agriculture, change in vegetation through introduction of new grazing animals (cows, etc), producing fire breaks through infrastructure (building cities, railroads, etc), and in more modern times dedicated fire suppression efforts. What this has all generally led to is actually a huge deficit in the amount of biomass one would predict should be burned (especially as much of the west is in a long term drier and hotter period, where fires should generally increase). The key image in that paper is figure 2, panel C. The red and grey lines are different smoothed lined of the actual fire record showing a decline in biomass burned, where as the thick black line is showing predicted biomass (based on the climate record) burning. You can see that they mirror each other until ~1850 where actual biomass burned declines but predicted biomass burned sky rockets (you can see in graphs below, mean annual temp and drought area have gone up suggesting there should be a lot more fires than there are).Now, all of the above is a long term view and shows that generally speaking compared to the natural fire cycle, in most ways that we can measure, the western US is in a fire deficit (i.e. more biomass should have burned than has). In more recent times (i.e. the latter half of the 20th century to the present), there is both anecdotal and scientific evidence that fire frequency and intensity are increasing like this [paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5789/940) or this [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-008-9201-9). A lot of this increase stems either directly or indirectly from fire suppression itself, but importantly, this is within the context of a human induced decrease in fire severity/frequency as described above. In general, fire suppression has changed the way fires burn as not having more frequent fires means that lots of 'fuel', i.e. brush, shrubs, etc accumulates so when a fire does occur it can become more intense than what might have been typical prior to human intervention. Also, 100+ years of fire suppression means that people have built infrastructure / buildings deep into the wilderness that might have burned much more frequently before large scale fire suppression became a common practice.

In more recent times (i.e. the latter half of the 20th century to the present), there is both anecdotal and scientific evidence that fire frequency and intensity are increasing like this [paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5789/940) or this [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-008-9201-9). A lot of this increase stems either directly or indirectly from fire suppression itself, but importantly, this is within the context of a human induced decrease in fire severity/frequency as described above. In general, fire suppression has changed the way fires burn as not having more frequent fires means that lots of 'fuel', i.e. brush, shrubs, etc accumulates so when a fire does occur it can become more intense than what might have been typical prior to human intervention. Also, 100+ years of fire suppression means that people have built infrastructure / buildings deep into the wilderness that might have burned much more frequently before large scale fire suppression became a common practice. This does mean that coupled with an actual measurable increase in fire frequency and intensity in the last years, there is also more infrastructure at risk meaning that there is more awareness of individual fires.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 13464, "stickied": false, "score": 6, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 18:28:14 2017", "ups": 6}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/75fv3l/are_wild_fires_getting_worse_or_are_they_normal/", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "Ionizing radiation does what it says on the label.

I stood for the pledge, but after age seven never so much as mouthed the words.Only later did I discover that the widespread adoption of the Pledge is an artifact of Red and anarchist scares of the early 20th century, with a religious clause added still later during 1950s McCarthyism. Frankly, I could understand some manner of a more subdued version of the oath to support and defend the Constitution, as an option for more mature students.

The flag merchant saw the potential for getting the Pledge stuck in the schoolroom, almost like somebody today thinking about getting a vending machine in every class room. Eisenhower, during the Cold War, saw it as a good \"rallying flag\", added \"under 'god'\" and passed an act that schools start the day with it.    By adding the \"under 'god\", and ordering it be part of the public school system, Eisenhower was violating the First Amendment, making a law regarding a religion. Nobody took it to court then because that would have labeled the plaintiff a Commie.    It is the Pledge that needs to be protested. This is a Democracy, not a Republic.

He also took $10,000 from Harvey Weinstein's lawyer for not prosecuting him *after actress  Ambra Gutierrez wore a wire for the NYPD SVU and recorded a partial confession from Weinstein*.This story is back to the Ivanka and Trump Jr. fraud case, and this is another $10,000 from a *different* Trump Organization lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz.  Anyway,>The disclosures are the fourth in a week showing that Vance received campaign donations from law firms whose clients had potential cases before his office. IBT previously reported that Vance declined to prosecute Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and received $182,000 from partners at the law firm of Weinstein\u2019s long-time attorney. IBT also reported that Vance received more than $42,000 from lawyers at a criminal defense firm whose clients received plea deals from Vance\u2019s office that let them avoid prison, including another high profile sexual assault case.Vance needs to step down and be investigated, and every case he refused to prosecute needs to be reviewed.  Also Kasowitz, Abramowitz, and Weinstein's lawyer need to be investigated and disbarred for bribery.This seems somewhat similar to [former Philadelphia DA Seth Williams, who plead guilty to accepting a bribe, stepped down as DA, and is awaiting sentencing of up to 5 years in prison.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/us/philadelphia-district-attorney-seth-williams-bribery-guilty-plea.html)  No reason to not expect the same or worse for Vance.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 91770, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 22:57:46 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "What happened to the $50k \u201cdonation\u201d he got?

If I didn't include the names you wouldn't have known if I was talking about Hillary Clinton, or Jeff Sessions!    /s    One of the discussions I had leading up to the election was with someone who wanted marijuana legalized, and his argument was simple: Anything less than full recreational legalization was a step in the wrong direction.  Clinton's offer to reschedule marijuana, relax federal enforcement of marijuana prohibition, and protect recreational states was written off as just a way to allow pharmaceutical manufacturers to make bank on research, he actually saw incremental progress as moving backwards.    (In retrospect I think, I *hope* he was a troll, but one can never tell these days.)    My argument, wasted on deaf ears though it was, was to look at the gay rights movement.  At first homosexuality and sodomy were illegal (Which is dumb, because sodomy is awesome, but I digress), and gay rights activists fought to overturn those laws.  Now homosexuality was \"legal,\" but not gay marriages, so gay rights activists fought and they secured the right to civil unions in states across the nation.  But of course civil unions are not the same thing as full marriage, so they continued to fight all the way to the Supreme Court, which finally ruled that prohibiting the rights of homosexuals to marry was unconstitutional, and today we have nationwide gay marriage rights.  What would the LGBTQ community look like today if folks had said \"We won't accept civil unions, they're a step in the wrong direction!\"?  I doubt we would be where we are today.

Clinton's offer to reschedule marijuana, relax federal enforcement of marijuana prohibition, and protect recreational states was written off as just a way to allow pharmaceutical manufacturers to make bank on research, he actually saw incremental progress as moving backwards.    (In retrospect I think, I *hope* he was a troll, but one can never tell these days.)    My argument, wasted on deaf ears though it was, was to look at the gay rights movement.  At first homosexuality and sodomy were illegal (Which is dumb, because sodomy is awesome, but I digress), and gay rights activists fought to overturn those laws.  Now homosexuality was \"legal,\" but not gay marriages, so gay rights activists fought and they secured the right to civil unions in states across the nation.  But of course civil unions are not the same thing as full marriage, so they continued to fight all the way to the Supreme Court, which finally ruled that prohibiting the rights of homosexuals to marry was unconstitutional, and today we have nationwide gay marriage rights.  What would the LGBTQ community look like today if folks had said \"We won't accept civil unions, they're a step in the wrong direction!\"?  I doubt we would be where we are today.    The next time someone tells you that \"both sides are the same\" I want you to give them a really mean look, like this -_- and tell them they're wrong.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 485663, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 21:34:43 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "And LGBT individuals.

That said, this is a huge case, and I'd argue the needle points to SCOTUS determining that a warrant is necessary. One thing here is that although Reddit, and liberals in general, hated Scalia, he was a *massive* champion of limiting the power of the police.  Gorsuch is much more of a wild card, but I still think the law favors the petitioner (the defendant).The question raised at cert is this (eg, SCOTUS picked this case to address this specific issue): \"Whether the warrantless seizure and search of historical cell phone records revealing the location and movements of a cell phone user over the course of 127 days is permitted by the Fourth Amendment.\"  This is what SCOTUS will be hammering on.The most relevant case here is [US v Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Jones_\\(2012\\)) from 2012, which is the case where SCOTUS determined that installing a GPS to track someone constituted a search *per se*; therefore, a warrant was necessary to track the person.  Although this case, is *technically* a 4th amendment case, I think the key element here is weakening the '[third party doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_doctrine)' from a legal perspective.  The TPD is the idea that if you **willingly** give information to a third party, its fair game for cops.  So if you commit a crime and post pics to facebook, you can't later claim 'but those were private!' - tough shit and don't be dumb next time.However, location data is a grey area b/c you are not **willingly** giving it.  You're never posting your cell/location data - its just taken.  Cops have previously demanded this data w/out a warrant b/c its been deemed to be covered by the TPD.  However, there are some *very* valid arguments that this data should not be subject to the TPD b/c its just 'taken' from you with neither express nor implied consent.  Put differently, if cops need a warrant to track you using a GPS device, shouldn't cops also need a warrant to pull that same tracking data from ATT?I could go on for hours about this, but the TLDR is this: several SCOTUS justices have talked/written about how much data is surreptitiously recorded about our lives, and the courts have never been clear about how its capable of being used.  The 4th amendment protects us from the government secretly tracking us (without a warrant); however, what is the relationship and liability when corporations can do the exact same thing?  The judicial branch is not going to get in the discussion of whether or not corporations can track us (not today anyways); however, I think they will issue a ruling here preventing cops/law enforcement from using the power/capacity of corporations as an 'end around' for the 4th amendment.

That said, this is a huge case, and I'd argue the needle points to SCOTUS determining that a warrant is necessary. One thing here is that although Reddit, and liberals in general, hated Scalia, he was a *massive* champion of limiting the power of the police.  Gorsuch is much more of a wild card, but I still think the law favors the petitioner (the defendant).The question raised at cert is this (eg, SCOTUS picked this case to address this specific issue): \"Whether the warrantless seizure and search of historical cell phone records revealing the location and movements of a cell phone user over the course of 127 days is permitted by the Fourth Amendment.\"  This is what SCOTUS will be hammering on.The most relevant case here is [US v Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Jones_\\(2012\\)) from 2012, which is the case where SCOTUS determined that installing a GPS to track someone constituted a search *per se*; therefore, a warrant was necessary to track the person.

It's a very common occurrance that among adults men are called \"men\" and women are called \"girls\". Why do people use a word that's meant to be used for female children when they talk about adult women? It even happens that \"man\" and \"girl\" are used in the same sentence when both persons that are being discussed are adults. At least to me it feels almost patronizing, as if a woman isn't adult enough to actually get called a woman, so she gets called a girl. And I know some people use it as a sort of endearing term, like the commong thing in movies where a charming man saying \"hi girls\" when he walks into a room and all the women sort of giggle and look coyly at him. But really, calling an adult a girl is a bit weird because the word girl carries with it some connotations, like na\u00efvety and childish innocence, that I wouldn't really see as suitable for a grown woman.Another similar thing I've noticed is that when talking about famous people, men are most often spoken about using their last name, while women are often spoken about using their first name. I've most often seen this in my studies (comparative literature) where many female authors are spoken of using their first name while for male authors their last names are used. Why is this? Personally I believe it's because there's a tendency to make men seem more professional, which using their last name enforces, and women are made to seem softer and more approachable, so their first names are used.While this are pretty small issues compared to things like violence and discrimination towards women, language does affect how we think and behave. And because of that it annoys me when grown women are called girls.

I have teamed up with a group of people with a passion to eradicate Violence Against Women and Girls and we are planning, organising and co-ordinating at least one event per day during the 16 days (November 25th to December 10th). This initiative is hugely important because:- there has never been a city-wide initiative like this before in Scotland (or in fact the UK).- events will include art exhibitions, seminars, conferences, film screenings, talks and workshops among others- events will be for everyone who wishes to be involved, from all communities and walks of life- discussions will include: sexual abuse/harassment; domestic abuse; mental health; female genital mutilation/cutting; child protection; forced marriage/child marriage; gender justice; slavery and human trafficking among others- most importantly, these events are being planned on a budget of exactly \u00a30. Partners have kindly contributed their own time/skills/energy/talent/resources in order for these event to take place, and the aim was that when men and women work together peacefully and collaboratively, great things can be achieved. Please take a moment to check our website: http://16days.org.uk/ and our blog: 16daysofempowerment.wordpress.com to see what is happening.

My neighbor with schizophrenia can hear every time I open my door (and arrive in my car/open my garage) and comes to talk to me. It annoys me sometimes and I'm a pretty private person but I try to be nice and have a small chat before moving on.My boyfriend has on holiday for a week (gets home tomorrow) and since he left I've felt a lot less safe. My neighbor has been stopping me to talk more and more often. I started to feel cornered and uncomfortable and I started to dread meeting this guy.Tonight I heard knocking on my door and someone calling out. He wanted to cook a frozen meat pie for me, when I said no thanks he said \"what is my food not good enough for you or something?\" He asked what food I do want and again I refused and he said he just likes to help people. He just stood there awkardly before leaving. I went to hang up some clothes later and shut the garage door behind me because it freaks me out when he comes in to talk to me. On my way back to my apartment I tried to quickly get past his door and up the stairs when he came to his front door and called out my name. He had no shirt on and said \"You know you're not very easy, I mean it's pretty hard to get into your panties.\" I just swiveled and went up to my place while he shouted apologies up the stairs. I shut and locked the door. I'm pretty easily triggered because of my history but still suprised I'm this rattled. I feel trapped in my tiny apartment and I'm dreading the morning when I have to walk past his door to drive to work. (I've asked my other neighbor to escort me)I told my boyfriend what happened and he said to get my dad to pick me up, stay at my parents and call the police and emergency realestate number. That seems crazy to me, I just want to drive to the real estate and talk in person. Preferably bf would be eith me for support. The thing is this neighbor got yelled at by his friend and his way of coping with it was self harm.

On the way home, I told my friends about my mini hook up with the new guy and two of my friends  instantly started to slut-shame me. I was completely shocked because my friends are typically fairly accepting of each other's sexual fun. It turns out that the group of guys were from a bachelor party, and I had just hooked up with the bachelor. I had no idea. My friends would not let it go, even though I told them I didn't know he was engaged. The guy never told me. However, according to my friends, I should have asked if he was single. Was I wrong to assume that someone is single if they are willing to make out with me? According to my friends, I should have known that he was taken. According to my friends, I am a homewrecker and that I could have potentially ruined a future marriage. Of course, they didn't blame the guy for being a complete cheater and creep. I told my friends that this is no way my fault or my problem that he guy wasn't honest with me. I scolded them for judging me. I think they finally understood that it wasn't my fault or my problem that the guy decided to cheat. They ended the conversation with a \"only God can judge us for our actions\" type of bullshit.
