But that was only a small part. I was also a geeky tomboy and I grew up hearing how cool I was that I liked \"boy\" things like video games and stuff, and how lame girls were, how I was so different and unique. So I internalized that I, a girl, was naturally lame unless I somehow differentiated myself from the rest of girls. Boys bullied me too, but the few friends I *did* have ended up being boys because we shared interests. See, I wasn't lame like other girls who only cared about fashion and gossip! And because I was often the only girl in a group, I'd feel insecure and not welcome other girls into the group because dammit, I had worked hard to carve my little niche here, you won't take it away! I longed for connections with other women but my internalized misogyny made me insufferable to be around. Now, much older and wiser, I no longer feel or act that way.

It is as if your presence is an inconvenience. And for what? Only because you happened to be breathing the same air that other girl may be, too. Unfortunately, just because you are another girl, you often become an instant enemy.Mutual girl hatred of one another is prevalent in our society. While in fact I am making a generalized statement, most girls can agree that there often seems to be an underlying factor of distaste in our mouths as we walk by another total stranger girl. Why is this? Why do girls dislike other girls they know nothing about?Women are creatures of necessitated approval, even if that means fighting others for it. When we notice something to feed our egos, we cannot help but throw ourselves at it. This becomes an issue as we begin filling our egos in the wrong way...feeding off other girls' self esteems. It seems as if over time it has just become a natural occurrence for girls to be quick to cattiness with one another. Our brains attribute beauty and personal appearance to the social construction of success. The other girl is so much prettier, slimmer, taller, and better than us.

But that was only a small part. I was also a geeky tomboy and I grew up hearing how cool I was that I liked \"boy\" things like video games and stuff, and how lame girls were, how I was so different and unique. So I internalized that I, a girl, was naturally lame unless I somehow differentiated myself from the rest of girls. Boys bullied me too, but the few friends I *did* have ended up being boys because we shared interests. See, I wasn't lame like other girls who only cared about fashion and gossip! And because I was often the only girl in a group, I'd feel insecure and not welcome other girls into the group because dammit, I had worked hard to carve my little niche here, you won't take it away! I longed for connections with other women but my internalized misogyny made me insufferable to be around. Now, much older and wiser, I no longer feel or act that way. I've met some really awesome women, and some of those friend-boys of my youth I had tried so desperately to impress ended up being shitty people.

Some of the amino acids do something similar: they simply vaporize when heated to a certain temperature.When you heat something to melting, you're causing bonds or crystal structures to weaken to the point that the molecules are capable of sliding around on each other. This holds true for most of the things we're used to: simple chemicals like water, salt, metals. But, if there are bonds inside the molecule that are even weaker than the forces keeping it a solid, then adding vibration (heat) is going to break those apart before the substance can get hot enough to liquify.Wood is complicated, because it's got a ton of different substances inside it. When we make charcoal, wood is heated in an oxygen free environment. As the temperature is increased, a bunch of gases are released as water and oils evaporate, and sections of proteins decompose. Some of these gases can be condensed back into liquids, but I wouldn't call these \"melted\" wood: more that the wood released these chemicals as it was heated.Heat the wood even more, and you'll get charcoal, basically pure carbon. You could continue heating this for quite a while, up to 4000K, before it starts to change state. Unfortunately, carbon at atmospheric pressure does much the same as dry ice: it sublimates straight into a gas instead of melting. To get liquid carbon, we have to add one more factor: pressure.According to the diagram here:https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6068/what-is-known-about-liquid-carbonThere is a combination of temperatures and pressures capable of creating liquid carbon. This occurs above approx. 5000K, and 3 kBar (about 43000 PSI).

When the training ended he bought me a plane ticket and paid for everything when I visited him. We showered together and he washed my hair and often made loving, romantic gestures. He pushed for exclusivity and got jealous at the mention of others, even when I told him he had nothing to be worried about.  And yet he has had a girlfriend for the last six years. I ghosted as soon as I found out. The manipulation that went on was mindblowing. This guy had me so convinced that he cared, I'm sure just as convinced as his gf. She deserves to know, but I'm not sure if I should be the one to say. Another source of guilt comes from something much more serious.  Trigger warning.

I [21F] am becoming very frustrated with my vagina and need help figuring out what is happening. I have been seeing a new guy [23M] within the last 5 months and in the beginning the sex was regular and often several times within a day. There was no pain, burning, nothing. About a month in, I start on the birth control pill, Aubra (Levonorgestral and Ethinyl Estradiol 0.1mg/.02mg) and he also started to cum inside me. Still no pain, but because he was cumming inside me, my vagina had a fishy smell afterwards. I\u2019d take a few probiotic pills and the smell would go away. I figured my pH was just being thrown off balance because of his semen. Now, starting about a month and a half ago, the pain began. When he initially inserts, there is a mild burning sensation on the outside of my vagina that gradually builds up to become less and less tolerable. If we have sex the night prior then try to have sex in the morning the sex is unbearable. We have somewhat rougher sex but it has been that way since we\u2019ve started sleeping together. After every session, there is swelling, soreness, painful urination and after some sessions I noticed small cuts on the outside of my labia. Obviously where the tears are, there is a great deal of pain, but even when I put pressure on areas where there is no tears, the painful burning sensation persists. Can anyone help me put a finger on this? I did see a gynecologist and he figured it was a yeast infection, put me on Diflucan with no results. The pain is still there. Any help will be appreciated. TLDR; I\u2019ve been seeing my boyfriend for 5 months, but not until a month and a half ago have I started to experience a burning sensation on the outside of my vagina during sex. Please help.

Trust me, I'm a stranger on the internet, this will get better and chances are you are gonna LOVE sex, because there's so many aspects to love!! Bonding, deep emotional moments, amazing physical pleasure, playfulness, laughter, getting lost in the moment, some people use sex for meditation and a spiritual practice!! Its a dynamic and fantastic thing that is in your deepest nature as a human and thats just fact. You are totally capable of getting to the point where you can truly enjoy sex! However, here is some fantastic advice to help you get from where you are to where I sense you want to be someday:First of all DITCH THIS DUDE!! The fact that you're being vulnerable enough to open up to him as your first sexual partner, and he's not creating a safe and fun place to explore means 1. He's bad at being a sexual partner and 2. He's not a nice guy. Maybe he's nice but he's too immature or dumb to figure out that you need support in exploring and finding things that you truly like (or don't like), but either way you'd be much better off with him nowhere near your genitals. He's not doing his job as your first sexual partner!! Sex is weird and awkward before it's fun because you don't know what feels good and you are not used to it so it's hard to feel comfortable enough to get much physical pleasure out of it. The job of your first partner (if they are more experienced) is to create a safe and fun and supportive space to explore and learn and teach and try new stuff. He is doing a BAD JOB. You don't suck at sex. You're new. He sucks at sex, how you feel about sex right now proves that.Second of all here is a list of resources. The best way to get comfortable with sex is to LEARN about sex. So do some reading! Listen to some podcasts. Wanna learn to give a killer blowjob? The info is out there and it may be a little odd to start learning about, but it's fun information to know!! 1. www.scarleteen.com - Tons of info on everything from sexual health to gender identity to bodies and how they really work2. Sex+ is a YouTube channel (look up Laci Green if you can't find it). They are short entertaining videos and she talks about EVERY QUESTION YOU COULD HAVE or at least almost every question. How to give a good blowjob? Wanna find your g-spot(do yourself a favor and figure out your g-spot, omg it's the best)? How to tell if your sexual partner is a douche?3. If you're into podcasts, start listening to Dan Savage on the savage love podcast. Super sex-positive, sassy gay man gives advice to people that call in with sex and relationship problems. It's entertaining and will give you a taste of a really sex positive culture. It may be a little raunchy for a 17 year old but maybe that's okay with you.4. Buy yourself a copy of the book \"Self esteem, the 3rd edition\". This isn't about sex but this book will change your life. 5. Go to a bookstore and look in the sex section. Just browse. Look at sexual positions, read about how to give a good bj, you can find so much in any ol' Barnes and Noble. 6. Get with a partner that knows how to be a good partner!! A partner who treats you like your feelings are important, and understands that your process is going to be like MOST girls process in discovering sex is: confusing and slow but eventually fucking awesome! Your boobs are great, everyone thinks theirs are wrong but they aren't. Promise. You're as hot as you feel and in 4 years you will probably feel 1000 times more sexy than you do now. That's how it was for every single one of my friends and most of us are in our late 20s and early 30s now. Ditch this guy, wait for a cool dude to come along that treats your sexual experience and pleasure like a super exciting puzzle that he gets the honor of solving, not like it's something you're not delivering on.

I though I was absolutely terrible in bed. I wasn't very good at blow jobs, and tbh, he never put in much effort in getting me off and I always felt so guilty when I couldn't with his minimal effort that I faked it for three years. In those three years I didn't get more experienced, I didn't get \"better\" at it, I just developed this really warped idea around sex and thought that I was broken because I couldn't orgasm within two minutes of starting. Do you know what changed? Having sex with someone who was actually attracted to me. The first guy, again wasn't very 'attentive' let's say, so I still thought I was broken, but you start to feel a hell of a lot better when it's with someone who is actually attracted to you.Then I met my current boyfriend and holy shit did things change. I feel so unbelievably confident in bed because he makes me feel that way. Don't get me wrong, if one of us is doing something the other doesn't like it gets said. But I feel so much more confident, and genuinely enjoy it so much more. I also discovered that I'm not broken, I just need a bit longer and a bit more effort than the last two were willing to give (and I haven't faked it once with him either).I won't tell you whether or not to stop having sex with him, but I will say it changes once you're with someone who is actually attracted to you (whether that be a purely sexual fling, or a long term loving partner). The other thing is when you're a teenager, everyone has a warped view of sex because of porn and TV, but once you start getting into adult relationships (again either purely sexual or romantic), people start to grow up and realise the world (and people's bodies) isn't like what they see on TV. So don't get yourself down on it.And one last thing? This guy sounds like a dick and I really think you should go get some better friends. But if you want to talk, just drop me a message.

Last year me and my now girlfriend met at a narcotics anyonomos meeting and hit it off from there. From someone who didn\u2019t know her she seems like a typical preppie girl, big house in a nice neighborhood etcAfter about six months of being together she opened up to me about her past. Growing up she didn\u2019t have a father . Her mother was going through a hard time when she was ten years old and had her live with a good friend of hers until she was twelve . The women she stayed with  ended up raping her and molesting her as well as physically and verbally abusing her through the course of those two years . Not too long after, she started getting into drugs and alchlohol, getting blackout drunk every night since she was thirteen. Her addiction continued to progress through her teens as she ended up dating multiple abusive boyfriends, one of whom ended up setting her up with a heroine dealer to get raped, not once, not twice, but three times. She ended up going out on drug binges and staying away from home for long periods of times, all the while getting abused by other men and so forth, with a 50 bag a day heroin habit. By the time she was 16 her and a friend went down to cop, and ended up getting in a fight with a few gangbangers who shot him, and kidnapped her, tied her up in a basement where she was raped multiple times. She managed to get away and stole a car to get home. The ended up finding out it was her who stole the car , she didn\u2019t say a word about the kidnapping  and took all the charges. This all seems like it\u2019s straight out of a horror movie , I have never been through anything like that and I still have a hard time sleeping just hearing about it. Meeting her I had no clue, she\u2019s this quite pretty blonde girl who doesn\u2019t seem like she has ever been through anything like this . She has night terrors still and , this poor girl can\u2019t go anywhere and feel safe. I don\u2019t to make her relive anything , I don\u2019t want her to feel like a victim and I have shared my own stories of sexual abuse with her, which where nowhere near as bad as anything that she has told me. I could understand how it seems like she is making these things up for attention, but it took me a very long time to get her to open up and I would bet my life that she is being honest . It would be so far out of her character to ever do anything like that. I don\u2019t think I have ever caught her in one lie. The fact that she is alive and well today is nothing short of a fucking miracle. I could only begin to imagine how misunderstood she must have been her whole life, or how years of that living hell makes her feel to this day. I don\u2019t pity her or for view her as less than in the least, I have nothing short of respect and admiration for her , because I can understand her now and see who she really is. This girl has stuck by me through a lot, and she has played a huge role in how I view women to this day. She taught me how to stay loyal to a partner and not be with someone new every week.But I know her baggage isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. I\u2019m certain she can heal and live a comfortable life and be comfortable on her own skin again if she puts in a little work and doesn\u2019t shut down. I wish everyone know this girl like I knew her. I\u2019m with her every night trying to encourage her to reach out to a rape recovery center or maybe share some of these things with her family, or take it to the police . I\u2019m also ready to jump and seriously hurt some of these people who did these things to her, I know the heroine dealer personally and I know where he traps out of, her ex is out of jail again and I wouldn\u2019t think twice about maming this kid, but she doesn\u2019t want that, and it isn\u2019t right for me to take my own anger issues and involve it with her issues . I\u2019m not qualified to handle this,  but I made a decision to stay with her and try to do the next right thing if it doesn\u2019t begin to bring serious unnanageability into my life. But due to my own issues , it might head into the direction . Me leaving her due to her past would seriously hurt her, but I know her enough and trust her recovery enough to know she would be alright in the long run . I\u2019m not big on posting on reddit, but looking at this girl and talking to her one would have no idea . I know she is not the only one, in these things are 10 times more common than someone might think. I\u2019m on here reaching out to maybe get some feedback from someone who has been through something like this and who might be more qualified to give suggestions , and possibly relate to her . So with that I\u2019m going to wrap this up because it seems like I\u2019m rambling at this point , any feedback would mean a lot , thank you in advanced .

On the second point, it seems clear that for the immediate future, our society as a whole lacks the ability to take steps that will reduce the likelihood and/or toll of mass shootings (and of gun violence generally). That's why we need to immediately support mandatory firearm liability insurance that will help victims of gun violence and their families better cope with the financial toll taken by firearms. And for any \"gaps\" that firearm liability insurance would not cover, we should support a fee on firearm sales that would go toward a \"Gun Violence Victim Fund\" to defray the financial cost of gun violence.  We should work on all fronts to confront gun violence, but mandatory firearm liability insurance is something that can be done now to assist those impacted by gun violence.https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/74zk2l/candidate_for_nevada_assembly_calls_for_mandatory/", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "753j46", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "We Should Fight For Mandatory Firearm Liability Insurance and the Establishment of a Gun Violence Victim Fund.", "num_comments": 2, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 2581, "permalink": "/r/esist/comments/753j46/we_should_fight_for_mandatory_firearm_liability/", "submission_time": "Sun Oct  8 22:44:36 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Follow the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/esist/wiki/rules).
