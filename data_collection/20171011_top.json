We started off in an office and had to solve several puzzles to unlock the door that led to the lab. In that lab, an actor gives a bunch of exposition about our mission. We have to split the team. One team stayed in the \"clean area\" and the other had to put on gas masks (so as not to be exposed to the zombie toxin) and go into the contaminated section of the lab to seek out chemicals needed to find a cure and a badge that would let us out of the lab once the cure had been made.Without giving too much away, we searched all over the \"contaminated area\" and couldn't find a damned thing. There was a jail cell with a body in it that I eventually found a crawl space to get into, but there was nothing of use there. As I started to crawl out, I noticed a door I had not seen on my way in. I opened it up and entered what was obviously a \"backstage area\" that I wasn't supposed to be in. When I turned to re-enter the room, I found all the \"chemicals\" we needed, and the badge we were looking for right next to the entrance.

Think about it for a second. There's probably a building in your town -- perhaps more than one; perhaps a grand and ornate building, almost certainly on land that could house something else -- that's devoted to the idea of free-at-the-point-of-use public education and entertainment. Anyone, rich or poor, can go to that building, and with minimal fuss take out enough reading material to last them multiple lifetimes, all with the understanding that, in a couple of weeks, they'll bring it back in good condition so that other people can use them. And people actually do it! Almost every time! I can't think of any other system that operates on such a profound level of trust in the positive side of human nature, but there you go. That's libraries for you.And sure, there are some people who advocate for getting rid of library funding -- 'Let people pay if they want to use it,' they say; 'Let the free market step in,' they say; 'Netflix for books,' they say. Well, I say fuck those people right in the ear. A library is so much more than just a room full of books. It's one of the great social levellers. It's computer access for people who can't afford it at home. It's social groups and a meeting place for old people. It's ebooks and movies and music. It's recommendations for things you haven't yet discovered. It's evening classes for people who need basic English, maths and computer skills. It's a place where young parents can go and encourage a child's voracious reading appetite without breaking the bank, and where a child with a hunger for books can go and figure out what her tastes are in a completely risk-free environment. Hell, sometimes it's just a place to kill an hour when it's cold outside and you're waiting for a bus -- and that's fine too. Moving to a subscription model might save you a fractional amount of your tax bill, but it would take necessary services away from the very people who need them most. That's a level of 'Fuck you, Jack, I've got mine' that I couldn't even *begin* to sanction.And they're dying, in a lot of places, because people don't use them. Because people don't get outraged when politicians cut their funding. Because programs like Overdrive -- that's free ebooks delivered direct to your device with your library card -- aren't as well-known as they should be. Because people don't know you can get out-of-state access to libraries' worth of audiobooks for free, or for far cheaper than a yearly Audible account. Because they keep strange hours *as a result* of this limited funding, which makes people less likely to visit, which makes them an even bigger target for cuts.

(Like in the future - due to their high birth rates plus mass immigration- 2050 onwards)Do you like art? HaramDo you like concerts? Do you like music even? HaramDo you like books that aren't religious? HaramDo you like tv shows or movies? HaramOh you really want to go to the Old vic in London? It's a mosque now.Do you like going to clubs? Bars? Pubs? Haram.  All gone.Do you like being able to kiss whoever you want in public? HaramDo you feel happy to live in the west as a homosexual? Because you won't anymore. Do you want to take your dog through the local park? Can't. Haram.Do you like wearing what you want as a woman? Ha say goodbye to that.Oh you really like famous Christian architecture? A mosque now of course.Enjoy xmas and easter? Gone. Christian holiday innit.Do you like being able to openly show your faith if you're Christian or a jew? Yeah about that....Basically, I could sum it up by saying, do you like freedom? Because we'll slowly lose it. The fact muslims will be the worlds most popular religion breaks my heart. It should worry everyone.Yes individual muslims may be nice and all.But as a group, do you think they'll care about a 'kafir' or whatever they call them. Islam is the most oppressive religion in the world. Muslims are about appeasing their 'god'. Not non muslims.Do I even need to detail what muslim countries are like? Do you want more of them?And this isn't even going into deeper issues like FGM, grooming gangs, terrorism. (Yes I know, not all muslims etc)This is my nightmare.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 462, "stickied": false, "score": 26, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 16:07:48 2017", "ups": 26}, {"body": "Sword Art Online.

We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto: \"Anyone can cook.\" But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France.

There is a lot of bad advice and a lot of poor rationale tossed around. The most common one I see is the idea of just sticking it into a \"low fee index account\" as an investment. I wanted to dispel some of those ideas and provide a more sensible approach that you can use when daydreaming about winning. So you just won. Let's say, for ease, that you won a $185m jackpot, which nets out to just a few thousand dollars shy of $100m post-taxes (39.6%). How do you proceed?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1) Tell no one. This is common advice, and it's completely correct. Not only will family and friends start begging for money (or treating you differently), but you are likely to have frivolous lawsuits come out of the woodwork. You will want to keep your windfall quiet until your legal affairs are in order, and it's best to minimize how much people know thereafter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2) Engage an attorney. Not a family friend, not someone you found in the phone book. Pick a firm from the top 10 of this list and ask for their Estate/Wealth team. Explain your situation (that you have just won a $185m jackpot and want to engage their services to plan and manage the claim) and do not settle for an associate - you want someone at the Partner level. They want your business so they will certainly be willing to either fly you to their office or will send someone out to you. I am not deeply knowledgable on the inner workings of this part of the process but it is likely that they will set up a series of trusts through which they will claim the prize, allowing you to keep your name out of the papers.Yes, Skadden or whoever is going to cost you more than your family friend. A local attorney will bill you $200 an hour for your time. A Partner at Skadden is going to bill you $1000 or more per hour. But the benefits are going to far outweigh the cost - not to mention if they fuck it up somehow (they won't), you have a company with a significant balance sheet to lay claim against.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------3) Managing your wealth. Your attorney will help advise you on the best way to go with this, but you have several options. Managing your money yourself through ETF's and index's is not one of them. That is fucking stupid. If you want to play with some cash in the market you can take $100k and do so with no real risk.So your options are really just these two:a) Asset wealth management / private banker: In this option you will be set up with a small team of individuals at a major firm (JP Morgan, UBS, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, etc.) who will look to maintain and grow your wealth according to a set of parameters and a risk profile as agreed upon by yourself and the firm. They can provide a wide array of options, from you flat out telling them that you want your risk to closely track the equity markets (which they will advise against, for good reason), to the inclusion of bonds and derivatives, to what the industry refers to as \"alternatives\" (hedge funds, private equity, etc.). I do not recommend this option as the fees they take are not insubstantial and they have incentive to push high-commission products on you.b) You can hire a family office. A \"family office\" is an industry term for a group of professionals and support staff who's sole task is to manage your affairs, your money, and your interests. Here is a white paper on the conceptual and internal portions of a family office, written by Credit Suisse.You can either hire on an established family office (called a \"multi-family office\" - one who takes care of the affairs of multiple families) or build out your own. They will be able to provide just as wide, or even wider, an array of products as a AWM/Private Banker as they can simply engage them as needed, but will also be able to provide options that are perhaps more suitable for you. For instance, a real estate boom of unprecedented rapidity in Phoenix may go largely unnoticed by an AWM team, your family office can analyze those trends and invest in condo developments in that city. They also operate without the conflict of interest inherent in AWM/PB on the commission side. They are paid a salary and potentially a bonus/management fee.But their services extend far beyond your finances. Let's say you have a horse at your summer home in Montana that you would like brought down to your winter home in Texas. A single text message to your family office handles that - \"need Mr. Cloppy @ ranch in Texas by sep 15th\". Done. The rest is handled by them. When you want to buy a piece of property to build a home they will handle it for you. They will negotiate mortgage rates, they will analyze contracts, they will set up meetings with architects. Everything. Their job is to run your life as much as you desire so that it's not your problem. A friend of mine was dating a girl and her father believed that he was below her station (he was). The head of the family office was the one to deliver the message that he was to break up with her.Work with your attorney to establish a family office. Let them handle your shit. They will be smarter than you are about basically every subject that matters. And they have your interests at heart, because their employment and compensation is aligned with your well being and happiness.(Note: A single-family office is best at around $100m and up, but still viable (especially as a \"hybrid\" family office) down to around $50m. Multi-family offices will still work down to ~$25m. Below that you are in AWM-only territory.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------4) Take a vacation. There is going to be a not-insignificant delay between the start of this process and when your winnings are collected, if for no other reason than that it will take time to establish the legal entities for your family office and the trusts/shell companies that the winnings will be moved through. But it's also just a good idea to wait in order to mask who won. So you should take a vacation. Like everything else your attorney will handle this for you, but you will want to take out a line of credit in order to fund your vacation. That's no problem, as banks will extend lines of credit against lottery winnings.. So take a 6 month vacation, spend $750k of your winnings, live it up. My recommendation would be to get out of the United States, because your absence is going to get noticed and you're not going to be able to hide your elation forever. Go live in St. Barts for a bit. Use that time to get in shape, to read up on the finances that will effect your life so that you know what is going on. Go overseas and study your favorite subject at Oxford for a few months. Go to Santorini and spend your next few months fucking beautiful women. The world is your playground now.And use that time to sort out, rationally, what you want to do with the next X many years of your life. Figure out the best ways to get to that goal with the help of your legal counsel and family office (which, if done right, will have a lawyer as part of it). If you want to start a cupcake making business this would be a great time to start planning, and you can spend a bit of cash to be taught what you need to know to make the best cupcakes by a world renowned pastry chef.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------5) One-off bits of advice.\u2022Use your attorney/family office as a buffer between yourself and all of the bullshit handout requests from your family. Your family office head is going to be a smart guy, and he will be able to identify the difference between a bullshit money grab and a legitimate request from a family member, so if you tell him \"we can give up to $50k a year to family\" he will do that. And he will also be there to be the bad guy when it's time to tell your cousin that you haven't seen in 17 years to get fucked asking for money to buy a Dodge Charger.\u2022Do not hire your friends as employees. If you want your best friend from college to be around all the time, don't do it by making the guy your driver or your chef. Just give him $80k a year so that he doesn't have to work if that's what you want. Making them an employee is going to eventually build a sense of resentment. You are permanently altering the power structure in your friendship well beyond their dependence on you for an income - you are making yourself their superior. \u2022Don't buy a yacht. Charter them when you want to use one. They are an incredible waste of money. 1/5th the original purchase price per year for maintenance alone, plus crew costs, fuel, etc.\u2022Watch closely those who enters your circle of friends. You will have hangers on. You will have people try to take advantage of you.\u2022If you're a guy, get a fucking vasectomy. I think the reasons are patently obvious and you can still have kids without issue. There is no downside.\u2022If you're a single guy and you plan to go on a bang-bender a prime avenue for extortion is falsified sexual assault claims. Wire your house up with hidden cameras. I don't think you can legally have them in the bedroom in any state (edit: Some people are saying that you legally can. Based on my quick research of the laws surrounding nanny cams, it appears to be correct.), but the ones throughout the public area of your house should suffice.

I still remember them saying something like \"everyone gives birth near the full moon, it's going to be a madhouse here soon, just you watch.\"  They were right.  Also, I guess it is important to say for the sake of preventing some of you from pointing your finger in the air and proclaiming 'Mmmmm, but it is the law that labor rooms must be private!'-- the labor rooms were private, but only when people were literally giving birth; before contractions were a certain length of time apart they kept two women per room.Anyway, as I said, it was a madhouse.  I will never forget all of the moaning and screaming and the wild eyes of women as they squeezed their husband's hands and the husbands looking so helpless and trying to wave down the short-staffed nurses to no avail.When I showed up with my mom (never knew my dad) to my Aunt's room there was already a couple in there.  The women appeared to be what I'd now call Southeast Asian and the man looked like he was Irish or something.  I remember they were bickering back and forth about a name still, which at the time I didn't even find odd, but besides that nothing seemed out of the ordinary.  I was bored and curious so I walked about the hospital unimpeded by any of the staff because they were so overwhelmed.  After a while I decide I'm hungry and decide to return to the room to ask my mom for some money so that I can use a vending machine or something and as just as the doors to the elevator open on the maternity ward I hear some kind of commotion.  There is crashing and banging and screaming and I can literally feel the floor rumbling.  Much to my surprise I immediately see my mom and my Aunt out in the hallway, my super prego Aunt standing against a wall, mid-contraction, with a look of horror on her face.My mom sees me and yells \"/u/neotericleaf, get back in the elevator now!  Go to security!\"... but it was too late, I had already stepped off of the elevator and I was in some kind of stupor not knowing what the hell was going on.  My mom ran over to me, picked me up (which was impressive because I was already 130lbs and she was no more than 110lbs) and carried me down the hallway and pushed me into some kind of lab.The lab had a bunch of windows and it was really dark out and almost all of the lights were off, don't ask me why, but I soon realize I'm not alone.  Over in the corner there is a shadow.  Some dude was standing there and scared the shit out of me.  He said something like \"oh, sorry buddy, it is a little too crazy out there for me, I don't like all that attention\" and it disarmed me a bit.  Then there was awkward silence and my stomach rumbled.  \"Heh, you're hungry too hunh?  Man, I haven't eaten in a while either.  How about you go grab us a snack?\" and then it looked like he was reaching into his pockets and shuffling around before saying \"Oh, crap, I left my wallet at home in a rush, do you have anything on ya that you can lend me?\"  Talk about awkward situations.  There was still all kinds of hell breaking loose back out in the hallway.  I sort of stuttered \"Uh, I was gonna ask my mom for some money for the vending machine, I can see if she will give me some for you too.  H-How much do you want?\"  He moved out from the shadows and it was at this point that I realized that I was looking at a gigantic head of an eight story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Only his head was sticking through the window and his body was standing in the parking lot.  Then he told me how much he needed, which I can't completely remember due to shock but it was somewhere between 3 and 4 dollars.I run out of the room screaming for my mom only to see that between me and my mom was the asian woman giving birth and from her were these tentacle things that now remind me of that Men in Black scene where that woman gives birth to the \"squid\".  One of the nurses faints immediately, but one of the doctors, obviously a seasoned vet, was unphased and in an effort to rally his staff said something like, get a hold of yourselves, yea, we're in the shit, but this is nothing, don't you remember that just last year the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.  This pretty much put everything into perspective and the rest of the birth went off without a hitch.  I'll never forget the face of that poor Irishman though... he *had* to have known that the child was not his own for it closely resembled a crustacean from the paleozoic era in it's form only, because it weighed in at only 11lbs 4oz, which I hear is small all things considering.I'm happy to say that my Aunt went on to give birth to a pair of healthy twin boys.  I never did eat that night and I had nightmares for pretty much a week.The last I saw of the Irishman was him in the parking lot chasing down what I can only assume was the real father, but the guy literally jumped into a large lake across the street to get away.

I still remember them saying something like \"everyone gives birth near the full moon, it's going to be a madhouse here soon, just you watch.\"  They were right.  Also, I guess it is important to say for the sake of preventing some of you from pointing your finger in the air and proclaiming 'Mmmmm, but it is the law that labor rooms must be private!'-- the labor rooms were private, but only when people were literally giving birth; before contractions were a certain length of time apart they kept two women per room.Anyway, as I said, it was a madhouse.  I will never forget all of the moaning and screaming and the wild eyes of women as they squeezed their husband's hands and the husbands looking so helpless and trying to wave down the short-staffed nurses to no avail.When I showed up with my mom (never knew my dad) to my Aunt's room there was already a couple in there.  The women appeared to be what I'd now call Southeast Asian and the man looked like he was Irish or something.  I remember they were bickering back and forth about a name still, which at the time I didn't even find odd, but besides that nothing seemed out of the ordinary.  I was bored and curious so I walked about the hospital unimpeded by any of the staff because they were so overwhelmed.  After a while I decide I'm hungry and decide to return to the room to ask my mom for some money so that I can use a vending machine or something and as just as the doors to the elevator open on the maternity ward I hear some kind of commotion.  There is crashing and banging and screaming and I can literally feel the floor rumbling.  Much to my surprise I immediately see my mom and my Aunt out in the hallway, my super prego Aunt standing against a wall, mid-contraction, with a look of horror on her face.My mom sees me and yells \"/u/neotericleaf, get back in the elevator now!  Go to security!\"... but it was too late, I had already stepped off of the elevator and I was in some kind of stupor not knowing what the hell was going on.  My mom ran over to me, picked me up (which was impressive because I was already 130lbs and she was no more than 110lbs) and carried me down the hallway and pushed me into some kind of lab.The lab had a bunch of windows and it was really dark out and almost all of the lights were off, don't ask me why, but I soon realize I'm not alone.  Over in the corner there is a shadow.  Some dude was standing there and scared the shit out of me.  He said something like \"oh, sorry buddy, it is a little too crazy out there for me, I don't like all that attention\" and it disarmed me a bit.  Then there was awkward silence and my stomach rumbled.  \"Heh, you're hungry too hunh?  Man, I haven't eaten in a while either.  How about you go grab us a snack?\" and then it looked like he was reaching into his pockets and shuffling around before saying \"Oh, crap, I left my wallet at home in a rush, do you have anything on ya that you can lend me?\"  Talk about awkward situations.  There was still all kinds of hell breaking loose back out in the hallway.  I sort of stuttered \"Uh, I was gonna ask my mom for some money for the vending machine, I can see if she will give me some for you too.  H-How much do you want?\"  He moved out from the shadows and it was at this point that I realized that I was looking at a gigantic head of an eight story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Only his head was sticking through the window and his body was standing in the parking lot.  Then he told me how much he needed, which I can't completely remember due to shock but it was somewhere between 3 and 4 dollars.I run out of the room screaming for my mom only to see that between me and my mom was the asian woman giving birth and from her were these tentacle things that now remind me of that Men in Black scene where that woman gives birth to the \"squid\".  One of the nurses faints immediately, but one of the doctors, obviously a seasoned vet, was unphased and in an effort to rally his staff said something like, get a hold of yourselves, yea, we're in the shit, but this is nothing, don't you remember that just last year the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.  This pretty much put everything into perspective and the rest of the birth went off without a hitch.  I'll never forget the face of that poor Irishman though... he *had* to have known that the child was not his own for it closely resembled a crustacean from the paleozoic era in it's form only, because it weighed in at only 11lbs 4oz, which I hear is small all things considering.I'm happy to say that my Aunt went on to give birth to a pair of healthy twin boys.  I never did eat that night and I had nightmares for pretty much a week.The last I saw of the Irishman was him in the parking lot chasing down what I can only assume was the real father, but the guy literally jumped into a large lake across the street to get away.  It was nuts.

However, if the size of that volume increases to infinity the gap between different allowed energies approaches zero and you get a continuum.  Thus, one can say that the physics of a confined particle and a free particle are very different. However, this is only true if one is considering physics whose energy scale is much less than the energy gap associated with this confinement. For example, a system of particles at room temperature on Earth (~300 K) has ~0.025 eV (electronvolts, a unit of energy) of thermal kinetic energy. Thus, such a particle, like say an electron in a solid, will only behave \"differently\" than a free particle if you confine it so much that the discrete energy gaps become larger than 0.025 eV (which occurs for electrons in silicon if you confine it to a volume of less than ~10 nm, something that is happening in the trillions of transistors driving the computer you're using right now - electrons in MOSFET transistors exist in an effective 2D world because of this quantum confinement).  If you confine it to a larger box than ~10 nm, say so that energy gap is ~0.0001 eV (which is much smaller than the 0.025 eV of thermal energy) then it will behave like a free particle because the \"fine detail\" of its structure of allowed energy is hidden by the much larger fluctuations in energy brought about by the thermal motion; kind of like a microscope that isn't zoomed in enough so that a material we know is made of a complex structure of animal cells, just looks like skin.So, coming back to your original question,  in an infinite universe \"free\" particles have continuous energy spectra, where in a finite universe (whether it be finite in the sense that it ends, or if it's periodic, where you loop back to where you start) energy spectra are discrete.  HOWEVER, this is only discernable if we consider phenomena whose energy scale is less than the discreteness. And the larger a finite universe is, the tinier this discretization detail is.We have never observed \"discreteness\" of free particles, so either the universe is infinite, or it's at least big enough such that the discreteness is tinier than our ability to detect.  Which brings us to the pragmatic answer that if the discreteness ends up being tinier than an energy scale we could EVER, even in principle, be able to discern, then it pragmatically makes no difference.  Everything will effectively behave as if it were a continuum anyway.

However, if the size of that volume increases to infinity the gap between different allowed energies approaches zero and you get a continuum.  Thus, one can say that the physics of a confined particle and a free particle are very different. However, this is only true if one is considering physics whose energy scale is much less than the energy gap associated with this confinement. For example, a system of particles at room temperature on Earth (~300 K) has ~0.025 eV (electronvolts, a unit of energy) of thermal kinetic energy. Thus, such a particle, like say an electron in a solid, will only behave \"differently\" than a free particle if you confine it so much that the discrete energy gaps become larger than 0.025 eV (which occurs for electrons in silicon if you confine it to a volume of less than ~10 nm, something that is happening in the trillions of transistors driving the computer you're using right now - electrons in MOSFET transistors exist in an effective 2D world because of this quantum confinement).  If you confine it to a larger box than ~10 nm, say so that energy gap is ~0.0001 eV (which is much smaller than the 0.025 eV of thermal energy) then it will behave like a free particle because the \"fine detail\" of its structure of allowed energy is hidden by the much larger fluctuations in energy brought about by the thermal motion; kind of like a microscope that isn't zoomed in enough so that a material we know is made of a complex structure of animal cells, just looks like skin.So, coming back to your original question,  in an infinite universe \"free\" particles have continuous energy spectra, where in a finite universe (whether it be finite in the sense that it ends, or if it's periodic, where you loop back to where you start) energy spectra are discrete.  HOWEVER, this is only discernable if we consider phenomena whose energy scale is less than the discreteness. And the larger a finite universe is, the tinier this discretization detail is.We have never observed \"discreteness\" of free particles, so either the universe is infinite, or it's at least big enough such that the discreteness is tinier than our ability to detect.  Which brings us to the pragmatic answer that if the discreteness ends up being tinier than an energy scale we could EVER, even in principle, be able to discern, then it pragmatically makes no difference.  Everything will effectively behave as if it were a continuum anyway.

The diverging section (bell) allows the gases to expand, speed up, and drop in pressure. The specific bell shape comes about to control the expansion of the gas. Ideally, the gas is allowed to expand just enough that the pressure of the gas at the nozzle exit equals the pressure of the atmosphere around, and the shockwave from the gas changing from super to subsonic occurs at the exit plane. If the nozzle is too big at the exit, the gas pressure drops below the atmospheric pressure and atmospheric air actualy enters the engine and drops efficiency. Shocks also form inside the engine nozzle. If it is too small, the gases exit the nozzle at a higher pressure than atmosphere, and you lose efficiency because the air has left over energy that could be converted to velocity still.

There is a reason for that, which is that the visible spectrum lies in a bit of a 'gap' energy-wise. The infrared region affects molecular rotation and vibration, while the lowest-energy excitations of electrons often happen in the UV range. (for your average organic molecule maybe 200 nm or so) Thermal energy at the temperatures we deal with are all a bit down in the IR (things have to get pretty hot to start glowing after all), so we don't have a problem with thermal noise. It's mainly transition-metal complexes and certain large organic molecules that have low-energy enough electronic transitions to absorb visible light.So besides plenty of visible light being around, it's high enough in energy that you don't have thermal noise, but low enough in energy that it's not being absorbed by any and every molecule. So we could evolve chromophore molecules that absorb in specific ranges of the the visible spectrum. These work by being very [long chains of alternating single-double bonds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Beta-Carotene_conjugation.svg) (conjugated chains). The longer the chain, the lower the energy required to excite a valence electron in the chain. But there's a limit for that somewhere in the red. I.e. we can't gain IR sight just by making longer chromophores.So when it comes to pythons and other animals that 'see' IR, it's a different thing entirely. Again, since IR corresponds to molecular motion energy-wise, IR and heat aren't really distinguishable. IR 'vision' works through using heat receptor enzymes more like those we have in our skin than to the photoreceptor enzymes in our eyes. At the opposite end, you can't have just too short a chromophore because once you get well into the UV the absorbance will overlap with all the other organic molecules in your tissue. This is neat but it'd all be moot if we didn't have visible light around. So it's a combination of factors.

There is a reason for that, which is that the visible spectrum lies in a bit of a 'gap' energy-wise. The infrared region affects molecular rotation and vibration, while the lowest-energy excitations of electrons often happen in the UV range. (for your average organic molecule maybe 200 nm or so) Thermal energy at the temperatures we deal with are all a bit down in the IR (things have to get pretty hot to start glowing after all), so we don't have a problem with thermal noise. It's mainly transition-metal complexes and certain large organic molecules that have low-energy enough electronic transitions to absorb visible light.So besides plenty of visible light being around, it's high enough in energy that you don't have thermal noise, but low enough in energy that it's not being absorbed by any and every molecule. So we could evolve chromophore molecules that absorb in specific ranges of the the visible spectrum. These work by being very [long chains of alternating single-double bonds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Beta-Carotene_conjugation.svg) (conjugated chains). The longer the chain, the lower the energy required to excite a valence electron in the chain. But there's a limit for that somewhere in the red. I.e. we can't gain IR sight just by making longer chromophores.So when it comes to pythons and other animals that 'see' IR, it's a different thing entirely. Again, since IR corresponds to molecular motion energy-wise, IR and heat aren't really distinguishable. IR 'vision' works through using heat receptor enzymes more like those we have in our skin than to the photoreceptor enzymes in our eyes. At the opposite end, you can't have just too short a chromophore because once you get well into the UV the absorbance will overlap with all the other organic molecules in your tissue. This is neat but it'd all be moot if we didn't have visible light around. So it's a combination of factors.

I believe the process also passively removes some of the heat from the shield as a side effect since it's carried away by the hot vapor.This method is also used in the nozzles of some rocket engines in cases where it would be excessively expensive or heavy to incorporate an active cooling system (such as the often-used method of piping the cryogenic propellant through the walls of the nozzle before combustion, which is effective but complex).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 23357, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 07:16:59 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "There is not burning from reentry, but heat to the point where the air becomes ionized and a plasma, and the material is red hot and begins to vaporize.

Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.http://rense.com/general37/fascism.htmLooks like we can check off item #6 on the list.  By my count, that makes it 12/14 that are easily confirmed.  Congratulations America, you are only 2 traits away from becoming a textbook fascist nation!  I mean, #14 is all but a given, but I'll wait for Mueller to finish before I consider it proven.  **EDIT**: Since this comment is getting some attention I suggest everyone follow the link and read the book summary on the same page.  It is personal stories from German citizens during Nazi rule.  It was originally printed in 1955, so they are first hand accounts of how fascism slowly took hold.  Here are some key excerpts that sound all too familiar:*  \"What happened here was the gradual habituation of the people, little by little, to being governed by surprise; to receiving decisions deliberated in secret; to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand, or so dangerous that, even if he people could understand it, it could not be released because of national security. And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him, made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it.\"* \"\"Those,\" I said, \"are the words of my friend the baker. \"One had no time to think. There was so much going on.\" \"Your friend the baker was right,\" said my colleague. \"The dictatorship, and the whole process of its coming into being, was above all diverting. It provided an excuse not to think for people who did not want to think anyway. I do not speak of your \"little men\", your baker and so on;...we were decent people - and kept us so busy with continuous changes and \"crises\" and so fascinated, yes, fascinated, by the machinations of the \"national enemies\", without and within, that we had no time to think about these dreadful things that were growing, little by little, all around us. Unconsciously, I suppose, we were grateful. Who wants to think?\"* \"To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it - please try to believe me - unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, \"regretted,\" that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these \"little measures\" that no \"patriotic German\" could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.* \"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \"Jew swine,\" collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in \u00f6 your nation, your people \u00f6 is not the world you were in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 18893, "stickied": false, "score": 1094, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 19:34:50 2017", "ups": 1094}], "subreddit": "politics", "selftext": "", "libertarian": 0.2092628628, "id": "75pb5b", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Donald Trump threatens to shut down NBC and other TV news networks that criticise him", "num_comments": 8141, "conservative": 0.11154655370000001, "pinned": false, "score": 58019, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 218173, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/75pb5b/donald_trump_threatens_to_shut_down_nbc_and_other/", "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 18:12:16 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "As a reminder, this subreddit [is for civil discussion.](/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil)In general, be courteous to others.

I've been a prosecutor, I still work as an attorney for a state government. First caveat.  I'm setting aside any allegation that Vance took \"campaign contributions\" relating to suspects he had under investigation. That would be highly unethical and could be illegal if there was any evidence of a quid pro quo. Second, I'm not as familiar with the intricate details of the trump case so that's outside the scope of this post.On to the point:  Part of the role of a prosecutor is to conduct the triage of the justice system.  Prosecutors have prosecutorial discretion.  They sort through all the cases and citations and general trash that police departments bring them, and decide which cases are worth filing and pursuing, and which cases are not.  This is actually a really important role, because it's the same discretion that lets the prosecutor decide to walk away from a case where the police violated someone's rights or someone gets arrwsted for something that doesn't Merit it because they pissed off the cops. Every elected prosecutor manages a budget for his office.  he has limited office staff, limited man hours, limited money for investigations, scientific testing etc.,   *Part of his role as prosecutor is to decide how to best spend that money to enforce the law in his jurisdiction* by deciding which cases are worth bringing and which cases are not worth bringing.   For every huge marquee case, there's a dozen others that might not get very much attention, because the prosecutor and his staff are too busy. I agree with the article.  IF what's represented as true, that the victim will testify Harvey Weinstein grabbed her breast against her will, then tried to talk her into coming into his hotel room for a sexual liason, you have a fairly clear cut case of sexual assault. You may also have a case of harassment.   Fairly simple case, but the victim is your key witness. Then you have a brief officer to talk about their wire capture system, and the recording they took, and play the recording. BUT, the only charges you can be sure you'd stick would be either an [A misdemeanor forcible touching](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article130.htm#p130.55), (\"forcibly touches the sexual or  other  intimate  parts  of  another person  for  the purpose of degrading or abusing such person, or for the purpose of gratifying the actor's sexual desire\")  or a B misdemeanor Sexual assault in the third degree (\"subjects another person to sexual contact without the latter`s consent;\")  An [\"A Misdemeanor\"](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/a_misdemeanor.htm)  in New York is a *Maximum* of one year in jail and three years in probation, or a fine of up to $1000. A [B Misdemeanor](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/b_misdemeanor.htm) in New York is a *MAXIMUM* Of 90 days in jail or one year probation or a fine of up to $500. Now, let's get to the uncomfortable part.  Wealth matters. Even if the prosecutor 100% removes that from consideration of his decision, it's going to make the case different and more difficult to handle. If you execute an information and arrest warrant for Harvey Weinstein, he's probably not even going to be within the city when that happens and he's going to hire top grade criminal defense lawyers.   Those lawyers will have an unlimited budget, and they will throw up every possible roadblock in your case.   The attorney's going to have to go through a roadblock on a motion to dismiss, then a roadblock on scheduling an arraignment on a special day, dealing with additional security for a celebrity defendant, then a roadblock on turning over all their information.  The victim is going to have her name splashed all over the press, and they'll trash her name in the press as well to try to get her to recant her story (Did you check with the victim that she knew this was going to happen?)    The case will take a disproportionately large share of man-hours and time and money and what's the result even if you win?  The Defendant is likely going to get slapped with a fine and a couple days in jail.       Then they'll threaten to drag it out in appeals and ask that he remain free pending appeals, and maybe the victim has to go through the whole process a second time.  It's not at all that difficulty to see why Vance might have said \"am I really going to commit hundreds of man hours of time to tag a billionaire movie producer for sexual assault because he grabbed the breast of a movie star just to make him pay a $1000 fine and spend a couple days in jail?\"     Or with the same time that will take, should I have the same lawyers work on 15 cases for \"run of the mill\" criminal defendants who need to be taken off the street and who otherwise might not have attention devoted to their cases because of overworked staff.  Does this mean that someone who can afford attorneys to throw up roadblocks at every stage of the process gets special treatment because they're rich?  yes, absolutely, there's no sugar coating that and it's wrong.  But it's a part of the process that's near impossible to resolve, because the system affords protections, and that means people who have money and time to throw up roadblocks can do so.

That said, imho it's not comprehensive enough and doesn't cover everything. It should be expanded upon, and does not do anything about the fact that 80% of the island likely can't yet access a working ATM let alone find papers in a ruin & a working scanner & a computer with net access...

He knew he wasn't allowed access to that data and got another employee to share their login info.

Hacking means nothing under US law. The law that convicted this guy said \"Whoever having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access, and by means of such conduct having obtained information ...\". The guy who was convicted was convicted not because some judged shouted \"HES A HACKER, LOCK HIM UP\". He was convicted because he knowingly accessed a computer without authorisation. He knew he wasn't allowed access to that data and got another employee to share their login info. You can call it *hacking, social engineering*, or *computer fraud*, but it doesn't matter what you call it. The law says \"don't do this\" and this guy is in jail because he did that.2. The EFF is not saying that this guy is a great guy and he should be allowed to do whatever he wants. The EFF doesn't like this law because it is vague. What does \"without authorization\" mean? Does it mean that if you share a facebook account/password with someone and that other person does something you don't like with it you can say 'Well I didn't authorise you to do that!' and then that other person is a hacker?Though I think the concept of hacking is really vague. Because hacking is just telling a computer to do something and it responding in the way it is programmed. What makes clicking a link fine, but sending a POST request to an obscure API node that should have been close wrong? The thing that makes it wrong is what the maker says is wrong. Think about the concept of theft. I might leave my house unlocked. I might put a pebble on my lawn, but it is still my property and my pebble. I own it, though the ownership is abstract and there is nothing different about it. I don't label my possessions, and I don't lock them all up. The only real identifying factor is where my possessions are. They are in my house or on my person. When you go to the digital world literally everything is abstract.

Every post he makes drives me crazy for it's genereal lack of factual relivence. Here is is post about the recent Boy Scout/ Girls news.\"A quick note on the Boy Scouts deciding to remove any remaining reason for their own existence by admitting girls.Many people have told me that this is good and fair because the Boy Scouts offers the opportunity to do things that girls can't do in Girl Scouts. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's completely irrelevant.Here's a crazy idea: maybe not everything in society needs to be centered around giving opportunities to girls. Maybe not everything is about girls always. Maybe some things are about boys and for boys. Or used to be, anyway. It's OK for boys to have their own spaces. It's OK for boys to do their own thing sometimes. Or it used to be, anyway.Boy Scouts are supposed to be for boys. That's the whole point. It's right in the name of the organization. Boy Scouts were meant to help boys become men. Girls don't need help becoming men because they're girls.This may be a scandalous notion for feminists, but guess what? Sometimes boys like to just be around other boys and have the kind of male bonding that is simply not possible if girls are forced into the mix. And this bonding is important. It's essential to the healthy formation of boys.I know there are girl who like to say, \"I'm just one of the guys, really.\" But you're not. You're not one of the guys anymore than I'm one of the girls. Maybe you like camping and sports and whatever else, but that doesn't make you a boy, nor does it entitle you to intrude into every single male space or male gathering.And we wonder why our boys are struggling so much. They're growing up with the impression that there's nothing special or unique about boyhood, and their desire to just be with the guys sometimes is wrong and bigoted. They're made to hate themselves and forced to bond with girls in a way that's unnatural and unfulfilling, pretending that they see the girls just as they see other boys. It's confusing, degrading, and unfair.Meanwhile, girls can still have their own spaces. Except for the locker room. Boys can go there. Because nothing makes sense in our ridiculous culture.\"Source: https://www.facebook.com/MattWalshBlogAlso, he apparently worked for Glenn Beck.

But I do understand why GSUSA is against it, beyond just money and enrollment numbers. I work as a counselor at a Girl Scout camp now, but I used to work at a coed camp. The way girls act in mixed groups is often different from how they act in single gender groups. I'm sure it's similar for boys. Female campers at the coed camp didn't speak out as much and they didn't share their opinions as freely, mostly because they were too nervous or shy to. They tended to gang up against girls who were \"weirder\" or more tomboyish. Those girls sometimes found a place among the boy campers, but were often never entirely included and felt alone.At my current camp, even the shyest campers become very talkative and while some cliques do form, *everyone* ends up with a friend. More than that, they all seem much more spirited and willing to be themselves entirely. It doesn't matter if they're more \"feminine\" or more sporty, they all genuinely try to get along and have fun together. They speak out more about what they want to do.**Mixed groups *do* have different dynamics, and that's something that BSA will need to take into account going forward.**A lot of people have mentioned GSUSA being \"out of touch\", and while they do have a lot they could improve on, I don't think many of the people saying that have had recent, in depth contact with the Girl Scouts. Your experience with Girl Scouts largely depends on your troop leader, the exact same way your experience with Boy Scouts will vary from troop to troop. I personally had a bad experience with my own troop when I was younger because we only did cooking and art badges, but even then, the local council still sponsored outdoor-oriented events too. Going to Girl Scout camp, where I got to spend a week or more in an open platform tent, learning wilderness skills and whatever else I had signed up to learn, was a much better experience for me than my first troop. When I got older, I moved and was able to join a different troop that did more camping oriented activities. I have a friend whose troop saved their cookie money and went to Europe for a month, and another who opted to go on a canoeing trip in Canada. It's different for everyone.More than that, Girl Scouts teaches a lot of important skills and values. At camp, everyone is responsible for their own mess, and when we do cookouts, the girls prepare the food and collect firewood themselves. They get to pick several activities they want to do at the beginning of each week. Counselors are also taught to stress sticking together and helping other girls, as well as all people, and understanding those who think or act differently from yourself. They also have a massive focus on trying to get girls interested in STEM right now.One person's experience in Girl Scouts doesn't define Girl Scouts as a whole.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1008, "stickied": false, "score": 115, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 12 01:49:32 2017", "ups": 115}, {"body": "Girls and boys working together in wilderness, citizenship, and craftsmanship throughout their adolescence can only help them to understand and respect each other more when they are adults.

It will also depend whether the company you work for has a sexual harassment policy.  Because of this, the only real advice you should listen to is from a lawyer in your jurisdiction, who specializes in employment law.  Most lawyers specialize in one or two areas of law because there is simply too much to know in every area.Many jurisdictions have services that provide free legal advice.  These are often \"legal clinics.\" In some jurisdictions, the governing body of lawyers provides this service, or a referral to such a service.In relation to whether the company can investigate sexual harassment even if you did not make a complaint - it's not unusual.  Many companies will want to investigate such a situation to shield themselves from potential liability, because, in many jurisdictions, the \"employer\" has a legal duty to protect their employees at work.  If there is a potential sexual harassment situation, and the employer DOESN'T investigate it, it can make them legally liable.  With that said, it's bizarre to me that \"word\" of this sexual harassment investigation is apparently common knowledge amongst everyone.  Normally, these sorts of things are dealt with confidentially, for many reasons.  The only other suggestion I could give to you is to carefully consider who you speak to regarding this.  If the company is up to no good with this investigation, anything you say could be turned against you.  I am not sure if you have a contract of employment, or if the company you work for has any HR policies regarding harassment.

I started working at his family's business. (About 50 employees) We broke up. (My idea) It was hard, but we made it through and continued to work together. We had some emotional struggles, but whenever something came up at work, we took distance or a mental health day or some space. Our work was not impacted. We did not have discussions or anything of the kind in the workplace. We kept that stuff at home, because we're adults. We even own a business together on the side.&nbsp;Fast Forward to 6 months after the breakup, and the business owners (his parents) inform me they are investigating allegations that I was sexually harassed at work. I didn't make any complaints. In fact, I told his mother in a personal conversation (so personal we discussed her granddaughter's need for easier access to tampons in the conversation), that we had resolved everything and our friendship and business relationship were better than ever.&nbsp;One working day later, she tells me that he is suspended from work. I will now only work in the office under her direct supervision, literally across my desk from me. (I do all their web design, social media, marketing, etc) She tells me they have hired an investigator to look into the sexual harassment that happened at work. I tell her there was nothing, and I don't want an investigation. She tells me she would like me to cooperate with the investigator but I don't have to. I told her I was uncomfortable with the new work situation and wouldn't be into work for a while, jotted off an email about training a replacement if that became necessary (NEVER SAID THE WORD QUIT), and went home. &nbsp;I am getting phone calls at home from coworkers I have never even talked to outside of work, asking questions about this alleged sexual harassment. Someone even suggested there was a quid pro quo sex for employ situation. My reputation has been utterly trashed. According to someone else, patrons of the business (I work in the back office, I never encounter patrons) have come forward as witnesses to events that never happened. A coworker I have literally never spoken to allegedly made a report about witnessing an incident... This is the worst game of telephone ever. Everyone is getting in on the action.&nbsp;My Ex/BusinessPartner/NotHarassingBoss is banned from talking to me by his parents. I cannot conduct my own business. (Crucial tight launch schedule, he is integral to our business, this is damaging our business)&nbsp;I didn't tell anyone at work about the process of our breakup. Nothing happened at work beyond one or the other of us taking a long lunch break or day off without any drama. I never made any allegations.&nbsp;I feel like I am being gaslighted. How can the owners, the coworkers, etc. keep telling me I was sexually harassed, if I wasn't? Can they even do an investigation into something on my behalf if I say it didn't happen? I worked SO HARD to keep it together after the breakup and be a strong business woman and handle things with dignity and I was really proud that it didn't damage my work. But here they are, insisting I am the victim over and over and over with lawyer's letters and investigator phone calls, and emails.&nbsp;The owners have moved my full-time position to seasonal employ and said that even if I did come back, I would end when the season ends on Oct. 31, so I have basically gotten fired. I can't find an attorney who wants anything to do with a mess like this in my small town. Even if I could, I am a single mother of two. I don't have cash for an attorney. I barely have the cash to pay my bills.&nbsp;I am trying to hard to deport myself with dignity, but it is not happening. I feel like it is worse harassment to insist to me that I have been harassed when in truth I worked very hard to keep my work life professional to the utmost extent.&nbsp;TLDR: I said I wasn't sexually harassed. Why won't they believe me and why are they having a lawyer investigate? This can't be right.&nbsp;EDIT: Adding in tons of stuff because I can.&nbsp;EDIT: Thank you to everyone for the friendly conversation and suggestions. I haven't been able to discuss this with anyone due to my desire to be discreet, and it has been enormously therapeutic and helpful to vent a bit and hear others thoughts on the issue.

Maybe it'll hit you like ton of bricks later. Whatever you feel, it's okay to feel that way. B) The fact that you \"just laid there and went back to sleep afterwards with no problems\" doesn't mean a damn thing. What the heck else were you supposed to do? You were on sleeping pills. You weren't in pain or danger after it happened. You're allowed to sleep in your own bed and then decide how big a deal something is AFTER you are fully awake and aware in the morning.

Are you okay with this happening multiple times? Because a guy who doesn't take 'no' for an answer the first time, who may not even think he did anything wrong, is definitely not going to listen the next time or the time after that. If you don't at the very least call him out on this (and I vote for a full on screaming-rage-fight, preferably through a telephone, since if silent glaring didn't do the trick then volume might, but that's just me) then the message he is going to take away from this morning is that you're fine with it. Or, maybe you aren't fine with it, but just like leaving the toilet seat up or not doing his share of the dishes, it's not that big a deal. He absolutely will do it again.

I made my \"quit that, it's annoying\" sound and slept for what was probably just another minute or two before he was doing it again. I grunted more aggressively and he stopped again. I went back to sleep and then was roused again (not sure how long I slept that time) with my boyfriend pulling my PJ pants off. I sleepily made another \"stop it\" sound, but it was pretty obvious what I was saying because my boyfriend replied, \"Hey,\" in this tone that suggested, \"Just be quiet and let me do this, please.\" I wasn't speaking because I take meds for insomnia and words were a bit beyond me this early in the morning. However, I remember I was clear in what I meant because my boyfriend did respond by stopping a few times, and then even went so far as to tell me to stop complaining. Despite being under the drugs I remember thinking pretty clearly, \"Wow, this is happening. I'm actually being raped. I told him to stop and he basically told me to shut up.\" So I just laid there and let him finish. Afterwards he was acting like he always does after sex, as if this was a normal encounter. I just sort of sat there and glared at him. I eventually went back to sleep because it was ridiculously early. It doesn't really feel like I was raped though. I know I was, since I'm a firm believer in stopping when the other person says no, but I'm feeling that since I just laid there and went back to sleep afterwards with no problems I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is. My strongest feelings about this are, \"You're sort of an asshole.\" I don't feel like my life is that changed. I don't feel like it'll even impact our next sex encounter. Things rape victims say they feel afterwards I'm just not feeling. My attitude towards the whole situation is pretty much, \"Meh.\" I know I should be more upset. I know I should even break up with him after this, but I probably won't. Basically, I was raped (I think) and don't care all that much.

There is probably nothing wrong with you or your testosterone (although it can't hurt to get it checked), this is just how your body works right now. You may find that your libido comes roaring back into action in a couple years, or maybe this is just gonna be your normal from here on out. Either way, one thing that definitely *isn't* going to bring it back is stressing out about it. Worrying about it, taking pills for it, all of that is just putting pressure on yourself and pressure is not arousing. My best advice is to just let it be. You may develop stronger sexual desire in the future, you may not. Try to be okay with both of those options. So, what to do in the mean time? If you're not completely repulsed by sex (and be thankful if you're not, some women find their sex drives swinging into full anti-sex mode!), then keep on having sex with your husband with as much enthusiasm as you can muster. Some people are in the camp that you should never have sex unless you are 100% into it, but personally, I've never subscribed to that. I'm rarely 100% into doing a lot of the necessary stuff I do (work, chores, maintenance) but I do it anyway because it's important to continuing to enjoy all the other parts of my life. Keeping your sexual partner happy is emotional maintenance that you can choose to do because you appreciate everything else your partner contributes to your shared lives and it's your way of taking care of him. If it's important to him, and not painful/repulsive/unpleasant for you, then go ahead and keep doing it even if it feels obligatory.On that note, most guys are okay with replacing full penetrative sex with more frequent blowjobs and handjobs. If that's easier for you and still gets his needs met, you might want to start doing them more often. I do this a lot myself when my husband has had a rough day and clearly needs some release but I don't really feel like getting it on myself; it's a nice low-energy activity that he really enjoys, and he doesn't have to know that I'm actually thinking about a work assignment or a new craft project while I'm doing it. ;3 Lastly, if you have a hard time talking about this... welcome to the internet! Anonymity is a wonderful thing. Make some sockpuppet accounts, find you some sympathetic ladyfriends, (hello!) and go ahead and lay it all out. Sometimes it can be easier talking to complete strangers than it is to talk to those close to us, knowing that nothing is at stake and you can ghost off without consequence if you feel uncomfortable.

Forgive the crass and sexist generalisations for a minute and go with me on this - what is it like to have such a strong visual link to arousal?I mean, I am obviously very interested in penises for all sorts of reasons. I am very turned on by the way they feel, the way they respond to my touch. The way the taste, they way they move inside me. All those things, even the imagination or memory of all those things, is powerfully arousing. But I have next to zero interest in pictures of penises, in any state. They just don\u2019t do anything for me. I don\u2019t watch much porn - I don\u2019t object to it, it just isn\u2019t a quick route to arousal for me. When I masturbate I prefer my own imagination. When I do watch porn, I need it to have a story, something I can believe in, before it gets to the sex. God, I\u2019m starting to sound like such a cliche.Guys have said to me that porn is great when they want a quick and easy wank without having to think... and I know what they mean, sometimes building a fantasy takes time and effort and you just want a quick orgasm. For that, I generally relive something from my own sexual past, using my memory to shortcut the buildup and jump straight to the hot bit. But for guys, it seems like they can look at some naked women, or a video of some sex, and be instantly aroused - I had an ex who could literally put on some porn and have a wank, all the way to orgasm, in like 2 minutes. It sounds like I\u2019m being critical but I\u2019m really not, I\u2019m actually kind of jealous. I\u2019d love to know what it would be like to have a mind that works that way. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s common in women too, but for men the visual link seems more ubiquitous. And as to the obsession with tits - well - that\u2019s just strange. They\u2019re just mounds of flesh, surely every heterosexual man alive (with access to the internet) has seen literally thousands of them. I honestly think some men, you could sit them down and get an endless line of topless women to walk past, and they\u2019d just starve to death.

Did you know that you have protected rights as a patient? Rights that include having all medical procedures fully explained to you and the opportunity to ask whatever questions you need?If you're comfortable doing so, I recommend contacting the facility and lodging a complaint with the doctor herself. In a perfect world, she just messed up and could improve her shitty behavior with your feedback.If you're not comfortable with speaking with the doctor directly - which is totally understandable - you can file a complaint through the facility, with a different doctor, or through your state's medical society or licensing board. Don't worry about overreacting on this. Doctors have a strict ethics code for a very important reason. If it turns out her behavior wasn't malicious, you're not wrong in expecting at least an apology for her atrocious behavior. If it turns out she's a shitty fucking doctor, then hopefully this will prevent her from traumatizing other women like yourself.I'm sorry this happened to you, and I'm sorry you feel the need to either avoid medical care or be prepared to defend yourself against impropriety. I hate that this needs to be said, but you have the right to refuse medical care, to include stopping in the middle of a procedure like this if you are uncomfortable. You have the right to have your questions answers to your full satisfaction and to be informed of all available options. You have the right to be treated with respect.Patient rights are codified in many different places.

My boyfriend is spectacular and we\u2019ve been together for three and a half years. Lately he\u2019s been more and more vocal about wishing we had more protection from pregnancy than just condoms, especially since my period is usually pretty regular but will rebel against the system every now and then and show up late. It freaks him out every time, and I truly don\u2019t want him to be so stressed, especially since it means it puts him off sex and general intimacy that might lead to sex for long periods of time. We\u2019ve been discussing birth control for ages, but I grew up catholic so it\u2019s always been rather foreign and weird to me. I\u2019m fine with condoms, but I know that\u2019s not good enough for everyone, boyfriend included. I understand his point of view and I agree that we need to be careful. So I have my own health insurance through my job (see posts on r/raisedbynarcissists for that fun backstory) and finally found a doctor taking new patients and set up an appointment for last Friday. I get there and sign in, everything\u2019s great. I meet with the doctor, a woman that I picked from good reviews she had, and she seemed a little brusque but nice enough. She offered some options, and then (a little unexpectedly) wanted me to do my first ever well woman exam right then and there. I figured \u201chey, has to happen eventually\u201d so I go along with it. She gives me the little paper outfit to cover myself with and I undress and get situated. The breast exam went okay, nothing weird. Then she is getting me set up for the Pap smear and her remarks really rubbed me the wrong way. When she pulled out the speculum she said \u201cif you\u2019ve had a penis in there, I\u2019m sure this will be fine\u201d, and like, sure okay, it\u2019s not that big but I feel like that\u2019s not the kind of banter I want to hear from my doctor. She just stuck it in there after saying that, but what if she had been wrong and it was too big or something? It fit okay, and while it was going on I just was super uncomfortable thinking about that comment, but otherwise it was just awkward because of what it was. Right after she was done, she mentioned that some women make weird faces during the procedure and how funny would it be to have a camera in the ceiling to take pictures of the reactions, just like on a roller coaster when they take a picture going down the big hill. Her nurse immediately blurted that it was a joke and the doctor said \u201cof course there aren\u2019t any cameras, don\u2019t worry about it, it was just a joke\u201d, but I felt really gross and even more uncomfortable after that. She didn\u2019t give me time to ask questions about the exam even though I made it clear to her that I\u2019d never done it before. I asked if the Pap smear hurt like I\u2019d read on sites like this before and she kind of ignored me. (It didn\u2019t hurt, fortunately) She didn\u2019t give me time to feel less uncomfortable, just kept telling me to drop my knees and \u201copen up\u201d more. It all went kinda fast so I guess that\u2019s a plus?All this to say, I have a consultation tomorrow with the lady who does IUD insertions at that office and I\u2019m seriously so skeeved out at the thought of anyone else poking around up there any time soon. I don\u2019t want anything put in my body, especially now that that doctor acted the way she did and (honestly) made me feel a little violated. I know well woman exams are a necessary evil but I\u2019m so grossed out at the thought of anyone else doing things the way this doctor did that I\u2019ve put the brakes on the whole idea of birth control. My boyfriend is very supportive and is upset that I had this experience. He will leave the decision up to me in the end. Of course, I\u2019m also going to be finding a new doctor\u2019s office soon, once I look through the list of providers covered by my insurance again.

The bottom line is she was unprofessional and made you uncomfortable. Even the nurse noticed the unprofessionalism, and the doctor failed to provide you care to which you are entitled. Did you know that you have protected rights as a patient? Rights that include having all medical procedures fully explained to you and the opportunity to ask whatever questions you need?If you're comfortable doing so, I recommend contacting the facility and lodging a complaint with the doctor herself. In a perfect world, she just messed up and could improve her shitty behavior with your feedback.If you're not comfortable with speaking with the doctor directly - which is totally understandable - you can file a complaint through the facility, with a different doctor, or through your state's medical society or licensing board. Don't worry about overreacting on this. Doctors have a strict ethics code for a very important reason. If it turns out her behavior wasn't malicious, you're not wrong in expecting at least an apology for her atrocious behavior. If it turns out she's a shitty fucking doctor, then hopefully this will prevent her from traumatizing other women like yourself.I'm sorry this happened to you, and I'm sorry you feel the need to either avoid medical care or be prepared to defend yourself against impropriety. I hate that this needs to be said, but you have the right to refuse medical care, to include stopping in the middle of a procedure like this if you are uncomfortable. You have the right to have your questions answers to your full satisfaction and to be informed of all available options. You have the right to be treated with respect.Patient rights are codified in many different places. Some are guarantees by federal and state law, some are part of hospital or facility policy, and some are part of the medical professional ethos.

According to Mellaart, the proto-Luwian migrations to Anatolia came in several distinct waves over many centuries. The current trend is to see such migrations as mostly peaceful, rather than military conquests.Luwian was among the languages spoken during the 2nd and 1st millennia BC by groups in central and western Anatolia and northern Syria. In the Old Hittite version of the Hittite Code, some, if not all, of the Luwian-speaking areas were called Luwiya.

In the post-Hittite era, the region of Arzawa came to be known as Lydia (Assyrian Luddu, Greek \u039b\u03c5\u03b4\u03af\u03b1), where the Lydian language was in use.

It appears that by the time of the collapse of the Hittite Empire ca. 1180 BC, the Hittite king and royal family were fully bilingual in Luwian.

It appears that by the time of the collapse of the Hittite Empire ca. 1180 BC, the Hittite king and royal family were fully bilingual in Luwian. Long after the extinction of the Hittite language, Luwian continued to be spoken in the Neo-Hittite states of Syria, such as Milid and Carchemish, as well as in the central Anatolian kingdom of Tabal that flourished in the 8th century BC.'", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4055, "stickied": false, "score": 16, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 17:12:45 2017", "ups": 16}, {"body": "I initially read the title as \"found in 1,878 bears\" like the animal.

Boob 'tweeks' do happen occasionally without sexual intent. They kind of stick out. I'm not saying he is a great guy, but this kind of thing is NOTHING like something who's made a career/habit of imposing themselves on women.  I also don't think some actor not doing everything they can to stop alleged sexual harassment from their boss is comparable either. That's not the same as covering up abuse or a pattern or abuse. The biggest issue beside the sexual invasion, is these guys are in positions of power over people and using them to GET AWAY with that. You don't even have to sexually touch someone to use their employment over them to have a significant chance of influencing them, especially younger people. That doesn't seem the case here at all.I would have to say, one boob tweak does not a dirty dog make. Getting on Affleck for denouncing sexual ABUSE by pointing out one time his hand touched sometimes boob, doesn't seem entirely honest.It wreaks of media issue pandering to me. By pretending Affleck's single action is the same as a pattern of abuse by people in professional relationships, is doing an injustice to the real problem, which is men in positions of power ROUTINELY abusing that power and getting away with it. Also, a lot of them and their buddies have influence in the media, which means it's easy to generate false equivalencies. Affleck didn't appear to be trying to get away with anything, he was on camera when this all happened.
