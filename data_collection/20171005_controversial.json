I've also lived in 4 different countries, including South Africa (for 9 years) and I've studied in China, the USA, and have lived most of my life outside the USA.As a white person, I look through this thread and see a few legit examples, but some illegitimate examples.  \"I was dismissed in a conversation about race,\" is not racist to white people.  Being called a nazi is not racism towards you either.  It might hurt your feelings, but you are not a victim of racism because someone calls you bad names.In South Africa, when I was 15, I got into a fight with a black school student.  I was repeatedly told to \"Go back to America!\" and \"We don't want your white ass here!\"  None of these were racist remarks, because they did not single out my experience as a white person and discriminate against me for that.However, if I am in a discussion about South African history, and I have something legitimate to say about it, and I speak up, but I'm put down by someone saying, \"White people could never know about racism in South Africa,\" then that would be a form of racism.  This has never occurred though to me.Racism against white people does exist, but it vastly differs than racism against other groups of people.  White people, for the majority of history, have been the oppressors.  White people, for the majority of history, created the concept of superior and inferior racial identities.So although white people can be victims of racism, they are not close to the same level.

I've also lived in 4 different countries, including South Africa (for 9 years) and I've studied in China, the USA, and have lived most of my life outside the USA.As a white person, I look through this thread and see a few legit examples, but some illegitimate examples.  \"I was dismissed in a conversation about race,\" is not racist to white people.  Being called a nazi is not racism towards you either.  It might hurt your feelings, but you are not a victim of racism because someone calls you bad names.In South Africa, when I was 15, I got into a fight with a black school student.  I was repeatedly told to \"Go back to America!\" and \"We don't want your white ass here!\"  None of these were racist remarks, because they did not single out my experience as a white person and discriminate against me for that.However, if I am in a discussion about South African history, and I have something legitimate to say about it, and I speak up, but I'm put down by someone saying, \"White people could never know about racism in South Africa,\" then that would be a form of racism.  This has never occurred though to me.Racism against white people does exist, but it vastly differs than racism against other groups of people.  White people, for the majority of history, have been the oppressors.  White people, for the majority of history, created the concept of superior and inferior racial identities.So although white people can be victims of racism, they are not close to the same level.  If you ask any person of any color, \"What would you prefer happen to you: be dismissed in a conversation, or have the shit beaten out of you by a police officer?\" white people would have a choice.  For the most part, black people and other groups that have nonwhite skin color not only don't have a choice, but probably deal with both.And if you don't believe me, then what would happen if a black person came into this thread right now to argue this point, how quickly would they be dismissed?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 896, "stickied": false, "score": 9, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 22:38:51 2017", "ups": 9}, {"body": "Never.

I support that based on the people I've observed who own large volumes of firearms and fight most ardently for the unrestricted right to own and openly bare firearms. I would like firearms to be for hunting only, unless you served in the Military, at which point you could own a semi-automatic rifle. I haven't seen the increase in the number of firearms providing more guns to more people, instead I have been informed that more guns are falling into the hands of the Same people. That to me shows, that more gun availability will not prevent crime, as the same people who already Have the guns, will just get more, rather than everyone in the country suddenly carrying. An armed populace with no training is more dangerous in my eyes, than an unarmed populace. Not to mention, I see guns becoming the primary things robbers Steal these days (Again, based on the news reports I hear locally). So... hell of a lot of good that gun is doing you, if someone can steal it from you.I believe Australia had a buyback program for guns, where they purchased the firearms from the owners.I don't know why an enterprising young criminal wouldn't sell his weapons back at that point. Again, they are already stealing a load of them. I mean, the thing here is really supply. America supplies arms to Mexico. Mexican drug cartels buy their guns in the US through intermediaries. So, by taking out the primary source of arms, it makes it more difficult for the criminals to get said guns too. So, if the US were to remove the ability to own these firearms, it'd deal a serious blow to the supply not only nationally, but internationally as well.And again, I just Don't buy that having guns prevents crime.

This is the 'collective rights' interpretation - which was the standard until it was repudiated by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). Other people feel that the Amendment principally acknowledges an 'individual right' to bear arms for any reason, or no reason at all, which was the gist of that SC ruling. If Madison were drafting the Second Amendment today, he definitely wouldn't mention militias. And he would probably use more careful language considering the advancement of weapons in the last 200+ years.

I'm guessing you meant a 250 mA power supply.Now it's just unit conversions. 3000 mAh / 250 mA = 12 hours.So you were mostly right.If 12 hours seems impractically long, you can charge at a higher amperage. To determine the maximum safe charging current, some batteries will include a \"c rating.\" The maximum charging current will be equal to the charge of the battery times the c rating.

Current is completely dependent on the voltage so it's not like you can just say charge it at 250mA as there is only 1 voltage that will be supplied at with any given load(and as the battery charges this voltage is continuously increasing as well to maintain that charge rate). If the voltage is lower than this point you will get less charge current and if the voltage is higher you will get a higher current(assuming the charger is capable of it). Lets say you have a mostly dead li-ion battery, it may read 3v or 3.2v. If it is a 250mA charger then the voltage the charger has to put out to dump that much current into it would only be around 0.1v higher than the battery at any given time throughout the charge. The higher the charge current is the higher this voltage difference will be. This trend continues all the way until the battery reaches a certain voltage(probably around 4V) at which point the charger will put out a constant 4.2V and the charge current will get drastically reduced until the battery reaches that same voltage and no more current will flow into the battery. This reason is why getting proper battery chargers is so important they do all the fancy stuff for you.you can't just hook up 4.2V to a li-ion battery though. If you attempted to do that with a flat battery it will draw excessive current and may catch on fire. Eventually the charger will put out that voltage to charge the battery but depending how dead the battery is will depend on what voltage it gets charged at.  To answer your question though, it could take longer or shorter depending on a few factors. A battery may have a capacity of 3000mAh but almost no device actually fully discharges batteries. so what you consider a dead battery may have only used up 2500mAh and only that capacity is what will need to be recharged so it could take less time. However it could also take longer due to the fact it doesn't supply that charge current from 0%-100%. if it did then it would be close but the last bit of capacity will be charged at a much lower charge current so while 90% may get done in 10.8 hours the last 10% would take longer than the expected 1.2 hours. This is the reason you see marketing saying thing like 80% charge in 30 minutes or whatever other phrasing they use in those quick charge advertisements. It's better than saying 100% in 1 hour, to most people that 80% in half the total charge time is far more important than the top 20% which may extend charge time by double.

I'm guessing you meant a 250 mA power supply.Now it's just unit conversions. 3000 mAh / 250 mA = 12 hours.So you were mostly right.If 12 hours seems impractically long, you can charge at a higher amperage. To determine the maximum safe charging current, some batteries will include a \"c rating.\" The maximum charging current will be equal to the charge of the battery times the c rating.

Current is completely dependent on the voltage so it's not like you can just say charge it at 250mA as there is only 1 voltage that will be supplied at with any given load(and as the battery charges this voltage is continuously increasing as well to maintain that charge rate). If the voltage is lower than this point you will get less charge current and if the voltage is higher you will get a higher current(assuming the charger is capable of it). Lets say you have a mostly dead li-ion battery, it may read 3v or 3.2v. If it is a 250mA charger then the voltage the charger has to put out to dump that much current into it would only be around 0.1v higher than the battery at any given time throughout the charge. The higher the charge current is the higher this voltage difference will be. This trend continues all the way until the battery reaches a certain voltage(probably around 4V) at which point the charger will put out a constant 4.2V and the charge current will get drastically reduced until the battery reaches that same voltage and no more current will flow into the battery. This reason is why getting proper battery chargers is so important they do all the fancy stuff for you.you can't just hook up 4.2V to a li-ion battery though. If you attempted to do that with a flat battery it will draw excessive current and may catch on fire. Eventually the charger will put out that voltage to charge the battery but depending how dead the battery is will depend on what voltage it gets charged at.  To answer your question though, it could take longer or shorter depending on a few factors. A battery may have a capacity of 3000mAh but almost no device actually fully discharges batteries. so what you consider a dead battery may have only used up 2500mAh and only that capacity is what will need to be recharged so it could take less time. However it could also take longer due to the fact it doesn't supply that charge current from 0%-100%. if it did then it would be close but the last bit of capacity will be charged at a much lower charge current so while 90% may get done in 10.8 hours the last 10% would take longer than the expected 1.2 hours. This is the reason you see marketing saying thing like 80% charge in 30 minutes or whatever other phrasing they use in those quick charge advertisements. It's better than saying 100% in 1 hour, to most people that 80% in half the total charge time is far more important than the top 20% which may extend charge time by double.

The proper and accurate term is \u201csuppressor\u201d because they diminish, but do not eliminate, the sound of gunfire. Suppressors do not function well on automatic weapons. They tend to melt or malfunction under the intense heat of automatic fire. For this reason, there are only a few companies that even manufacture them for use on automatic weapons. And there is almost no marketplace for them. The law on suppressors is already strong. Pursuant to federal law, a person has to have a permit to own or possess one and only after undergoing a criminal background check. Violation of the law is a felony punishable by up to ten years in prison. If it is used during the course of a crime, the penalty is enhanced to 30 years. Illegal use of suppressors in murder cases is exceedingly rare. According to a study by Paul A. Clark in the Western Criminology Review, there were only two federal murder cases using a suppressor during a ten-year period of time (1995 to 2005). Both involved handguns. One of the suppressors was homemade. Clark concluded that the illegal use of suppressors to commit murder is so miniscule that a ban on the devices is \u201cunlikely to have any effect on crime\u201d.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 15, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 18:55:06 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "That's a lie.

This was a definition of feminism I offered in Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center more than 10 years ago. It was my hope at the time that it would become a common definition everyone would use. I liked this definition because it did not imply that men were the enemy. By naming sexism as the problem it went directly to the heart of the matter. Practically, it is a definition which implies that all sexist thinking and action is the problem, whether those who perpetuate it are female or male, child or adult. It is also broad enough to include an understanding of systemic institutionalized sexism. As a definition it is open-ended. To understand feminism it implies one has to necessarily understand sexism.As all advocates of feminist politics know, most people do not understand sexism, or if they do, they think it is not a problem. Masses of people think that feminism is always and only about women seeking to be equal to men. And a huge majority of these folks think feminism is anti-male. Their misunderstanding of feminist politics reflects the reality that most folks learn about feminism from patriarchal mass media. The feminism they hear about the most is portrayed by women who are primarily committed to gender equality - equal pay for equal work, and sometimes women and men sharing household chores and parenting. They see that these women are usually white and materially privileged. They know from mass media that women\u2019s liberation focuses on the freedom to have abortions, to be lesbians, to challenge rape and domestic violence.Among these issues, masses of people agree with the idea of gender equity in the workplace - equal pay for equal work.Since our society continues to be primarily a \u201cChristian\u201d culture, masses of people continue to believe that god has ordained that women be subordinate to men in the domestic household. Even though masses of women have entered the workforce, even though many families are headed by women who are the sole breadwinners, the vision of domestic life which continues to dominate the nation\u2019s imagination is one in which the logic of male domination is intact, whether men are present in the home or not. The wrong minded notion of feminist movement which implied it was anti-male carried with it the wrong-minded assumption that all female space would necessarily be an environment where patriarchy and sexist thinking would be absent. Many women, even those involved in feminist politics, chose to believe this as well.There was indeed a great deal of anti-male sentiment among early feminist activists who were responding to male domination with anger. It was that anger at injustice that was the impetus for creating a women\u2019s liberation movement. Early on most feminist activists (a majority of whom were white) had their consciousness raised about the nature of male domination when they were working in anti-classist and anti-racist settings with men who were telling the world about the importance of freedom while subordinating the women in their ranks. Whether it was white women working on behalf of socialism, black women working on behalf of civil rights and black liberation, or Native American women working for indigenous rights, it was clear that men wanted to lead, and they wanted women to follow. Participating in these radical freedom struggles awakened the spirit of rebellion and resistance in progressive females and led them towards contemporary women\u2019s liberation.As contemporary feminism progressed, as women realized that males were not the only group in our society who supported sexist thinking and behavior - that females could be sexist as well - anti-male sentiment no longer shaped the movement\u2019s consciousness. The focus shifted to an all-out effort to create gender justice. But women could not band together to further feminism without confronting our sexist thinking. Sisterhood could not be powerful as long as women were competitively at war with one another. Utopian visions of sisterhood based solely on the awareness of the reality that all women were in some way victimized by male domination were disrupted by discussions of class and race. Discussions of class differences occurred early on in contemporary feminism, preceding discussions of race. Diana Press published revolutionary insights about class divisions between women as early as the mid-\u201870s in their collection of essays Class and Feminism. These discussions did not trivialize the feminist insistence that \u201csisterhood is powerful,\u201d they simply emphasized that we could only become sisters in struggle by confronting the ways women - through sex, class, and race - dominated and exploited other women, and created a political platform that would address these differences.Even though individual black women were active in contemporary feminist movement from its inception, they were not the individuals who became the \u201cstars\u201d of the movement, who attracted the attention of mass media. Often individual black women active in feminist movement were revolutionary feminists (like many white lesbians). They were already at odds with reformist feminists who resolutely wanted to project a vision of the movement as being solely about women gaining equality with men in the existing system. Even before race became a talked about issue in feminist circles it was clear to black women (and to their revolutionary allies in struggle) that they were never going to have equality within the existing white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.From its earliest inception feminist movement was polarized. Reformist thinkers chose to emphasize gender equality. Revolutionary thinkers did not want simply to alter the existing system so that women would have more rights. We wanted to transform that system, to bring an end to patriarchy and sexism. Since patriarchal mass media was not interested in the more revolutionary vision, it never received attention in mainstream press. The vision of \u201cwomen\u2019s liberation\u201d which captured and still holds the public imagination was the one representing women as wanting what men had. And this was the vision that was easier to realize. Changes in our nation\u2019s economy, economic repression, the loss of jobs, etc., made the climate ripe for our nation\u2019s citizens to accept the notion of gender equality in the workforce.Given the reality of racism, it made sense that white men were more willing to consider women\u2019s rights when the granting of those rights could serve the interests of maintaining white supremacy.We can never forget that white women began to assert their need for freedom after civil rights, just at the point when racial discrimination was ending and black people, especially black males, might have attained equality in the workforce with white men. Reformist feminist thinking focusing primarily on equality with men in the workforce overshadowed the original radical foundations of contemporary feminism which called for reform as well as overall restructuring of society so that our nation would be fundamentally anti-sexist.Most women, especially privileged white women, ceased even to consider revolutionary feminist visions, once they began to gain economic power within the existing social structure. Ironically, revolutionary feminist thinking was most accepted and embraced in academic circles. In those circles the production of revolutionary feminist theory progressed, but more often than not that theory was not made available to the public. It became and remains a privileged discourse available to those among us who are highly literate, well-educated, and usually materially privileged. Works like Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center that offer a liberatory vision of feminist transformation never receive mainstream attention. Masses of people have not heard of this book. They have not rejected its message; they do not know what the message is.While it was in the interest of mainstream white supremacist capitalist patriarchy to suppress visionary feminist thinking which was not anti-male or concerned with getting women the right to be like men, reformist feminists were also eager to silence these forces. Reformist feminism became their route to class mobility. They could break free of male domination in the workforce and be more self-determining in their lifestyles. While sexism did not end, they could maximize their freedom within the existing system. And they could count on there being a lower class of exploited subordinated women to do the dirty work they were refusing to do. By accepting and indeed colluding with the subordination of working-class and poor women, they not only ally themselves with the existing patriarchy and its concomitant sexism, they give themselves the right to lead a double life, one where they are the equals of men in the workforce and at home when they want to be. If they choose lesbianism they have the privilege of being equals with men in the workforce while using class power to create domestic lifestyles where they can choose to have little or no contact with men.Lifestyle feminism ushered in the notion that there could be as many versions of feminism as there were women. Suddenly the politics was being slowly removed from feminism. And the assumption prevailed that no matter what a woman\u2019s politics, be she conservative or liberal, she too could fit feminism into her existing lifestyle. Obviously this way of thinking has made feminism more acceptable because its underlying assumption is that women can be feminists without fundamentally challenging and changing themselves or the culture. For example, let\u2019s take the issue of abortion. If feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression, and depriving females of reproductive rights is a form of sexist oppression, then one cannot be anti-choice and be feminist. A woman can insist she would never choose to have an abortion while affirming her support of the right of women to choose and still be an advocate of feminist politics. She cannot be anti-abortion and an advocate of feminism. Concurrently there can be no such thing as \u201cpower feminism\u201d if the vision of power evoked is power gained through the exploitation and oppression of others.Feminist politics is losing momentum because feminist movement has lost clear definitions. We have those definitions. Let\u2019s reclaim them. Let\u2019s share them. Let\u2019s start over. Let\u2019s have T-shirts and bumper stickers and postcards and hip-hop music, television and radio commercials, ads everywhere and billboards, and all manner of printed material that tells the world about feminism. We can share the simple yet powerful message that feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression. Let\u2019s start there. Let the movement begin again.\"", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "74ekcz", "gilded": 0, "stickied": true, "title": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 2: \"Feminist politics - where we stand\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000)", "num_comments": 1, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 692, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/74ekcz/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_2_feminist_politics/", "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 12:07:48 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "**[Part 1 - Come closer to feminism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/73yq84/hooked_on_bell_hooks_come_closer_to_feminism_from/)**", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 23, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 12:09:11 2017", "ups": 2}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74ekcz/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_2_feminist_politics/", "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "Valid point.

You need a diet and lifestyle you can sustain forever.  What you did back then doesn't work, and what you're doing now isn't working either.Now isn't quite the time to be counting calories. But you can change what you eat.For instance you can cut frosting out of your diet, and start doing an hour long walk every day. I know you said:> I can't work out. I mean, physically I can but I become an emotional wreck when I do.Would this apply to a literal walk in the park too?Could you go the rest of your life without frosting and with taking a walk each day?

It is never normal or okay to force yourself to throw up after eating. The fact that you are not ultra skinny, or that your life isn't completely consumed by this, doesn't mean you don't/can't have an eating disorder. Please take this seriously starting now, because it can take over your life VERY quickly.The shame that you feel is normal, despite the fact that you have nothing to be ashamed of. You're manifesting stress and insecurity in a way that few people understand, and most people will not have ideal reactions. **You don't need to tell anyone you don't want to.**The problem is not your weight. THE PROBLEM IS NOT YOUR WEIGHT. You should seek therapy if possible, or utilize the vast network of tips, support, and coping strategies for eating disorders, body issues, and compulsive eating that the internet has to offer. You don't have a problem with food. You have a problem with self esteem and body image, and **you can absolutely grow out of this and be healthy and happy.**You aren't going to get throat cancer from occasional purging. You will, however, damage your teeth. If you find yourself having purged, rinse your mouth out with water and baking soda. This neutralizes the stomach acid in your mouth. Brushing your teeth while you still have a lot of acid in your mouth can do more damage.I really hope that you never, ever purge again. It's 100% possible.

I have never been in a relationship.Looking for love has me more and more frustrated every day. I haven't the slightest clue how to meet guys who aren't only interested in sex. I'm not a virgin, but the few times I've had sex have been one-night-stand type scenarios that have left me feeling empty and completely awful. I would love to meet someone who wouldn't mind waiting at least a few weeks to go all the way so we can really get to know each other first and decide that we like each other. That attitude is considered laughable and prude among people of my generation who are mostly very sex-liberated. I have SUCH a hard time meeting guys. I went to half a dozen club meetings at my university and I swear, ALL the guys I met were gay. Literally every guy I've talked to since I've come to this school has been gay. I have no problem with gay people whatsoever but I obviously can't date them so it doesn't help my current problem. Most of my closest friends are gay as well (guys and girls) and they tend to hang with other LGBTQ+ folk, which again is totally fine and great but I can't meet people to date through them. I'm really interested in music and go to a lot of concerts, sometimes by myself, but I have this insanely paranoid fear that if I try to strike up a conversation with a guy at a show he'll immediately think I'm trying to have sex with him. Because why else would a girl approach a guy alone, right?! Tinder is totally useless, I get my fair share of matches but I always stop replying to guys after they ask me out on a date because I'm worried they will expect sex at the end and don't know how to reject that beforehand without making it really weird. Obviously the feminist in me says \"you don't owe guys anything, they have to respect you\" but in practice it's SO hard to disappoint a guy like that so I just don't even bother meeting them in the first place. Also most guys are only on Tinder for sex which is great for them but it means the app is useless for me. Every single relationship I know of in my life--all 3 of my roommates, a good dozen of my friends--started on Tinder, so no one has any advice for me for how to meet guys besides using that stupid fucking app.And then of course there's the age-old adage \"once you stop looking for it, it will find you.\" Yes, I know I need to stop obsessing about it if I want it to actually happen but at the same time I know I won't get anywhere if I don't put myself out there and make an effort to meet people. It's just so hard because my sex drive is so low and most guys my age don't want to bother getting to know a girl before getting in her pants.I feel like there's a lot I'm forgetting to say here but you get the gist.

We were drinking and started having sex but then stopped before we finished. He suggested we go to his place since mine was a mess due to an upcoming move. I blacked out on the drive over there. I remember a bathroom, maybe seeing one of his roommates, and lying on his couch watching something. I remember drinking shitty beer. &nbsp;I woke up on the sidewalk in his neighborhood to a man calling the police. An ambulance and two police officers came. They kept asking me what happened to my eye but I didn't know what they were talking about. I had two large black eyes, a severe bruise on the side of my face, small bruises all over my body but not really in a consistent way that would let me know what happened. There was also a small bruise on the bridge of my nose so I either fell on my face or someone hit me. I was missing my purse and my shoes. &nbsp;When I was discharged from the hospital I emailed the guy I was hanging out with and asked what happened. I had a sinking feeling that I had done something embarrassing but didn't, and still don't, remember anything. He said that I \"freaked the fuck out\" and knocked over all the stuff on his coffee table and kicked a hole in his roommate's expensive amp or speaker or whatever. This does not sound like me at all, at least drunk me. I asked him if he had my bag and he said he found it on the side of his house and would bring it to me but then I didn't hear from him again. &nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, this kinda got away from me because all I really want to know is if it's possible to be raped and not know it. I don't feel like I was but everyone seems to assume that it MUST have happened because, you know, I'm a girl and I was with a guy. But I've had consensual sex and been sore the next day so the absence of that makes me think nothing inappropriate happened. Also, I did have a feeling of doing something embarrassing the night before, despite not remembering, but I didn't have a feeling that I had had sex. Is it certain that I would have known?&nbsp;**TLDR**; I got drunk and blacked out while hanging out with a guy, I woke up on the sidewalk with a lot of bruising but it was all over my body, not necessarily near my genitals. I still don't remember anything from that night. I wasn't sore and didn't feel like I was raped but everyone is telling me that that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

I'm starting to freak out because I've been waiting days for it to start now. All I have are moderate cramps throughout the day. No spotting. Nothing. BF and I had sex once a few weeks ago. Condom didn't break everything was fine. Then we tried to have sex about 2-3 days before I thought my period was gonna start, as soon as he put it in the condom broke. He took it out immediately. I don't know how likely this makes it that I could be pregnant as all that could've been inside me was precum, which I've heard is mostly dead semen anyway and he hadnt cum prior to that. Like I said, he took it out immediately after putting it in and we stopped. I also wasn't fertile at that point in the cycle because it was so close to my period. I just don't know. This has never happened to me before and I can't stop ruminating on it, which is probably making it worse because the stress hormones or whatever are causing it to be even later. I've been really stressed out about my period coming since the condom broke, like unbearably stressed so maybe that's just caused it to be late or not come...? I FEEL like it's gonna come, like I've had all the regular PMS symptoms and I have the cramps, it's just nothing's happening. My sleeping schedule has also been really off and different since the semester started, which I heard could set your period a little off balance. Basically I haven't been getting much sleep.Other than that I dunno. I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. Can anyone just please help me calm down?

Yesterday I was sexually harrased, not for the first time but I remember what I was thinking the whole time and I know that my thoughts are the thoughts of many women in the same situation - I want to share them, because they are wrong.It happened in the train. It was quite full but not as crowded as it could be. The seat near me was free and I was in one of those trains that don't have arm pillows between the seats. So a guy asked if he could sit next to me, he was really strange, only whispered but what ever... I don't want to judge people so easily. So it was a three people seat, I was at the right seat next to the window, another woman was at the left side so this guy sat in the middle. I noticed right away that he was really close, so close that his whole side touched me and his elbow was on my knee. I'm extremely anxious when it comes to body contact with strangers, I need my personal space or I will panic. So there was this guy nearly sitting on top of me and I was horrified.I thought that it was just me overreacting. It's a full train, right? There's probably just not enough space for him. For everyone else this wouldn't be uncomfortable, it's probably just me. So I didn't said anything. I texted a friend to calm down but I coud barely move my hands, this guy was so close that he pressed me against the window and I was pretty much unable to move. I tried to give him a little push with my elbow just hard enough for him to notice that I felt uncomfortable, so that he could eventually make himself a little smaller. Nothing. I pushed a second time, clearly struggling in my situation. Nothing. Instead I felt like he was even coming closer, pushing my purse away with his elbow to make space for his arm. I tried to make eye contact with him so that I could tell him to leave me some space and this is when I saw it. There was more than enough space, between him and the other woman were around 10 cm free space! There was absolutely no reason for him to be this close.But I was still thinking, what if he doesn't notice how close he is to me? Maybe the body contact doesn't feel as intense to me since he isn't pressed against a window like me. I said nothing, I felt sick, weak, I knew that it wasn't right but a small part in me still told me that I was overreacting, that it would be impolite to say something, so I didn't. That was the moment I felt his hand at my upper inner leg. I was mortified, as said I can't endure body contact and there was this stranger inviding my personal space. I couldn't do anything, my mind was just blank for a few minutes. I thought about it, it could be a coincidence that he was this close, it could be a coincidence that his elbow touched my leg, it could be a coincidence that his arm followed, it could be a coincidence that his hand was on my leg when his arm already was there before but there was from the beginning enough space for him to not touch me, I gave him clear signals of discomfort which he ignored and there is NO WAY that in a situation that starts with enough soace to not touch another person his hand landed on my inner leg! At the time I was ready to stand up to him the train arrived, so in the end I did nothing. I felt sick for the rest of the day and all I could think of was, that I let this guy do what he wanted and that I gave him comfort in the fact that no woman will stand up to him. He will do it again and hopefully the next woman won't belive in coincidence.Please if you have to ask yourself if it is coincidence or not - it's most certainly not. It's easy to think that in a hypothetical situation we would react right and stand up to the guy but when it happens my thought will maybe be yours. If you think that you're overreacting and if you are afraid of being impolite...Ask yourself the following questions 1. Did you gave him a signal that you're feeling uncomfortable about the situation wich he ignored? Normal people will notice and will react. Also people who sexually harras others know that what they are doing is potentially illegal. They wont just grab you by the pussy or slap your ass. They will make small movements, a short touch with their hand at your butt in a bus, being too close at a train and touching you slowly... They want you to think that it was a coincidence so ask yourself the following as well2. Ignoring all the little steps in between, is it possible that the situation starting at point A resultet in the new present situation B?And the last thing is, we can't always be all that strong woman that screams at the pervert. We would like to be but if you can't, if your mind still tells you to not be impolite there are other options.Just ask the person to give you some space, if it was a coincidence the other person will be more than happy to respect your wish and care better, if he was harrassing you he most certainly will move away too and let you alone. Why? Because guys harassing womans have small balls and will panic at the sight of confrontation. I should have done this but at the time I thought about this it was already too late for me. Don't let it be too late for you.Thanks for reading, English isn't my first language and I wrote this from my mobile so please excuse any typos, and spelling-/grammar errors. Take care.

Bear with me.I told myself I\u2019d wait until I was financially sound enough to date, to marry, and to have children.That was when I was 20 and only had Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and other minor crap to deal with.I finally finished college at 28. I haven\u2019t been able to stay awake at a full-time job or wake up on my own consistently since age 22, but I was optimistic I would never have to go on disability. Thanks to my stupid pride, I didn\u2019t even bother to apply until this year, though when I graduated without a full-time income I did have to go on Medicaid.Now I\u2019m 36. I have debts, no savings because before Obamacare I was only allowed to make $215/month or lose my health insurance, and my pills cost 20k+/year OOP. My parents have supported me. I still live in their house.I try not to hate myself.My medical conditions include:\u00b7 narcolepsy with cataplexy (I take Provigil and Zoloft)\u00b7 PCOS (I gave up on taking anything for this, Invositol didn\u2019t work, BC just stopped my periods)\u00b7 severe arthritis in both knees (euflexxa shots, cortisone shots)\u00b7 an undiagnosed stomach problem, probably IBS & chronic constipation (I\u2019m running out of meds to try but am still on pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor)\u00b7 OCD\u00b7 hoardingWhile I have some good memories among the bad, this is not how I pictured my life turning out. My fellow Ivy League graduates are either out saving the world, making six figure salaries, or inventing the next Facebook.  My friends are all married or in relationships, many with children, some with teenagers. They all have careers of their own and live independently.I am freelancing and flipping stuff on Craigslist. Part-time. From my parents\u2019 basement. I\u2019ve had one serious relationship since high school.I want to marry. I want to act part-time. I want biological children.None of my health problems are curable, and I\u2019m not getting any younger. I have to at least plan for the possibility that I will never have enough energy to work productively enough to make a sustainable income that will keep me out of poverty.While I don\u2019t want to wait to find love or be wealthier, I can if I have to. However, there is no longer the luxury of putting off family planning to lose weight, make a fortune, start dating again, etc. first. There is no time left to fix my life. I have to start saving and taking fertility tests now, even if I can\u2019t afford to do anything yet.I highly doubt that many women in the exact same situation as me are going to see this, but if you have experience dealing with one or more of these issues, including not being able to take care of yourself if you have to go off your meds while pregnant, I\u2019d appreciate advice on how and what to start doing to save for fertility treatments, which work better with PCOS and/or narcolepsy, if you were ever able to wean yourself off of PPIs, etc. Also, what kind of plans and contingencies to prepare.Also, what kind of fertility treatments are more affordable for a high risk pregnancy? The safest bet would be surrogacy, but that\u2019s the most expensive and I don\u2019t know any friends or family who would be willing or able to be a surrogate.I have no idea if egg donation banks even want to try an extract eggs when the woman has cysts. I\u2019d be willing to donate some of my eggs if I had enough to spare, though whether anyone would want them is another question entirely.[I\u2019m not adopting or fostering unless at least three doctors tell me all of my eggs are dead and every bioengineering lab I can find refuses to insert my chromosomes into different eggs. I have as much right as anyone else to have biological children, so as a favor to me, please don\u2019t offer those suggestions. Thank you.]Then there are the drugs you take to help you become pregnant. Then which treatment? IUI? IVF? Beg a friend to be the baby daddy?As to carrying the baby myself: If I were to go off the provigil and zoloft, I would have to have a live-in caretaker while I was pregnant. I would sleep until my teeth rotted and I developed bladder infections. The last time I tried going off Provigil, I slept about 23 hours a day.The last time I tried weaning myself of of zoloft to try a different SSRI that would treat the cataplexy, I was suicidal.(Let me tell you, knowing it\u2019s just the medication but still having your brain telling you that you want to die is scary as hell. You can tell yourself logically that literally NOTHING has changed but the dose of drug going into your body, but the chemical receptors in your brain override everything else.)Should I plan for one or two or all options? I have no idea if Medicaid even covers basic fertility tests.I have no idea where to start and my friends don\u2019t have any idea what it\u2019s like to even have to consider this.

Things were going great until about month 5 or so, when Alex started getting busier and busier with his demanding work schedule. I kept trying to make plans, he kept putting them off, citing his crazy difficult work projects as an excuse. I hadn't seen him for a month, but he finally found the time for me last Monday night. We hung out, but it was....weird. Awkward. I felt uncomfortable around him and was wishing I just stayed home the whole night.    I sensed things were off, so I asked him if we could have a conversation about something serious. It was late and he told me he was too tired to talk, and we could talk about it later. We went to bed. On Wednesday we finally had the dreaded conversation. I asked things like \"What are we?\" and \"do you think we have a future together?\". Valid questions, I think, to ask someone when you've been \"together\" for 6 months. He told me he was too busy and not ready for a relationship, but he was also confused about his feelings so he asked for a day to think things over. I gave it to him.He called me on Thursday to end things. I was crushed, but at the same time I had also seen this coming so I was prepared, and also a little relieved, considering how shitty the past month of our \"relationship\" had been. It's Friday, so I figure I'm gonna stop pitying myself and hang out with one of my best friends, Dan. He just moved into a new place with his roommate, Brandon. They have a hot tub, so I was excited to relax, have a couple beers, and try to forget about things. Dan went to bed, and I found myself hanging out alone with Brandon. We had an amazing time, I was cracking up laughing for hours, we stayed up until like 5 am. I slept with Brandon, the sex was amazing!! I feel like I connected more with Brandon in 6 hours than I had with Alex in 6 months. I was questioning why I even dated Alex in the first place.I'm not sure if I regret the night with Brandon. I was single for literally less than 24 hours and had already slept with someone new. I was raised pretty conservative, so obviously I'm a slut, right? But I was technically single so does that make things ok? To make things worse, Brandon and Alex are friends. Should I feel guilty about how Alex is going to feel when he finds out?To be clear, I didn't do this out of revenge. I still think Alex is a good person and I don't want to hurt him. I just genuinely felt a connection to Brandon and impulsively acted on it. Brandon and I are still texting, should I pursue this? Or should I just cut contact and swear off men for a while until I figure my shit out? If anyone actually takes the time to read this, thank you so much. Everything feels like such a mess right now and I could use some different perspectives.Also, I'm a 25 year old female if that is important.

I asked my friend why ( could they not handle the physical demands?)The reply was interesting. \"Diet, and attitude.\"The hispanics will usually have  a decent breakfast and lunch, while locals will have maybe a couple of donuts, or a ham biscuit, etc.Said friend must compete in a marketplace on price and contracts, or go out of business whether anyone likes the situation or not.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 12022, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 20:08:38 2017", "ups": 1}], "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-landscapers-hire-american-plan-ended-with-bringing-in-mexican-workers-to-finish-the-job/2017/10/05/f4656234-9743-11e7-b569-3360011663b4_story.html?utm_term=.6504aa9c8f72", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "green": 0.2940334976}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": 0.1945706755, "top_comments": [{"body": "\u201cRussian investigators have raided the homes of at least five people working for an exiled oligarch, in connection with a decades-old dispute over what was once the country\u2019s largest oil producer.In a statement, the Investigative Committee said that the Thursday morning raid relates to a 2003 criminal case involving the Yukos oil company, which was disbanded four years later after filing for bankruptcy.Its owner and head Mikhail Khodorkovsky was sent to prison in what was largely seen as the Kremlin\u2019s payback for his political ambitions.

So U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which had Lopez-Sanchez in its custody in March after his release from federal prison, turned him over to San Francisco deputies.

But San Francisco is a city that doesn't honor such requests and the sheriff's department released him. Freya Horne, chief legal counsel to the San Francisco County Sheriff, told CNN that he was let go because there was no legal cause to detain the suspect.   http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/03/us/san-francisco-killing-suspect-immigrant-deported/index.html", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 35405, "stickied": false, "score": 76, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 23:58:02 2017", "ups": 76}, {"body": "No way this is going to backfire.
