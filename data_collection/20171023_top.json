While working in Moscow I learned that Russian oligarchs stole from shareholders, which included the fund I advised. Consequently, I had an interest in fighting this endemic corruption, so my firm started doing detailed research on exactly how the oligarchs stole the vast amounts of money that they did. When we were finished with our research we would share it with the domestic and international media.> > For a time, this naming and shaming campaign worked remarkably well and led to less corruption and increased share prices in the companies we invested in. Why? Because President Vladimir Putin and I shared the same set of enemies. When Putin was first elected in 2000, he found that the oligarchs had misappropriated much of the president\u2019s power as well. They stole power from him while stealing money from my investors. In Russia, your enemy\u2019s enemy is your friend, and even though I\u2019ve never met Putin, he would often step into my battles with the oligarchs and crack down on them.> > That all changed in July 2003, when Putin arrested Russia\u2019s biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin grabbed Khodorkovsky off his private jet, took him back to Moscow, put him on trial, and allowed television cameras to film Khodorkovsky sitting in a cage right in the middle of the courtroom. That image was extremely powerful, because none of the other oligarchs wanted to be in the same position. **After Khodorkovsky\u2019s conviction, the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky. From what followed, it appeared that Putin\u2019s answer was, \u201cFifty percent.\u201d He wasn\u2019t saying 50 percent for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50 percent for Vladimir Putin personally. From that moment on, Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world, and my anti-corruption activities would no longer be tolerated.**> > The results of this change came very quickly. On November 13, 2005, as I was flying into Moscow from a weekend away, I was stopped at Sheremetyevo airport, detained for 15 hours, deported, and declared a threat to national security.[More background.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/782ri5/why_is_bill_browder_banned_from_america/doqty4o/)Other threads from today: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/787bd4/state_department_reportedly_revokes_visit_of/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/787nkb/state_dept_revokes_visa_of_top_putin_critic_report/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/787vv6/trump_officials_suddenly_revoke_visa_of_hero/).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 24079, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 22:07:33 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Possibly because Browder got added to an Interpol list of \"wanted people\" (At Russia's *repeated* request) which could trigger an automated system to revoke a visa.>\"Contacts in Congress made enquiries with Homeland Security and said it had been cancelled due to a flag by foreign law enforcement.\"^ From an Intercept piece about it.

This bump can irritate the Achilles tendon over time (the Achilles tendon is formed by both the *gastrocnemius* and the *soleus* tendons), and damage it.  The tendon can degenerate, or even rupture.  But a damaged Achilles tendon can be repaired, either by using sutures, by reattachment, or by moving a tendon from another part of the body to replace the damaged part.  They can even do a tendon lengthening if the Achilles is too tight (a *gastrocnemius recession* aka the *Strayer Procedure* or the *modified Strayer*, depending on the exact problem).  Gastrocs/Strayers are usually performed to correct an *equinus deformity* in adults, in which the gastroc tendon (because it is the larger tendon) is pulled tight and, as a result, the foot cannot be placed flat on the floor, and probably has very little dorsi/plantar flexion (up and down movement).  But rest assured, a damaged Achilles tendon does not mean you will be crippled for life!    :)Podiatry is very complicated - truly a specialty unto itself and so very fascinating - and there are too many problems and procedures to list here.  I can't begin to explain them all.  Many times, though, a Patient has more than one foot problem, as they tend to mesh into one another - one issue begets another, etc.  The most procedures I ever scheduled for one person's foot was eight.  Eight *separate* procedures for one foot, all to be performed on the same day.  At that point, just go get yourself a new foot!   :)With Trump, however, no one has ever specified exactly *where* his 'bone spurs' were.  You can have bone spurs anywhere that joints rub, and you can also develop them on the bottom of the calcaneal bone (they tend to be hook-shaped ), but those can be easily removed. Trump might have had *plantar fasciitis*, which is nothing more than an irritation of the *plantar fascia*, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot from the heel to the toes. It seems very strange that he was granted so many deferments over something so easily corrected, but I guess money talks.  I really think it just boils down to the fact that Trump is a pussy.Source: I am a surgery scheduler, currently working in an Ortho Clinic at a children's hospital but I have done adult Ortho as well.TL;DR:  Explanation of some types of bone spur issues, and also Trump is a pussy", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 419, "stickied": false, "score": 57, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 08:57:12 2017", "ups": 57}, {"body": ">\"I've faced greater challenged than this,\" McCain shot back.Hehe.

But rest assured, a damaged Achilles tendon does not mean you will be crippled for life!    :)Podiatry is very complicated - truly a specialty unto itself and so very fascinating - and there are too many problems and procedures to list here.  I can't begin to explain them all.  Many times, though, a Patient has more than one foot problem, as they tend to mesh into one another - one issue begets another, etc.  The most procedures I ever scheduled for one person's foot was eight.  Eight *separate* procedures for one foot, all to be performed on the same day.  At that point, just go get yourself a new foot!   :)With Trump, however, no one has ever specified exactly *where* his 'bone spurs' were.  You can have bone spurs anywhere that joints rub, and you can also develop them on the bottom of the calcaneal bone (they tend to be hook-shaped ), but those can be easily removed. Trump might have had *plantar fasciitis*, which is nothing more than an irritation of the *plantar fascia*, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot from the heel to the toes. It seems very strange that he was granted so many deferments over something so easily corrected, but I guess money talks.  I really think it just boils down to the fact that Trump is a pussy.Source: I am a surgery scheduler, currently working in an Ortho Clinic at a children's hospital but I have done adult Ortho as well.TL;DR:  Explanation of some types of bone spur issues, and also Trump is a pussy", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 419, "stickied": false, "score": 58, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 08:57:12 2017", "ups": 58}, {"body": "If you need to pass a psych evaluation and have at least an average IQ to vote, I don't think Trump would have gotten 1 vote!", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 63, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 15:24:29 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "John \"The Maverick\" McCain is only 50+ years late with his condemnation of this practice.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 15294, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 16:07:30 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "When you were drafted could you go into non combat frontlines roles like medic or something like that", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 12877, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 16:11:29 2017", "ups": 1}], "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/356648-mccain-takes-swipe-at-trumps-bone-spur-vietnam-deferment", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "green": 0.3443421423}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": 0.265222609, "top_comments": [{"body": "As a reminder, this subreddit [is for civil discussion.](/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil)In general, be courteous to others.

I'm not \"victim blaming\" or blindly support Trump here but, this is a problem with both Puerto Rico, and Federal law.An \"Incident\" (blanket term for both Natural and, Man-made disasters) is managed at the lowest possible level. So, If this was a disaster in your county, your county government would manage it, and ask your state government for help. Your state would then ask FEMA for help if it needed additional resources and funding. This is how the Law deams it to work and, how it usually works out best.It's part of the changes that came about after Katrina. It used to be that once the state asked for help, FEMA took a bigger leadership role. The main problem with that model is, FEMA personnel from other parts of the country are clueless about your community. They don't know what resources you have, their capabilities or, have working relationships with them. FEMA personnel also face a huge learning curve when dealing with the makeup of the the residents and the potential dangers of the local industries. It's the local cops, firefighters and emergency managers that know the critical needs of their communities and it's why that shift in leadership was made.http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/16/health/puerto-rico-hospital-ship/index.html>According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the official protocol is for patients in need to go to their nearest medical facility. If that facility is unable to provide care, a doctor there should contact the medical coordinating center in San Juan.>Someone there will then determine whether a patient needs to be transferred to a hospital on the island and which one. In some cases, a determination will be made to transfer a patient to the US Army Combat Support Hospital in Humacao, which has 44 beds and has been operational since Sunday. The remaining option is for patients to be transferred to the Comfort.>\"Only patients with critical needs requiring specialized care will be transferred to USNS Comfort,\" said Coast Guard Lt. David Connor in an email. He is working at the FEMA Joint Information Center in San Juan. >\"The disconnect or the apparent disconnect was in the communications flow,\" Rossell\u00f3 said.>He acknowledged that the system must get better.>\"I asked for a complete revision of that so that we can now start sending more patients over there,\" Rossell\u00f3 said.Puerto Rico, just as every other state and territory of the U.S., is required to have an Emergency Management agency or, task an existing agency (Dept. of Health, State Police equivalent, ect...) with the authority and the responsability, to plan and be able to function in a disaster such as this. It looks like PR's government is failing it's people as much as the Feds are.**TL;DR: The U.S. response could has been quicker, Americans are suffering but, Puerto Rico's government has dropped the ball it this case and, it's illegal for FEMA to come in and take over.**Edit: Thanks for the Gold!", "gilded": 2, "author_comment_karma": 118155, "stickied": false, "score": 2748, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 24 00:52:46 2017", "ups": 2748}, {"body": "\"Well, I've gotten very high marks for the hurricanes\"Motherfucker you're the goddamn president...

Should the tariff happens, there is going to be a sharp increase in demand for installers as developers rush projects out the door. They have a time limit as to how long they can reserve panels for, so they're going to do everything they can to use up all of the panels they bought at pre-tariff pricing.

In most nuclear exchange scenarios, an effective first strike is the best way to minimize causalities on your side. The first strike scenario becomes less effective against countries which have the nuclear triad (subs, bombers, ICBMs) because it's nearly impossible to hit the entire triad at once.  In the case of North Korea, they do not have a triad yet and it's still possible to use a first strike scenario an minimize causalities.   I understand that everyone here is thinking \"what about their conventional artillery pointed at Seoul?\"  The answer to that question is two-fold:  1. An effect first strike would have to take that into consideration.  It might be tactical strikes on the artillery line to cripple it as much as possible.  Just fly a shitload of bombers along the line and drop as many MOABs as possible.    2. The issue is primarily about a casualty count.  What is the casualty count of a thermonuclear weapon detonated on Seoul vs heavy artillery fire?  Which ever is less is a better scenario.    A tactical first strike seems like a very aggressive move and potentially illegal. Until you consider that North Korea has made many bellicose threats to annihilate their enemies, that North Korea is indeed a legal enemy (since we never really ended the Korean War), and that they've have given Japan a shot across the bow recently.    The Allies didn't win WW2 by being kinder and gentler to their enemies.  If you hold-back in warfare, you will lose.  You cannot go in half-assed.  The US/South Korea/Japan has to make a decision on North Korea.  The more the clock ticks away, the less options they have and the greater the potential casualty count is.

In most nuclear exchange scenarios, an effective first strike is the best way to minimize causalities on your side. The first strike scenario becomes less effective against countries which have the nuclear triad (subs, bombers, ICBMs) because it's nearly impossible to hit the entire triad at once.  In the case of North Korea, they do not have a triad yet and it's still possible to use a first strike scenario an minimize causalities.   I understand that everyone here is thinking \"what about their conventional artillery pointed at Seoul?\"  The answer to that question is two-fold:  1. An effect first strike would have to take that into consideration.  It might be tactical strikes on the artillery line to cripple it as much as possible.  Just fly a shitload of bombers along the line and drop as many MOABs as possible.    2. The issue is primarily about a casualty count.  What is the casualty count of a thermonuclear weapon detonated on Seoul vs heavy artillery fire?  Which ever is less is a better scenario.    A tactical first strike seems like a very aggressive move and potentially illegal. Until you consider that North Korea has made many bellicose threats to annihilate their enemies, that North Korea is indeed a legal enemy (since we never really ended the Korean War), and that they've have given Japan a shot across the bow recently.    The Allies didn't win WW2 by being kinder and gentler to their enemies.  If you hold-back in warfare, you will lose.  You cannot go in half-assed.  The US/South Korea/Japan has to make a decision on North Korea.  The more the clock ticks away, the less options they have and the greater the potential casualty count is.    Diplomacy is a better option...as long as it's working.  It's not working with North Korea.  Neither are sanctions.  A first strike scenario should absolutely be on the table.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 134398, "stickied": false, "score": 7, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 20:53:22 2017", "ups": 7}, {"body": "So the future of the world rests in the hands of Boris Johnson, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-Un.Is that project to send random people to Mars for the rest of their lives still running?

The D.E.A. said it had evidence in the form of night-vision video taken from a surveillance plane showing an \u201cexchange of gunfire\u201d between the two vessels after the larger boat collided with the canoe carrying the agents.>Now, for the first time, the three-hour video has been released to the public. It strongly suggests that the D.E.A.\u2019s account of crossfire in the May 2012 mission was not accurate. The release of the video, under a Freedom of Information Act request, follows\u00a0a scathing report published by the inspectors general of the departments of Justice and State\u00a0earlier this year that challenged the D.E.A.\u2019s version of events.>The video shows numerous flashes of light consistent with gunshots originating from the antidrug unit, according to Bruce Koenig, a forensic expert hired by ProPublica and The New York Times to analyze the images.>Mr. Koenig, who formerly was supervisor of the F.B.I.\u2019s forensic audio/video group, examined the video frame by frame and concluded that only one flash originates from the passenger boat. In Mr. Koenig\u2019s view, that flash could have been caused by a bullet striking the engine, which was later found to have a bullet hole. Infrared cameras detect heat and turn it into bright spots on video, so a muzzle flash from a gunshot and a spark from a bullet ricocheting off a metal surface can create similar flares.>The controversy over the actions of the agents has had an impact: As the D.E.A. braced for the May release of the inspectors general report on the episode, the agency disbanded the program that had run the interdiction operation, named the Foreign-deployed Advisory Support Teams, or FAST. The FAST program provided\u00a0military-style training to law enforcement officers in other countries\u00a0to counter drug traffickers.>The inspectors general report, which found no evidence to support the D.E.A.\u2019s account that its agents were fired upon, has also drawn attention from lawmakers.

Infrared cameras detect heat and turn it into bright spots on video, so a muzzle flash from a gunshot and a spark from a bullet ricocheting off a metal surface can create similar flares.>The controversy over the actions of the agents has had an impact: As the D.E.A. braced for the May release of the inspectors general report on the episode, the agency disbanded the program that had run the interdiction operation, named the Foreign-deployed Advisory Support Teams, or FAST. The FAST program provided\u00a0military-style training to law enforcement officers in other countries\u00a0to counter drug traffickers.>The inspectors general report, which found no evidence to support the D.E.A.\u2019s account that its agents were fired upon, has also drawn attention from lawmakers. A bipartisan group of four senators asserted that the D.E.A. and State Department \u201crepeatedly and knowingly misled members of Congress and congressional staff.\u201d>\u201cThe D.E.A. convinced themselves of a false version of events due to arrogance, false assumptions, and ignorance,\u201d said Tim Rieser, an aide to Sen. Patrick Leahy and one of the staff members who has spent years delving into the shooting. \u201cThey rushed to judgment and then stuck to their story.\u201d", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 659123, "stickied": false, "score": 43, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 21:07:45 2017", "ups": 43}, {"body": "The D.E.A. are one of the least trusted agencies in the states.

Also if an Emirati committed a heinous crime against  foreigner, he would serve the minimal amount of time or none at all thanks to \"wasta\" (connections). I'm just gonna repost from the other thread, I know a lot of people will be extremely butthurt and upset that they're seeing this enormous post again but I want people to know the dark side of Dubai. I lived in the sandpit for just under a year and most people have no idea how bad it is, and I want more people to know what the less fortunate experience there. What the migrant women experience there is what real oppression and real \"rape culture\" look like. The things that the locals get away with there are beyond your imagination: 4 Emirati men kidnapped an Ethiopian maid, gang-raped her twice in different locations, then ran her over with a car and then proceeded to stone her to death with large rocks which smashed her skull into pieces. After paying 200k dirhams ($50k) \"blood money\" in total (so around $12.5k each, a few months salary for an Emirati), they were released from prison. One of the attackers 13 years prior had raped and murdered a Pakistani little girl, but her father who was an imam forgave him.So just to be clear, 4 Emirati men, one of whom was already a known rapist and murderer, gang raped and then brutally murdered an Ethiopian housemaid, smashing her skull into pieces, and they were released after paying just over $10k each. Because in the UAE foreign victims are practically forced into accepting blood money by their lawyers (always Emirati), none of them received their sentence. This was the \"Al Dhaid murder\", I strongly insist people look it up because it's even worse than you think. Search \"Al Dhaid murder\" on google for a proper set of results on how serious it was, it's even more grotesque than you think. So basically, this disgusting crime is not as bad as just normal consensual sex because as we know, Emiratis can do no wrong.Here's a story of how a French 15 year old teenage boy \"Alex\" was gang-raped by 3 Emirati men and it turns out that they gave him HIV/AIDS. Anyway, before outcry from human rights groups, it was he, rather than the rapists, that was arrested and blamed. The boy was actually quite lucky his mother was well connected with the diplomatic circles otherwise like the vast majority of other cases he would have been jailed for being raped.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/world/middleeast/01dubai.htmlA doctor examined Alex the night of the rape, taking swabs of DNA for traces of the rapists\u2019 sperm. He did not take blood tests or examine Alex with a speculum. Then he cleared the room and told Alex: \u201cI know you\u2019re a homosexual. You can admit it to me. I can tell.\u201d Alex told his father in tears: \u201cI\u2019ve just been raped by three men, and he\u2019s saying I\u2019m a homosexual,\u201d according to interviews with both of them. The doctor, an Egyptian, wrote in his legal report that he had found no evidence of forced penetration, which Alex\u2019s family says is a false assessment that could hurt the case against the assailants.In early September, after the family learned about the older attacker\u2019s H.I.V. status and the French government lodged complaints with the United Arab Emirates authorities, the Dubai attorney general\u2019s office assigned a new prosecutor to the case. Only then were forensic tests performed to confirm that sperm from all three attackers had been found in Alex.Alex stayed in Dubai in order to testify against his attackers, and went back to school in September, despite suffering unsettling flashbacks. In early October, however, the family said, their lawyer warned Alex that he was in danger of facing charges of homosexuality and a prison term of one year.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/world/middleeast/01dubai.htmlThere was another case involving a French girl where an Emirati singer, Saoud Abou Sultan, lured the girl to his room, spiked her drink and gang-raped her with others while she was unconscious. She woke up in the middle of the desert found by a police officer and apparently she had bruises all over her stomach and private parts. Anyway the most shocking thing about this was that Saoud Abou Sultan, being an Emirati, was not convincted of rape but for \"consensual sex\". He did receive 6 months of jail time which is impressive for a local who usually get nothing, but it was only because of \"consensual sex\" not rape. How the fuck is spiking a girl's drink, gang-raping her and dumping her in the desert consensual\"? Is that worth 6 months in jail?Rape victims, usually maids, are arrested for \"seduction\" or \"extramarital sex\" in the UAE while the rapist Emiratis have impunity: https://news.vice.com/article/rape-victims-are-being-jailed-under-extramarital-sex-laws-in-the-uae One BBC article apparently showed a rape victim being chained up after revealing her rape: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/hundreds-of-women-prosecuted-for-extramarital-sex-in-uae-finds-bbc Apparently one Ethiopian servant who was raped was arrested and when they found she was pregnant, chained her to the hospital bed to prevent her from absconding from her crime of being raped.Another recent story in the UAE where an Emirati woman gruesomely tortured an Indonesian maid for months and then starved her to death. The police recovered her starved, battered and bruised body with torture marks everywhere and found blood stains all over the house. They then realized the Emirati woman had been torturing and starving maids for a decade but they did not punish her or even arrest her, because the maids did not end up dead. Only when the Emirati finally managed to starve a maid to death did the Emirati police bother arresting her. There was a similar case which happened slightly before, where an Emirati tortured an African woman to death after months of abuse. Neighbours siad they heard screams and wails for months through the walls. Read it: http://www.emirates247.com/crime/local/woman-starves-maid-to-death-dubai-court-told-2016-02-26-1.622369Another case of what Emiratis are allowed to do with impunity:https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroad\u201cMy employer was like a lion with no mercy,\u201d she says. Marina says she was forced to work 22 hours a day without rest. She woke at 4am to start cleaning the family\u2019s fleet of cars and worked through to 2am the following morning. \u201cI had no time off, no time to rest ever. Even when I was trying to eat, she would be calling me: \u2018You are not here to rest. I paid a lot of money for you.\u2019 To her, I was a slave. I was not a human.\u201dAfter a month of working constantly on two hours sleep and little food, Marina\u2019s health was deteriorating fast. She lost sensation in the right half of her body and couldn\u2019t use her hands. \u201cI was so tired it felt like I couldn\u2019t control my brain. After a few weeks I was in so much pain, I couldn\u2019t walk or lift anything. I didn\u2019t know if my children were OK. I felt so alone.\u201dYet her female Emirati employer told her, \u2018You can\u2019t go back to the Philippines because I paid money for you,\u2019\u201d Marina says. She claims her employer threatened to get her sent to jail, or kill her, and screamed that she would dump her in the desert. \u201cShe told me, \u2018If I killed you, nobody would care and nobody would find you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Madam, if you want to kill me, go ahead.\u2019\u201d After this, Marina says, her boss tried to poison her. The husband of the house then threatened to beat her with a baton, and locked her in a prayer room for three days and nights with no food or water.\u201cI would just say to anyone who is thinking of going to work abroad, don\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will kill you and nobody will do anything to help.\u201dhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroadIn short what I am trying to say is that if you are not an Emirati, you are a subhuman slave to them, a beast of burden. The Gulf states are truly the most racist and dehumanizing places on earth for non-locals. Anyone who has lived in the Arab world for more than a few months knows full well that many of them genuinely and sincerely do not view migrant workers from Asia/Africa as fully human and treat them as animals. E.g. http://www.99media.org/slavery-in-the-arab-world/ \"The host, the mother of my acquaintance, reeled around laughing. \"This is not a human being, she [her maid] is an animal and will be treated as such\" Sometimes the level of prejudice is actually quite amusing because it's so farcical. For instance (and if you don't believe me on this, ask anyone who has lived in the Gulf), the way the police figure out who is responsible for a crime is not based on evidence but based on nationality. So for instance, if an Emirati man crashes into the car of an expat or migrant worker etc, that would be the fault of the expat because he's not Emirati and the former would be arrested.Always remember these incidents before you go to Dubai.

The Gulf states are truly the most racist and dehumanizing places on earth for non-locals. Anyone who has lived in the Arab world for more than a few months knows full well that many of them genuinely and sincerely do not view migrant workers from Asia/Africa as fully human and treat them as animals. E.g. http://www.99media.org/slavery-in-the-arab-world/ \"The host, the mother of my acquaintance, reeled around laughing. \"This is not a human being, she [her maid] is an animal and will be treated as such\" Sometimes the level of prejudice is actually quite amusing because it's so farcical. For instance (and if you don't believe me on this, ask anyone who has lived in the Gulf), the way the police figure out who is responsible for a crime is not based on evidence but based on nationality. So for instance, if an Emirati man crashes into the car of an expat or migrant worker etc, that would be the fault of the expat because he's not Emirati and the former would be arrested.Always remember these incidents before you go to Dubai.
