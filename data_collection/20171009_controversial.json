All he requires Christians to do is, at any point in their life, to accept Jesus and follow in his example, and that doesn't mean following every single niggling rule.

If we have love, and act with love in our hearts and minds, then it follows that most of those pesky rules will just become second nature. If we have love, we won't act with anger, jealousy, hatred, selfishness, or greed.Of course, humans are not perfect. We fuck up. No one acts with love every moment, and God understands this.

We hear male voices gently singing \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps: VOICE-OVER A way out west there was a fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And a lot about where he lived, like- wise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'. We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us. VOICE-OVER They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says. But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold-- wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. INTERIOR RALPH'S It is late, the supermarket all but deserted. We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case. He is the Dude. His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep. He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates. VOICE-OVER Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties-- just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes there's a man. The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk. He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs. VOICE-OVER And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. CHECKOUT GIRL She waits, arms folded. A small black-and white TV next to her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him. GEORGE BUSH This aggression will not stand. . . This will not stand! The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at the little customer's lectern. Milk beads his mustache. VOICE-OVER ...and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that--quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County. The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents. VOICE-OVER ...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide--but sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes there's a man. EXTERIOR RALPH'S Long shot of the glowing Ralph's. There are only two or three cars parked in the huge lot. VOICE-OVER Wal, I lost m'train of thought here. But--aw hell, I done innerduced him enough. The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot. Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk. The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night. After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points. DUDE It's the LeBaron. DUDE'S HOUSE The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court. He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other. He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door. INSIDE The Dude enters and flicks on a light. His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit. We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body. Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole. The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of doorframe. His head is plunged into the toilet. The paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor. The Dude blows bubbles. VOICE We want that money, Lebowski. Bunny said you were good for it. Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and gasps for air. VOICE Where's the money, Lebowski! His head is plunged back into the toilet. VOICE Where's the money, Lebowski! The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping. VOICE WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD! DUDE It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look. His head is plunged back in. VOICE Don't fuck with us. If your wife owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that means you owe money to Jackie Treehorn. The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet. The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. Looming over him is a strapping blond man. Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly and walks over to a rug. CHINESE MAN Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski. He starts peeing on the rug. The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses. DUDE Oh, man. Don't do-- BLOND MAN You see what happens? You see what happens, Lebowski? The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses. DUDE Look, nobody calls me Lebowski. You got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man. BLOND MAN Your name is Lebowski. Your wife is Bunny. DUDE Bunny? Look, moron. He holds up his hands. DUDE You see a wedding ring? Does this place look like I'm fucking married? All my plants are dead! The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel. He pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native. BLOND MAN The fuck is this? The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights it. DUDE Obviously you're not a golfer. The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile. BLOND MAN Woo? The Chinese man is zipping his fly. WOO Yeah? BLOND MAN Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire? WOO Uh? They both look around. WOO Fuck. BLOND MAN What do you think? WOO He looks like a fuckin' loser. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger and peeks over them. DUDE Hey. At least I'm housebroken. The two men look at each other. They turn to leave. WOO Fuckin' waste of time. The blond man turns testily at the door. BLOND MAN Thanks a lot, asshole. ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO: BOWLING PINS Scattered by a strike. Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc. The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike. A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail turns from the strike to walk back to the bench. MAN Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight. Mark it, Dude. We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man nursing a large plastic cup of Bud. He has dark worried eyes and a goatee. Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts. He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves cut off over an old bowling shirt. This is Walter. He squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he addresses the Dude at the scoring table. The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears some of its foam on his mustache. WALTER This was a valued rug. He elaborately clears his throat. WALTER This was, uh-- DUDE Yeah man, it really tied the room together-- WALTER This was a valued, uh. Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter. DONNY What tied the room together, Dude? WALTER Were you listening to the story, Donny? DONNY What-- WALTER Were you listening to the Dude's story? DONNY I was bowling-- WALTER So you have no frame of reference, Donny. You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know-- DUDE What's your point, Walter? WALTER There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason-- DONNY Yeah Walter, what's your point? WALTER Huh? DUDE What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about? WALTER Huh? No! What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here-- DONNY What the fuck is he talking about? DUDE My rug. WALTER Forget it, Donny. You're out of your element. DUDE This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about? WALTER What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue! I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude. Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American. Please. DUDE Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my-- WALTER What the fuck are you-- DUDE Walter, he peed on my rug-- DONNY He peed on the Dude's rug-- WALTER YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT! This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude. DUDE So who-- WALTER Jeff Lebowski. Come on. This other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug. Am I wrong? DUDE No, but-- WALTER Am I wrong! DUDE Yeah, but-- WALTER Okay. That, uh. He elaborately clears his throat. That rap really tied the room together, did it not? DUDE Fuckin' A. DONNY And this guy peed on it. WALTER Donny! Please! DUDE Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy-- DONNY His name is Lebowski? That's your name, Dude!

The usual line is \"oh they are my best friend since forever\" and somehow this excuses a mindless body which regurgitates opinions, likes seemingly profound statements that reinforce their flawed perception of the universe, or complete lack of judgement skills in terms of significant others.It seems with guys, there is at least this blunt honesty where the \"dumb ones\" (please forgive the cruel sounding words. Talking about intelligence with politically correct terms is better but I'm exhausted) sort of defer to an alpha-like smart person. Similar to how a skinny person might defer to a jacked person when moving a piece of heavy furniture.With women it's almost gambling to see if the friends are even close to similar with the person of interest, again in the limited context of my experience. I think there SHOULD be social pressure to better one's mind throughout life and the acceptance of soap opera guzzling idiots means they have less of an incentive to pick up a book of substance or to develop Socratic reasoning. If women motivated each other for intelligence the way they did for the gym, I just think society would be better off.TLDR: it feels like guys make their less intelligent friends more painfully aware of their deficiencies, whereas it seems like women are more happy to bury that painful truth about friends by talking about bullshit on that person's level.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": -37, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  9 18:08:44 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Females are fucking retarded", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 3604, "stickied": false, "score": -16, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  9 16:54:35 2017", "ups": -16}, {"body": "I don't think it's all men and I think it's important to clarify that, but there are definitely a large number of men on Reddit that have weird or down right hateful attitudes towards women.

We recently conducted a study investigating community succession after abandonment in abandoned cranberry bogs within the New Jersey Pinelands. Since the 1860's, the cultivation of the native American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, has been a major agricultural practice in the New Jersey pinelands. The pinelands have been well suited for cranberry production due to the sandy, organically rich soil and abundant sources of freshwater. Although cranberry agriculture can represent over a third of wetlands in the pinelands, the industry has been on the decline as it has moved to other regions of the country. As a result, many bogs have been abandoned. The effects of abandonment have not been investigated thoroughly. In this study, we explored the fate of bogs and examined bog succession after abandonment from time zero (an active cranberry bog) to 60 years abandoned in flooded and unflooded communities. A full inventory of plant and invertebrate species were collected from cranberry bogs of different ages from three locations. Community diversity and structure were determined from the inventories and a chronosequence for bog succession was developed. When a cranberry bog was left to dry, conversion from a wet savanna to either a mesic mixed forest or wooded swamp was observed. A cranberry bog that remained flooded transitioned to a lake, spung, or pond. With this information, recommendations can be made onto how the lands should be managed in the future in order to maintain healthy and native communities.Ask us your ecological questions and we'll be on around 1pm Eastern Time (17 UT) to start answering!

So as long as we are speaking about traits of a personality disorder, sociopaths and psychopaths get lumped together and I have read a book on Psychopathy that gave me a whole different appreciation for the very wide range of affects it can have on people.Dr. Kevin Dutton's book The Wisdom of Psychopaths was the book that really opened me up to at least understanding some core concepts behind the diagnosis and history of the disorder. I would say that yes, they can understand what makes them different. At the very least that they are different from other people. Another thing to point out is that while the disorders do breed bad apples, it's still the upbringing that holds the most weight. So the awareness in this scenario would come from childhood parenting. In the book one of the psychiatrists/psychologists that he talked to became aware of his own psychopath diagnosis while looking for others.

Because that's the thing, the emotions that are supposedly \"not there\" are there in most cases, but in less amounts. A researcher by the name of Kevin Dutton made a [really good point saying that it's like dials on a mixing board](http://www.kevindutton.co.uk/the-psychopath-mixing-desk/). For normal people those switches would be up in the 6 and 10s, but for the sociopath they would be more on the range of 5-1 with absolutely varying degrees. So some would have the dial, the emotion turned up enough to notice that it is there. But going back to empathy, some sociopaths CAN and do have empathy, but in a completely inhibited way. But that doesn't mean that they'll feel sorry for doing anything bad, because for the most part when they behave that way, there's always a reason behind it. Justification. Everything they do has been done by choice, so feeling bad about it is pretty pointless to them as they've really done nothing wrong from their point of view. But when they really think about it, they know the wrong they've done they just didn't pay attention or care enough to adjust their behavior. So to really answer your question, it's really a yes and no. It depends where the person with Sociopathy is at in their lives and how they were brought up and what they've done. Not all sociopaths are criminals or even diagnosed. So there will be varying degrees of cognitive empathy, so their perception of their difference will again vary.  Edit: The way they'll find out that they are different would be through trial and error. Most criminal sociopaths failed at fully adapting to their environment, so the same would be said for the noncriminal sociopaths, except for the ones that can adapt and \"mask\" their behavior to truly fit in. [A la the Mask of Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_of_Sanity)Really commenting any further would be pure speculation, it's really hard to seriously scientifically pin down whether or not most sociopaths can be aware, as most sociopaths that are talked about are the ones that have had the history of crime and the diagnosis to count. And the ones that aren't within these structures are hard to seriously analyze and study. Many research teams have tried, but have been highly faulty and completely inaccurate because the way the disorders are specified and the way the disorder itself can hide and blend in. But that's not to mean that the research isn't pointless, they're more on the lines of detailing the thoughts and traits of psychopathy within the general public, not people who would seriously be considered actual sociopaths/psychopaths.

But that doesn't mean that they'll feel sorry for doing anything bad, because for the most part when they behave that way, there's always a reason behind it. Justification. Everything they do has been done by choice, so feeling bad about it is pretty pointless to them as they've really done nothing wrong from their point of view. But when they really think about it, they know the wrong they've done they just didn't pay attention or care enough to adjust their behavior. So to really answer your question, it's really a yes and no. It depends where the person with Sociopathy is at in their lives and how they were brought up and what they've done. Not all sociopaths are criminals or even diagnosed. So there will be varying degrees of cognitive empathy, so their perception of their difference will again vary.  Edit: The way they'll find out that they are different would be through trial and error. Most criminal sociopaths failed at fully adapting to their environment, so the same would be said for the noncriminal sociopaths, except for the ones that can adapt and \"mask\" their behavior to truly fit in. [A la the Mask of Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_of_Sanity)Really commenting any further would be pure speculation, it's really hard to seriously scientifically pin down whether or not most sociopaths can be aware, as most sociopaths that are talked about are the ones that have had the history of crime and the diagnosis to count. And the ones that aren't within these structures are hard to seriously analyze and study. Many research teams have tried, but have been highly faulty and completely inaccurate because the way the disorders are specified and the way the disorder itself can hide and blend in. But that's not to mean that the research isn't pointless, they're more on the lines of detailing the thoughts and traits of psychopathy within the general public, not people who would seriously be considered actual sociopaths/psychopaths.

Shoutout to /u/bbrhuft, /u/urbanek2525, /u/tea_and_biology, /u/genius_retard, and anyone else who I may have forgotten. Thread TL/DR: There are two different paths that a plant can take to photosynthesize: C3 and **C4**. C4 is more efficient at doing this, so the best plants for getting that carbon out of the atmosphere would be something that goes through this pathway. A good common example is a **grass** or **bamboo**.A fast-growing plant like grass (bamboo) or algae will go through this process the fastest, but to keep the carbon locked away, it requires a fair amount of upkeep. You can't just bury the freshly cut plant because it will create methane. You will have to essentially \"burn\" it in an oxygen-free environment, creating charcoal, and then bury it away to keep that carbon out of the atmosphere (Shockingly, I didn't think of this before. Reverse the use of charcoal by... creating charcoal and burying it). The alternative to this would be planting a tree. As long as the tree is not burned, it will keep the carbon stored for a long time, with very little human input. This will do nothing for pollution because they aren't exactly related.

The findings reveal that, despite the situations of inequalities and invisibility of women in the countryside labor - with the persistence of \"multiple tasks\", participation and engagement in feminist and countryside social actions such as The \u201cMarcha das Margaridas\u201d, have contributed to the breakdown of paradigms rooted in society.

I was an active kid and would get jealous of boys and men who, after hours of play or work, took off their shirts and sometimes even tied them like sweatbands around their heads. As a teenager, I was never allowed to take off my bra, much less my shirt on scorching hot days and I've always resented that.For the last couple of years, my husband and I have been living in a relatively small but very socially liberal town. Women face no legal repercussions for nude breasts here even though it's extremely rarely seen. I've tried to talk to my husband about the possibility of going shirtless, not often or for attention, but out of comfort on hot 90+ degree days, and partly out of principle for what I was never able to do when I was younger.My husband basically told me that if someone ever saw me doing that, it would reflect badly on him, as people in his profession are very conservative. He also said that if his friends ever saw me, it would embarrass him and that he doesn't want his friends seeing my boobs. The latter part sort of hurts me because it's sad to hear my own husband reinforcing the ideas that kept me from doing a lot of things in my life. I used to get so tired of being told what I should and shouldn't be doing as a \"young lady\". Now I feel like I'm being told what I should and shouldn't do because I'm a woman and I have my husband (and his career and feelings) to think about. I know this is a pretty small ordeal, but for me, it's representative of a lot of things I'll never get to do. As a kid I thought I was going to grow up to be a boxer or a race car driver but I wasn't even allowed to have a model car or go on fishing trips with my uncles who, for years, have been too \"busy\" to teach me carpentry all the while struggling in vain to get the boys in my family interested. I just want to do something to make me feel that much less restricted by my gender but at the same time, I don't want to do anything that could potentially damage my husband's quality of life.

Working hard is a good thing, but it's also important to get a handle on your personal life as well. If you work really long hours I would strongly suggest looking into meal prep. If you have a day off use that to pack lunches and make dinners for the week. I usually eat a light breakfast of like fruit or cereal, but you can also make hot breakfasts and put them in the fridge or freeze them. This is a great way to save money because a lot of the time you are using the same ingredients to make things, which makes budgeting way easier.As far as actually learning how to cook set aside some time and watch YouTube videos. Buzzfeed has Tasty which is ok for beginners, and there are a ton of cooking and baking channels. If you have the money and don't have gas, maybe look at getting an induction burner or stovetop. It is much easier to control the temperature, and it's honestly worth the money. It's really hard to cook on electric, once it gets hot it stays hot for a while, induction goes up and down just like gas. You will make mistakes, but that's what will make you better in the long run and give you experience.When it comes to cleaning, laundry, and other chores it's all about getting yourself into a routine. You don't have to clean the entire house every day, and unless you live in a mansion as long as you regularly clean, it shouldn't take much time at all. What I would suggest is pick a room every day and clean it. This shouldn't take more than an hour, and it will make your life so much easier because it will prevent your house from becoming a mess, which takes a lot more time. You can get a laundry bag and do laundry every few days so you have clean clothes, and if you are single this shouldn't be too much of a burden. You can put a load in before you clean your room for the day, and be ready to put it in the dryer by the time you are done. Eat dinner, and then iron and fold your clothes. After that, you are pretty much ready to have a glass of wine, relax, and not be stressed out.I'm really sorry you are going through this, and I hope things work out for both of you.

Then the heavy labor is what falls by the wayside when you're really busy, like mopping, etc.  Could you afford a cleaning service once a month to do this stuff?  The other thing is that single people with busy busy lives don't really need a lot of home space.  I don't know what kind of home you guys have, but if it's a single family house, you should probably consider downsizing to an apartment or the equivalent--something without a yard to mow, gutters to clean, etc., and without a lot of floorspace to maintain.

Working hard is a good thing, but it's also important to get a handle on your personal life as well. If you work really long hours I would strongly suggest looking into meal prep. If you have a day off use that to pack lunches and make dinners for the week. I usually eat a light breakfast of like fruit or cereal, but you can also make hot breakfasts and put them in the fridge or freeze them. This is a great way to save money because a lot of the time you are using the same ingredients to make things, which makes budgeting way easier.As far as actually learning how to cook set aside some time and watch YouTube videos. Buzzfeed has Tasty which is ok for beginners, and there are a ton of cooking and baking channels. If you have the money and don't have gas, maybe look at getting an induction burner or stovetop. It is much easier to control the temperature, and it's honestly worth the money. It's really hard to cook on electric, once it gets hot it stays hot for a while, induction goes up and down just like gas. You will make mistakes, but that's what will make you better in the long run and give you experience.When it comes to cleaning, laundry, and other chores it's all about getting yourself into a routine. You don't have to clean the entire house every day, and unless you live in a mansion as long as you regularly clean, it shouldn't take much time at all. What I would suggest is pick a room every day and clean it. This shouldn't take more than an hour, and it will make your life so much easier because it will prevent your house from becoming a mess, which takes a lot more time. You can get a laundry bag and do laundry every few days so you have clean clothes, and if you are single this shouldn't be too much of a burden. You can put a load in before you clean your room for the day, and be ready to put it in the dryer by the time you are done. Eat dinner, and then iron and fold your clothes. After that, you are pretty much ready to have a glass of wine, relax, and not be stressed out.I'm really sorry you are going through this, and I hope things work out for both of you.

So try to make sure you have a place for things and don't leave stuff lying around.  Since you're not home a lot you won't be messing up the house.  Then the heavy labor is what falls by the wayside when you're really busy, like mopping, etc.  Could you afford a cleaning service once a month to do this stuff?  The other thing is that single people with busy busy lives don't really need a lot of home space.  I don't know what kind of home you guys have, but if it's a single family house, you should probably consider downsizing to an apartment or the equivalent--something without a yard to mow, gutters to clean, etc., and without a lot of floorspace to maintain.

I work banquets for a country club, so there's always left over food at the end of an event. There's a rule that employees can't take boxes of food after work, in case it makes us sick because then we could blame the club. That being said, some managers are even weird about us eating during our shift, when the leftover food is clearly going straight to the trash. But we all pick at the food anyways, because usually our shifts are 8+ hours and we get hungry. So, like I said, EVERYONE eats the food. However, this one manager of mine, let's call him Dan, singles me out if he sees me eating. I'm gonna lay out a few occasions:1.) One time, a wedding had donuts and after the guests had left Dan came to the wait station where a few coworkers and I were hanging out. He saw a donut on the counter and said \"the_contouring, is that your donut?\" And once I said no he called me a bad liar so one of the other girls had to stand up for me but he still left the room snickering to himself. 2.) Another time there was brownies left over and we were all cleaning up after the event. He said, very loudly, \"make sure the_contouring gets a brownie!!\" And I said no thank you, so he insisted again that I take one!! I said \"what's that supposed to mean??\" And he said \"I just know you like..strawberries\" (the brownies were topped with strawberries) I walked away, what kind of BS explanation was that? 3.) I was throwing away a tray of perfectly good food and a coworker and I took a bite before we tossed it all in the trash. Then I heard, across the whole kitchen, \"the_contouring DO NOT EAT THE FOOD. IT IS NOT YOURS TO EAT\" he literally yelled my name. That's the thing,  he says my name the whole time so everyone knows he's talking to me! 4.) Some coworkers and I were eating our employee meal in the break room (meal is served twice a day and we are allowed to eat it and take our break). Dan came by and said to me, \"You like those chicken tenders? How do you like them? Good right?\" ..... we were all eating tenders but he specifically asked me... stupid question because chicken tenders are always good lol. 5.)A chef let me take a leftover Caesar salad in a box but I knew Dan wouldn't like that. So I snuck it back to the wait station and he saw me and interrogated me, saying it seemed like I do this all the time and how is he supposed to trust that I haven't snuck food before? I was tearing up and sweating and was so furious. Because, again, I wasn't the only one with a salad. Notice all these occasions are always prompted by him when I'm minding my own business! There have been soooo many other instances, but I'm getting choked up thinking about it. I need help, I don't know what to say to this guy. I want to call him out in front of everyone like he does to me. But I've always been afraid to stand up to authority figures like that. He makes me want to quit my job but this is the first job I enjoy so it really hurts that I have to deal with something like this.

So that is why most have to dress a certain way, get a certain GPA, do volunteer work, behave a certain way, and only date guys their sisters approve of. Some of this might have changed but from the things I've heard from kids of my friends in college, not a lot has.

I despised the entire concept of the Greek system and I still think it's fairly backwards and riduculous. We used to call it \"rent a friend\" for people who have to pay to find people to be friends with. I know that's awful. I was young. Anyway, as I see it, the point of sororities historically has been to give \"elitist\" groups of women special access to date and potentially marry the \"elitist\" males at a school. Times have changed a lot. But still, when I was there they had mystery date nights that all the sisters had to participate in, where they went on dates with an assigned guy from their assigned fraternity, whether they were already in a relationship or not. Historically, sororities have fought very hard to be seen as quality groups of women who would make quality girlfriends and wives for frat boys. So that is why most have to dress a certain way, get a certain GPA, do volunteer work, behave a certain way, and only date guys their sisters approve of. Some of this might have changed but from the things I've heard from kids of my friends in college, not a lot has. And so for the most part, girls can't have their own rooms, can't have men spend the night, have a certain time when guests have to leave, to give the appearance that they aren't \"sluts\". This is why you aren't allowed to party like a frat does. If people saw drunk men leaving your house or heard of wild stuff going on, it would take the reputation of the house down a notch. Everyone wants sororities to party and have sex with and date frat guys, just do it at the frat  house so it looks like the guys are just being guys. It's all a big show.

I definitely did not consent by any means and tried to push him off of me several times and he turned rather violent. Fast forward through a few years of dental school and years of therapy later, I meet this truly amazing guy, we begin dating, etc. etc.  About three months into the relationship I accidentally cheated on him with another friend from dental school (with whom I had previously slept with a few times) after a night of drinking with that friend from dental school. I say accidentally because I was feeling really down that my boyfriend may leave me because who would want to put up with my issues? I mean I have so much baggage from the rape and am damaged goods to a lot of men for a lot of reasons. So I got absurdly drunk and slept with that guy from dental school to feel wanted sexually, and I was so drunk I do not even recall ever even seeing that guy or sleeping with him, but I know I did. I vaguely remember leaving and Ubering home after.About two weeks after finding out from that guy from dental school that I cheated on my boyfriend with him, I told my boyfriend. Being the saint that my boyfriend is, he gave me a second chance.  I did not deserve one, I know, but I was really glad he did.Shortly thereafter things begin going well for the next two months. We are just in heaven. But, I get this nagging feeling that my boyfriend isn't happy in bed with me. I feel like he isn't as attracted to me. I began texting that same friend from dental school about our sexual encounters and what he liked and what he didn't like, what I could do better in bed, etc. The conversation turned very sexually charged as the other guy kept inviting me over, to which I laughed off, but never said no. About a month later my boyfriend saw these messages and broke up with me. He said I was too dishonest and too disingenuous. In my head I was just trying to have a better grasp of sexuality and I did not know who to turn to because the only other person I have been sexual with is my rapist; however, my boyfriend does not see it that way by any means. There were also several other times throughout our 7 month relationship where some guys would come up to me in front of my boyfriend and hit on me and be very suggestive. I never would turn them down because I was afraid and to be honest I liked the attention in a weird way. My boyfriend would always get mad that I did not say \"no\" to them and rather just chuckled and smiled at their advances in front of him. Am I a bad girlfriend? Is this normal behavior?

It started with him trying to get my number out of the blue in which he said \"let's grab lunch\" and I said \"yeah our teams can grab lunch together\" then he proceeded to ask for my phone number. I didn't give my number of course.  I didn't think too much of it at the beginning until I started to notice he would wait for me to get to my car a few times in the following weeks. I would leave my office at different times and he would always be in his car with his windows rolled down and I would always walk by it.  Every encounter was a bit awkward because he and I don't even talk on a regular basis and he would just say bye. I would say bye and brush it off like it was nothing. One day I parked in a different section where I was not near his car. As I walked to my car, I noticed a car was idling near me...it was him in a different colored car. He told me he was driving his sister's car. Okay.... I didn't even know what to say. This is when I started to get weirded out. I started parking elsewhere since.One time he had told me that he would treat me to lunch if I had gave him a good recommendation. I had rejected his offer and said I was running errands (probably bad answer). Another time he had self-invite himself to join me for lunch as I walked past him on my way to my car. I told him I wanted to eat by myself and he said  okay, next time.  His actions seemed harmless but I was bothered by them. I didn't tell him straight up I wasn't interested hoping he would get my clues. I was wrong because he couldn't read my clues. The last straw was when he had self-invite himself to join me for lunch again. This time I said \"i want to eat by myself....have a good one\" and continued walking. This time his attitude changed and he started whining saying \"oh come on, do you never eat with anyone.....\" I honestly didn't hear what else he said because I was already uncomfortable he was whining out in the public on the sidewalk by the office. I continued to walk to my car with my back facing him and he followed me while still whining. I've had enough, turned around and told him \"NO MEANS NO!\" He backed off and said \"ok next time.\" WTF? I went to lunch so upset. I've had enough. The next day I saw him and told him that he needed to \"stop asking me to lunch going forward and that I wasn't interested. Do I make myself clear?\" I didn't even let him speak. I hope this time he got my message. Ugh. Update- wow this blew up. I appreciate the feedback. Me telling him was the first time I was setting it straight. If he bugs me again, I will escalate it. I also want to share that I had told this story to my female friend up to the story about the parking lot.

I definitely recommend doing that, he was super awesome and talked me through everything and told me we could stop at any point if I wanted to. Then during the placement he made a few jokes so that helped me relax. Overall the placement itself hurt a lot less than I expected, it really just felt like a normal period cramp and was over pretty quickly. Not the most pleasant of things, but not the worst pain I've ever experienced. I didn't have a cervix softener or numbing injection either. My doctor did an ultrasound before and after, but that's really standard procedure here in Germany. If you can afford it at all I would do the ultrasound, it just gives you the peace of mind that everything went well and the cramping you will inevitably have afterwards ist just your body getting used to it. I also went to the appointment alone, but I did get picked up by my bf afterwards and then went straight to the sofa with a hot water bottle, so if you can take the day off I would definitely do that.
