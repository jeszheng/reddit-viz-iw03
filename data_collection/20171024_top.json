In fact, he was in the first Basic UDT/SEAL (BUD/S) class to graduate under my command in 1985.  I remember him well and thought that he would have a stellar career.He did have such a career until he showed a defect in his moral make-up, and the Left is already well aware of what he did, although perhaps not in so much detail as I go into.  They will, however, before the general election, so I have decided to anticipate them by providing this statement.This information was provided to me by sources personally known to me and to those who were directly involved in the actions involving Ryan.What did he do?  Simple\u2014he used Navy (taxpayer) travel funds to make multiple trips from Norfolk, VA, to his home in MT, ostensibly to scout out training sites for his squadron.  The truth was that he went to work on some family property and, apparently, on one occasion, took two or three other Navy SEALs with him.These trips not only involved airfare, but they also involved per diem and personal use of Navy time.  To his credit, Ryan, when confronted with his transgressions, admitted his culpability and paid back the funds he had expended.Ryan\u2019s moral failings, in my opinion, do not end with his being separated from his SEAL team over the travel scandal.  His political career has some questionable acts associated with it, to include his creation (with some heavy-hitting New York and Boston lawyers and PR people) of Special Operations for America (SOFA), a Political Action Committee, back in early 2012.  At that time, I sought out Ryan to work with me in establishing an umbrella organization of Special Operations Forces from all the services.After looking carefully at the situation in which he was involved, I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable getting hooked up with what was clearly going to be a high-donor operation and possibly geared to Ryan\u2019s future political benefit.  That has turned out to be the case, as evinced by the fact that, almost immediately after Ryan declared his candidacy for the US House, he resigned as SOFA\u2019s chairman and was given a grant from the very Political Action Committee he established.  That, to me, is not \u201cconflict of interest;\u201d it is \u201ccoincidence of interest.\u201dThe account of what I have read about SOFA having its headquarters in property owned by the Zinke family that is across the street from the Zinke family home, further validates the \u201ccoincidence of interest\u201d hypothesis.As a retired Navy SEAL officer, I also take exception to the looseness with which Ryan described his Navy career.  Depending on which bio one reads, he was \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d commander in a certain high-capability Navy SEAL Team.  He was never a commanding officer and was bypassed for possible consideration for promotion to captain as the result of his travel transgressions.He also has stated that former Cong. Allen West has endorsed his candidacy.  I spoke with Colonel West personally and learned that, while he spoke kind words about Ryan, he did not endorse him.  Subsequent to my conversation with him, Colonel West has made clear that that was not the case and will not be the case during the primary.Having seen a heavily redacted copy of Ryan\u2019s DD-214, which is a summary of his military career, I noted that, unlike his claim to have received two Bronze Stars for combat, he actually received them for meritorious service.  Neither had the Combat \u201cV\u201d for Valor, which would have been the case had he earned the awards for combat.The statement by a retired Navy SEAL Master Chief sums up the essence of Ryan\u2019s character.  The man told me personally that Ryan is PNG (persona non grata) at his old SEAL team, primarily for the misleading statements he has made about his rank and importance at that \u201cspecial\u201d team.  That is a sad commentary on a man who had all the potential in the world and has, instead of coming clean about himself and his mistakes, tries to re-write his personal history in order to achieve political office.I am certain that Ryan would have acquitted himself well if he had led his men in actual combat instead of being a theater manager of the combat units assigned to him.I am sure that Ryan will do his best to rebut these serious allegations.  He can prove me wrong by making his unredacted DD-214 available for public examination.  I would like nothing better than to have been shown that I was wrong, but that won\u2019t happen.Why do I, a transplanted Texan living in NC, want to rupture more than one friendship over Ryan Zinke\u2019s candidacy for the US House of Representatives?  Simple\u2014Ryan\u2019s ambitions will not stop here.  He has shown by his dissimulation of facts regarding his career that he is willing to do whatever it takes to reach the next level\u2014in his case, the US Senate.  I cannot abide that prospect, because THEN he is representing ME and every citizen of this land as a member of one of the world\u2019s most prestigious deliberative bodies.Larry BaileyCAPT (SEAL), USN (Ret.)Chocowinity, NC*", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 9362, "stickied": false, "score": 871, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 24 17:32:27 2017", "ups": 871}, {"body": ">Whitefish Energy \u2014 had only two full-time employees on the day Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, according to the Post.Seriously?

This works in the short term and worked spectacularly in 2016, but it's inherently unsustainable. Consider: - US demographic growth is working against them - Texas, for one, will at some point before 2050 not be a reliable red stronghold. - There's only so far that Gerrymandering and exploiting the electoral college can take you and every time you pull that lever it pisses people off even more, ensuring an even higher turnout next election. - Gerrymandering protects districts that would normally be a toss-up but at the risk of making other seats competitive that would normally be safe. - Likewise, voter suppression can only go so far, when people get pissed off enough and politics dominates every discussion people suddenly feel motivated to jump through all the hoops and go vote. - GOP economic policies themselves, when actually implemented, fail miserably. Look at Kansas. People suddenly start paying attention when the state is suddenly poor and has to start raising taxes to pay for basic government services most people took for granted. Fool me once...All of these tactics that the GOP has used to keep itself on life support since Reagan lose effectiveness over time. They needed to rebrand themselves and come up with a new strategy but instead they just turned inwards to be more bigoted, mnore ignorant, and cheat more. The end result was Donald Trump - a PR atom-bomb for the GOP, but one that they themselves built and detonated.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 17351, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 00:17:05 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "That's a bold strategy Cotton, let's see if it pays off for him", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 29219, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 24 19:52:57 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "Now, if these senators would just call up their GOP buddies in the House to talk about drafting those articles of impeachment...", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1126, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 24 20:27:13 2017", "ups": 5}, {"body": "He thinks he\u2019s still a celebrity... but, we live in the United States where celebrities are well, celebrated.

He lost an arm, yes, but this does not mean that you can treat him with any less respect than you'd treat someone who has not lost a limb. Seriously, *this is not okay*.Did you ever lose a limb? No? Well, imagine you hurt your arm, and suddenly, you feel nothing. No pain, no numbness, **nothing**. You are confused and look... but there is no arm. Instead, there is blood, you can see a splintered bone and yet, you feel nothing. You want to cry, but again, you feel nothing. You try to take care of the wound, but really, how do you take care of an injury this huge. No band-aid in the world would help here. So, you are there, becoming familiar with the concept of not feeling anything, and suddenly it hurts. **It hurts**. You'd think that this is awful, but for the first few seconds, you are glad you feel something again. You realize that the adrenaline must have stopped you from feeling, and the pain returning is relief incarnate. Then the pain overwhelms you and you pass out.It's been two weeks. You are now no longer having an arm and are in recovery. Your job is gone as well, not like you'd be capable of doing it anyways with your lack of an limb, paying for a mechanical arm is way too expensive, and there is a lawsuit since the person who did this does not want to pay up for your bills. Life sucks, but you gotta pull through. Some times you contemplate suicide, wonder how it would feel to mix your aspirin with bleach and tobacco to drink that mix up. But you manage.It's been 2 months. You are having phantom pains on a weekly basis, where your arm hurts, even if it should not, **since there is no arm**. Your family is sick of you, taking all their attention with your lost limb and your suicide attempt. You take medicine and you hate it, the bills keep stacking up, your lawsuit ended in the jury blaming you for the accident and making you pay, not to mention about your incapability to get a job. You have fallen to drugs, painkillers that help you ease the day, not helping with your pain though, since there is no arm that can recieve the painkiller. You are certain that your anti-depressants are just placebos, you consider dropping them every single day. You gained weight, sports do not even remotely interest you anymore as about every single sport you enjoyed is no longer doable because you have no arm.It's been 2 years. You learned telekinesis. Nowadays, you just float things around with your nonexistant arm, you are capable of lifting things that you could not before, your arm would not be able to lift it or would surrender to the pain of thorns on the object, but then again: You have no arm. Your mental fortitude is incredible, most likely formed by the fact that you had to resist all self-destructive temptations, the drugs, and arrest by the police every single day. You live your day doing insane stuff, people around you think you work with someone to impress others, no one believes you. Merely your time on Reddit makes you capable of interacting with people who do not see you as crazy, a trickster or both. You stay away from r/occult, as they are mostly just a nerd club, but rather feel intrigued by r/gaming and r/Terraria. You considered posting a \"I can levitate stuff with my lost limb, AMA\" post at one point, but stopped it since you suspect no one would believe you anyways. There was an interesting topic on r/Terraria, about a real life biome in a light bulb. You wanted to express your concern that this is alright and does not need to be removed for relevancy, when a person makes a joke about your lost limb, and it all comes back.The pain.The loss.The risks.And you realize that it never stopped, and it never will.

If it does, and an argument can be made that due to its pervasiveness it should be treated as a public forum, than in order to ensure the first amendments' *relevance*, the first amendment can and should apply.Now this is a serious issue that is only going to get more attention as traditionally public forms of communication die and privately owned entities take over that role.

On Monday, The Washington Post reported that Whitefish Chief Executive Officer Andy Techmanski is friends with Trump administration Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Moreover, Whitefish is located in Zinke\u2019s hometown of Whitefish, Monatana.That seems a bit more suspect. That seems like crony capitalism. >Zinke isn\u2019t the only member of the Trump administration with a connection to the Whitefish contract. In addition to the Colonnettas\u2019 contributions to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Kimberly Colonnetta\u2019s Facebook page contains a photo of her with Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development. Another photo appears to show Kimberly Colonnetta with Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Both photos were posted the week of Trump\u2019s inauguration.Pictures together at a ball/gala of sorts don't really bother me either. Donors trying to get pictures with people they donated too doesn't really raise any red flag. >The Colonnettas\u2019 contributions to the Republican Party precede the Trump administration. For example, in October 2011, Joe Colonnetta contributed $30,000 to the RNC; in 2008, he gave $26,200 to the RNC and $28,500 to the McCain Victory Committee. During both years, Kimberly Colonnetta also contributed thousands to various Republican campaigns.So it seems like more of a Republican thing than Trump himself.

It is used in more than 750 different products for agriculture, forestry, urban, and home applications. Its use has increased sharply with the development of genetically modified glyphosate-resistant crop varieties. Glyphosate has been detected in air during spraying, in water, and in food. There was limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate. Case-control studies of occupational exposure in the USA Canada and Sweden reported increased risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma that persisted after adjustment for other pesticides. The AHS cohort did not show a significantly increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In male CD-1 mice, glyphosate induced a positive trend in the incidence of a rare tumour, renal tubule carcinoma. A second study reported a positive trend for haemangiosarcoma in male mice. Glyphosate increased pancreatic islet-cell adenoma in male rats in two studies. A glyphosate formulation promoted skin tumours in an initiation-promotion study in mice. Glyphosate has been detected in the blood and urine of agricultural workers, indicating absorption. Soil microbes degrade glyphosate to aminomethylphosphoric acid (AMPA). Blood AMPA detection after poisonings suggests intestinal micro bial metabolism in humans. Glyphosate and glyphosate formulations induced DNA and chromosomal damage in mammals, and in human and animal cells in vitro. One study reported increases in blood markers of chromosomal damage (micronuclei) in residents of several communities after spraying of glyphosate formulations.Bacterial mutagenesis tests were negative. Glyphosate, glyphosate formulations, and AMPA induced oxidative stress in rodents and in vitro.

Only one wing of the World Health Organization has accused glyphosate of potentially being dangerous, the IARC, and that report has come under fire from many people, such as the [Board for Authorisation of Plant Protection Products and Biocides](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ctgb.nl%2Fnieuws%2Fnieuws-berichten%2F2015%2F04%2F27%2Fctgb-oordeel-over-iarc-artikel-over-carcinogeniteit-van-glyfosaat&edit-text=&authuser=0) in the Netherlands and the [German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment](http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/does-glyphosate-cause-cancer-expert-group-to-address-diverging-assessments-within-the-who.pdf) (PDF).  Several other regulatory agencies around the world have deemed glyphosate safe too, such as [United States Environmental Protection Agency](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-05-01/pdf/2013-10316.pdf), the [South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries](http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/media/Media%20statement%20on%20glyphosate.pdf) (PDF), the [Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority](http://archive.apvma.gov.au/news_media/docs/glyphosate_scitox_review_july_2013.pdf) (PDF), the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture, Belgian Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety, Environment, the Argentine Interdisciplinary Scientific Council, and Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency.  Furthermore, the IARC's conclusion conflicts with the other three major research programs in the WHO: [the International Program on Chemical Safety, the Core Assessment Group, and the Guides for Drinking-water Quality](http://i.imgur.com/6ggQyDJ.jpg).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 190613, "stickied": false, "score": -4, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 24 21:34:44 2017", "ups": -4}, {"body": "This is just the tip of the iceberg, and Monsanto isn\u2019t the only guilty party.

It is used in more than 750 different products for agriculture, forestry, urban, and home applications. Its use has increased sharply with the development of genetically modified glyphosate-resistant crop varieties. Glyphosate has been detected in air during spraying, in water, and in food. There was limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate. Case-control studies of occupational exposure in the USA Canada and Sweden reported increased risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma that persisted after adjustment for other pesticides. The AHS cohort did not show a significantly increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In male CD-1 mice, glyphosate induced a positive trend in the incidence of a rare tumour, renal tubule carcinoma. A second study reported a positive trend for haemangiosarcoma in male mice. Glyphosate increased pancreatic islet-cell adenoma in male rats in two studies. A glyphosate formulation promoted skin tumours in an initiation-promotion study in mice. Glyphosate has been detected in the blood and urine of agricultural workers, indicating absorption. Soil microbes degrade glyphosate to aminomethylphosphoric acid (AMPA). Blood AMPA detection after poisonings suggests intestinal micro bial metabolism in humans. Glyphosate and glyphosate formulations induced DNA and chromosomal damage in mammals, and in human and animal cells in vitro. One study reported increases in blood markers of chromosomal damage (micronuclei) in residents of several communities after spraying of glyphosate formulations.Bacterial mutagenesis tests were negative. Glyphosate, glyphosate formulations, and AMPA induced oxidative stress in rodents and in vitro.

No new cases anywhere in the world since then.In addition to the 12 wild cases there have however been an additional 61 cases of vaccine-derived Polio in 2017, all of them surfaced in Syria and DR Congo.

Theprincipal components of the plan are asfollows: > - (1) biocontainment of all polioviruses,including wild, Sabin, and vaccine-derivedstrains, to reduce the riskthat a laboratory accident will reintroducepoliovirus into a susceptible population;> - (2) maintenance of highly sensitivesurveillance for circulating polioviruses,so that outbreaks are detectedquickly; > - (3) stockpiling of monovalentOPV strains, to control any outbreak thatmight occur; and > - (4) simultaneous globalOPV cessation, so that population immunityis at the highest possible levelwhen the last dose of OPV is administered,to minimize the chances of circulatingVDPV (vaccine-derived polio virus) emerging.> A remaining risk is the long-term excretionof polioviruses by certain classesof immunodeficient individuals, a phenomenonrecognized 30 years ago. Hypogammaglobulinemicpatients are particularly susceptible to vaccine-associatedparalytic poliomyelitis and have been mostcommonly found to be long-term excretersafter developing paralysis. Some, however,have remained asymptomatic for manyyears.      > Presumably, countries with identifiedchronic excreters of poliovirus will continueto use inactivated vaccine until thesepersons die or until it is clear that theyno longer pose a threat. Because 1 personhas been excreting VDPV for at least 20years and remains healthy, IPV maystill be needed for decades.Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5621533/", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 243955, "stickied": false, "score": 38, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 02:14:38 2017", "ups": 38}, {"body": "Bill Gates is the man.Keep up the great work!:)", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1997, "stickied": false, "score": 20, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 02:37:56 2017", "ups": 20}, {"body": "I read some time ago that researchers had detected polio virus in samples taken from sewage in several major cities in developed countries.

No new cases anywhere in the world since then.In addition to the 12 wild cases there have however been an additional 61 cases of vaccine-derived Polio in 2017, all of them surfaced in Syria and DR Congo. [Here's more on why vaccine-derived polio is a thing and how it can be tackled](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/vaccine-derived-polio-eradication-disease-immunisation-world-health-organisation-jonas-salk-a7582511.html)---Also interesting: **What will happen when polio is declared eradicated globally?**> The World Health Organization has recently developed a plan for stopping the useof OPV (oral polio vaccine which contains live viruses) worldwide after the certificationof global polio eradication. Theprincipal components of the plan are asfollows: > - (1) biocontainment of all polioviruses,including wild, Sabin, and vaccine-derivedstrains, to reduce the riskthat a laboratory accident will reintroducepoliovirus into a susceptible population;> - (2) maintenance of highly sensitivesurveillance for circulating polioviruses,so that outbreaks are detectedquickly; > - (3) stockpiling of monovalentOPV strains, to control any outbreak thatmight occur; and > - (4) simultaneous globalOPV cessation, so that population immunityis at the highest possible levelwhen the last dose of OPV is administered,to minimize the chances of circulatingVDPV (vaccine-derived polio virus) emerging.> A remaining risk is the long-term excretionof polioviruses by certain classesof immunodeficient individuals, a phenomenonrecognized 30 years ago. Hypogammaglobulinemicpatients are particularly susceptible to vaccine-associatedparalytic poliomyelitis and have been mostcommonly found to be long-term excretersafter developing paralysis. Some, however,have remained asymptomatic for manyyears.      > Presumably, countries with identifiedchronic excreters of poliovirus will continueto use inactivated vaccine until thesepersons die or until it is clear that theyno longer pose a threat. Because 1 personhas been excreting VDPV for at least 20years and remains healthy, IPV maystill be needed for decades.Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5621533/", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 243955, "stickied": false, "score": 39, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 02:14:38 2017", "ups": 39}, {"body": "not if anti vaccinators have anything to do with it", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5979, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 02:47:54 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Do MRSA next", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1607, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 02:56:09 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "Soon we can flip the blue medicine bottle over on the board.

The company has been linked to the Secretary of the Interior.The electric company in PR has said that 95% of services will be restored by Christmas, however, the Whitefish CEO says he doesn't know where that estimate comes from, as his company has not done an evaluation.EDIT: Thanks to those who have pointed out that the contracted prices are the billable costs to the company, and the subcontractor ultimately gets a fraction of that after Whitefish Energy takes its share. The article doesn't say what the cost of mutual assistance would have been, though it mentions other companies shied away from bidding because of PR's uncertain financial situation. My comment: Expertise/strategy aside, the time for Whitefish to ramp up its numbers (currently 280) has to be weighed against the thousands of skilled workers that would have been available via mutual assistance.  Given that Whitefish hasn't surveyed most of the island, we're pretty much guaranteed they won't meet PR's timeline--and the cost will be much greater than $300M.

October 23, 2017Dear Parents/Guardians:Today, the Charles County State\u2019s Attorney unsealed a third indictment charging former Charles County Public Schools (CCPS) instructional aide Carlos Bell with additional sexual abuse crimes against children.These charges are a result of additional video secured from electronics the Charles County Sheriff\u2019s Office confiscated from Mr. Bell. The Sheriff\u2019s Office only recently gained access to the additional video content. CCPS continues to cooperate fully with the Sheriff\u2019s Office and the State\u2019s Attorney to ensure that justice is served.The third indictment includes all charges filed against Mr. Bell since the Sheriff\u2019s Office first arrested him in June 2017. The 206-count indictment includes 28 identified alleged victims and 14 unidentified alleged victims. Attached is a copy of a press release from the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.The investigation is continuing. Mr. Bell remains jailed without bond and the judge continued the protective order prohibiting the release of information about the victims.Since first learning of the charges against Mr. Bell, CCPS has implemented measures to strengthen our staff training and improve our procedures. We continue our stringent background checks, which include fingerprint-based criminal background checks and cross-referencing of state and national sexual and violent offender registries as part of our pre-employment process. At the time of his hiring, Mr. Bell was not listed on any previous sex offender registry and had no criminal record.

So my cat is batshit crazy and we belong together. I bottlefed him from a week old. Some lady had brought him into a vet's office in a shoebox, saying she found him tangled in some vines on the side of the road. He also had a respiratory infection and what looked like an injury but turned out to be a bot fly! I volunteered to bottle feed him and we bonded HARD. You could tell he was crazy then. I didn't encourage that behavior whatsoever, but I knew the crazy was strong with this one. While he loves the shit out of me, he does not like anyone but me. He's more tolerant of people that aren't afraid of him, but no one has officially crossed the threshold into \"like\" territory. I used to have a running joke to first time visitors.. \"Are you on blood thinners by any chance? Well, never mind, You'll probably be fine!\" It was probably only funny to me and I would lock him out of the living room (it had its own door which was convenient). Locking him up when guests came over was no problem. But then I had my daughter when he was 3 years old. I gave him chances. I gave him a stupid amount of chances. The second time he got her in the face (good) I had to act. I talked to my vet to get her opinion and she said she thought it was the right course of action and that his front paws would be sensitive for about a week. So I did it. Had him declawed, front only. The first 3 of 4 days were pitiful as shit on account of the love I have for this cat. Just watching him having to \"take it  easy\" and I still remember how he would adjust his little paws to try to get comfortable... it ripped my heart out. It's been 4 years since then and I think I have probably said out loud 50x that I am so glad I had him declawed. It was for his own good. For all of our own good. He was never going to stop scratching/hurting people (the blood thinners joke didn't come out of thin air). Plus now I have TWO kids to protect. Now he just slaps HARD. You can actually hear it. It leaves people impressed. But no one is left bleeding or potentially blinded. And he gets to hang out with company a bit more often, which he likes. He loves being around the action. As far as the biting, he only does that when he's being overstimulated (usually by me) and most of the time he gives me a warning by touching me with his back claws. He doesn't even open his eyes if he's trying to sleep. He's just like \"bitch stop, that's enough petting.\" So he knows he's still got claws back there. It just takes a lot more work to scratch with the back claws, or either an accident (like running across their face in the night), but that's much less likely. I can't tell any other difference in him. I'm certainly not advocating for it and the thought of him getting outside fills me with terror. I hope to god that never happens. I seriously love this cat. And I think if we could have communicated about it, he wouldn't want to leave me. We're ride or die (except for when it comes to him scarring/blinding my children for life!). His 14 pound ass is sleeping on my pillow right now above my head. I think he takes up about 75% of it. Did I mention he's beautiful? Edit: I did try the temp nails everyone is talking about. They're called Soft Paws but they just kind of pop off everywhere (thought they were supposed to last for 6 weeks) and I was afraid of the baby choking on them.

So my cat is batshit crazy and we belong together. I bottlefed him from a week old. Some lady had brought him into a vet's office in a shoebox, saying she found him tangled in some vines on the side of the road. He also had a respiratory infection and what looked like an injury but turned out to be a bot fly! I volunteered to bottle feed him and we bonded HARD. You could tell he was crazy then. I didn't encourage that behavior whatsoever, but I knew the crazy was strong with this one. While he loves the shit out of me, he does not like anyone but me. He's more tolerant of people that aren't afraid of him, but no one has officially crossed the threshold into \"like\" territory. I used to have a running joke to first time visitors.. \"Are you on blood thinners by any chance? Well, never mind, You'll probably be fine!\" It was probably only funny to me and I would lock him out of the living room (it had its own door which was convenient). Locking him up when guests came over was no problem. But then I had my daughter when he was 3 years old. I gave him chances. I gave him a stupid amount of chances. The second time he got her in the face (good) I had to act. I talked to my vet to get her opinion and she said she thought it was the right course of action and that his front paws would be sensitive for about a week. So I did it. Had him declawed, front only. The first 3 of 4 days were pitiful as shit on account of the love I have for this cat. Just watching him having to \"take it  easy\" and I still remember how he would adjust his little paws to try to get comfortable... it ripped my heart out. It's been 4 years since then and I think I have probably said out loud 50x that I am so glad I had him declawed. It was for his own good. For all of our own good. He was never going to stop scratching/hurting people (the blood thinners joke didn't come out of thin air). Plus now I have TWO kids to protect. Now he just slaps HARD. You can actually hear it. It leaves people impressed. But no one is left bleeding or potentially blinded. And he gets to hang out with company a bit more often, which he likes. He loves being around the action. As far as the biting, he only does that when he's being overstimulated (usually by me) and most of the time he gives me a warning by touching me with his back claws. He doesn't even open his eyes if he's trying to sleep. He's just like \"bitch stop, that's enough petting.\" So he knows he's still got claws back there. It just takes a lot more work to scratch with the back claws, or either an accident (like running across their face in the night), but that's much less likely. I can't tell any other difference in him. I'm certainly not advocating for it and the thought of him getting outside fills me with terror. I hope to god that never happens. I seriously love this cat. And I think if we could have communicated about it, he wouldn't want to leave me. We're ride or die (except for when it comes to him scarring/blinding my children for life!). His 14 pound ass is sleeping on my pillow right now above my head. I think he takes up about 75% of it. Did I mention he's beautiful? Edit: I did try the temp nails everyone is talking about. They're called Soft Paws but they just kind of pop off everywhere (thought they were supposed to last for 6 weeks) and I was afraid of the baby choking on them.

I live in (CA-01). My corrupt Congressman is Republican Doug LaMalfa. He hires a very rude staff. Among this staff is Erin Ryan. I\u2019m going to share with you every lie she\u2019s ever told me\u2026Feb 17th, 2017I think that by paying close attention to what is coming from our office you\u2019ll find that the congressman is very involved throughout the district and does pay very close attention to our issues. He spends the majority of his time here on the west coast traveling to meet with constituents and work on issues with them.  I think you would like him if you met him and will watch for an opportunity to make that happen in the future.Feb 23th, 2017Honestly, if you want to believe the anti-republican propaganda that\u2019s out there you are free to do so.  It is very popular to bash these days and distort the facts and let\u2019s not forget the anger and blaming that has become the norm.  We do our level best to be respectful and courteous to our constituents and for that reason I will not respond to your tirade in kind. There is no reason to \u201chide\u201d from anyone and we will certainly be having town hall meetings in the future.March 3rd, 2017I\u2019m a grownup working in a congressional office. In my world we learn to work with all sorts of people who have all sorts of issues.  I\u2019m not going to take any abuse from people but in general I\u2019m pretty easy going.  Remember, it all starts with your attitude ;-)March 4th, 2017We have no way of knowing what party our constituents are because that information is not even available to us in our data base and frankly we don't care.  Our staff meets with and assists constituents who are Democrats, Republicans, Independents, etc.March 26th, 2017We also don't have any way of knowing how our constituents vote.March 30th, 2017Joshua,I\u2019m not one to drop hints.  If I were trying to dismiss you the message would be crystal clear. From here on out I will be happy to pass your concerns on to the congressman and not provide any unsolicited information.April 7th, 2017*Joshua, you need to find a different hobby.

(no)But there is a limit here as well; at what point does a representative's advocacy and exercise of religion become a violation of the establishment clause? (When he writes a law establishing religion)The primary contention is the constituent believes that the representative should not host religious images on his Congressional website. The constituent believes this display of religious images violates the establishment clause of the 1st amendment.There is an unfortunate conflation of the 1st Amendment prohibition on the writing of laws establishing a religion, and the philosophical belief that the church and state should be separate. Is the representative's hosting of religious images on his congressional website the equivalent of passing a law establishing a religion? Certainly not.Does the representative forfeit the rights to exercise his religion or freedom of the press, (his website) by serving in public office? Again, no.Does the constituent have the right to petition his representative concerning this perceived grievance? Absolutely.The above should be restated and clarified for the constituent and the matter should be closed. However, repeated contact by the constituent to remove religious icons from the member's congressional website, after an explanation that the member was within his rights to host such images, begins to tread on the grounds of harassment over religious affiliation.Continued petitioning by the aggrieved constituent, is no longer protected when the threshold is crossed and verbal/written harassment becomes religious persecution. The danger here is in establishing a right for constituents to persecute representatives for their religious beliefs under the guise of petitioning the government for the redress of grievances.Note: If this case involved the right to assemble peaceably, we would have 1st amendment bingo.Edit: the religious references aren't mentioned in most articles. Here is a link to the constituent's own account of a phone interaction: [Link](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/6/2/1668354/-LaMalfa-staffer-Brenda-Haynes-was-rude-to-me-on-Facebook) ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1197, "stickied": false, "score": -1, "submission_time": "Wed Oct 25 01:05:33 2017", "ups": -1}, {"body": "From: https://www.newsreview.com/chico/congressman-the-kid/content?oid=24934982>The Browns reported that LaMalfa\u2019s camp was receptive to Joshua\u2019s messages at first, with staffer Erin Ryan emailing the boy to thank him for visiting the Redding office.So, the Browns were able to meet with a representative of their representative. But then....>...she became aware we opposed LaMalfa\u2019s policy choices she became more belligerent and argumentative over time,\u201d Robert said.And then....>Joshua claims that when the town hall was finally held on April 19, LaMalfa\u2019s staff blocked his attempts to publicly address the congressman.Seems like LaMalfa's staff need to learn how to manage constituents especially publicly. >In May, another LaMalfa staffer, Brenda Lee Haynes, posted to Joshua\u2019s Facebook page in a conversation about separation of church and state. When Joshua mentioned he wasn\u2019t religious, Haynes responded: \u201cSo the good news is you\u2019ve at least identified your problem. Now you can begin to fix things. Good luck.\u201d Later in the online conversation, she tells Joshua: \u201cYou have much to learn in life, but with your obvious lack of respect for your fellow man, chances are you won\u2019t get very far.\u201dHow often was too often to contact?>\u201cTo be honest \u2026 too many to count,\u201d Joshua said.>Mark Spannagel, LaMalfa\u2019s chief of staff, spoke to the CN&R, but said he was unable to release much information.Weird that no one can quantify the offending numbers of communications. I'm not sure how a representative can legally compel one of their constituents to cease contact. It will be interesting to see if this plays out in court.
