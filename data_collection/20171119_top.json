If you click on the link and look at the exoskeleton the knee joint and hip joint are just simple pin joint. In reality, the knee joint when it flexes has a quite complex trajectory. To compensate, the velcro bands around the thigh and calf end up moving up and down a little bit. In addition to the discomfort this causes over long periods of heavy exertion (the forces on those velcro bands will scale with the load you are carrying), this dissipates energy which apparently quickly causes exhaustion during testing.

Digital used to be a miracle. We were all fascinated by the new things that the technology was able to do. Articles would go on endlessly about the latest circuit architecture or the processing algorithms that made it possible. But there were those in the general public that just didn't care about any of this. How it happened is not a concern for them. Can it be smaller and faster? That's all that matters. Personally, I grew up in the world of phonograph records and books. They're heavy and bulky. Whenever anyone moved the big issue was always what to do with all of those books and Records that they never read or listened to. Moving the boxes of books was right up there with moving the big bed or armoire.  Personally I always preferred paperbacks and cassettes. I realized early that I never read any book twice except for reference books. And nobody cares about the feel of the pages when you are looking up some obscure facts or a formula. Records suck. Other than the fact that they are hard to store there's also the inescapable noise and skipping. One of my favorite records as a teenager was a black sabbath record where it was so warped that the needle would always skip at exactly the same places. I went to a friend's house where he had a much better turntable that would handle the Warped record and I was so thrilled to be able to actually listen to it. But you know with digital none of those issues even come up. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love real things I like things that are made well and not made out of plastic but when it comes to things like media and the things that computers can do such as look up any fact ever known in just a few seconds I vote for technology. Anybody who's ever tried to use an encyclopedia to look up something remembers.

We will be with digital until we die. Analog? Analog is a fleeting infatuation. Its that 22 year old undergrad that catches your eye.

It's not about digital vs analog on any level.  It's about being discerning in terms of what you use and buy in to. If you really prefer vinyl, then fine (doesn't turn me on at all, pointless, slow and expensive, takes up space, just don't see the point, but if it's your thing I won't judge (at least not to your face)).  The big brother element creeps in to so many digital things, sometimes it forces you to do things in ways you find unpalatable, so many people choose alternatives. For example, I hate the Audible audio book player, so I use another whenever I can. Sometimes I am forced to use Audible and I really don't enjoy it.  My kids seem to be totally okay keeping a database in their head of friends they keep in contact with via whatsapp vs facebook vs texting or whatever. I refuse to add more methods and more nasty apps to my phone, it's text or phone or email for me. I refuse to have the facebook messenger app installed. That causes inconvenience occasionally, but it's better than having my battery drained and having my phone interrupt me every time someone likes some meaningless statement or a photo of someone's lunch.  Rather than ranting forever, all I am trying to say is we need to be discerning enough to use things that work for us, and if something doesn't, or stops doing the job because of an \"upgrade\", then go with something else, vote with your wallet.

He was once an active leader of the Communist Party of Kampuchea that brought on the Khmer Rogue Mass Genocide that kill nearly 2 million Cambodians from 1975-1979. He changed side and took control of the new \"democratic\" government we have now but really he is dictating it hence the three decade he has held his seat.With this move to force US funding out of the country and arresting his opposition in the election, he is essentially securing his power yet again again in the country. The US backing out and pulling funds would be completely in Hun Sen's favor. The US looses their pull on the country and China gets to take full advantage of the many investment and infrastructure they already have pumped into the country.Now quick history on U.S and Cambodia. The U.S began a four year long carpet-bombing campaign in 1969 during the Vietnamese War that dropped up to 110,000 tons (debatable amount as some claim more) of bombs on over 113,000 sites in Cambodia with little to no regards for civilian life (this also effected Laos greatly). See the [map here](https://gsp.yale.edu/case-studies/cambodian-genocide-program/us-involvement-cambodian-war-and-genocide) from yale the area bombs were dropped. This bombardment destabilize the existing fragile government Cambodia held at the time giving opportunity to the Communist Party of Kampuchea to take over which was exactly what they did in 1975.
