I secretly even like being a bit tight on money for a while, having to actualy consider what to purchase and sometimes even having to say \"Nope, can't afford it right now\" or \"It's not worth the money\".Long(er than expected) story short:* Challenge yourself, find something you want to do and find out how to do it. [Want to learn how to fly? you CAN! Like painting? you CAN!]* Money doesn't make happy. It can help, but it can also even make you more uphappy!* Don't *try* to be happy too much. Once you stop asking wether you are happy or not, you'll become a lot happier. You'll stop asking this once your mind is occupied with other (positive) things.

Ran into a girl I knew from middle and high school. We got to talking and went on a few dates. On one of the dates we had a few drinks and started talking about our intimate desires.

As a dude, I was like holy shit this is probably what every guy wants to hear.Nothing happens that night, but two days later she hits me up in the middle of the day (we were both on semester break) to come over. She answers the door in some cute lingerie and we go inside and start getting intimate. Everything is going well and then we start having sex. It was like all the worst pornhub videos I had ever seen. This girl was moaning and screaming over the top. Talking dirty to me in such an exaggerated manner that I had to pull myself closer into her and bury my face in a pillow while we were going at it so I wouldn\u2019t laugh. I\u2019ve been with plenty of girls and I know I\u2019m just slightly above average with my equipment down there, so the whole time I\u2019m thinking no fucking way is she serious. It got to the point where it actually turned me off because it was just way over the top (think cheesy 90\u2019s porn moaning and screaming). I ended up pretending to cum and that was that. We hung out a few more times but it was the same experience and I couldn\u2019t do it.It sucked because this girl was extremely intelligent and beautiful with a great family, a total catch.

I thought I'd try a for a bit plus I was making a little cash.  On my arrival I realised that she had also roped in one of her flatmates.

I didn't want to but I was too scared to say no so I tried to dodge it by asking if she had a condom, and she didn't. We of course didn't have sex that night but she got my snapchat. A few days later she sends me a message saying, \"Do you want to get high and hook up sometime?\" I thought to myself, \"Whatever, I'm sad so I'll just do it\" We were both free that night so we decided to make plans for that night. While we were making the plans, she didn't respond to me for a while so I got pretty sad. I normally don't masturbate that often but I did because I got sad haha.

She asked if I wanted to see a movie and I said yes. I got happy because I thought it was turning into an actual date and not some meaningless hookup. We had a lot in common and she was really smart so I started thinking about actually dating her in the future.

It utilizes non-linear optical effects of materials.First effect it uses is  If you shine light with frequency f on a material, then the electrons of the material will follow the light's frequency. If you turn up the intensity of the light then the electrons will also oscillate at 2f, 3f with each higher term being progressively weaker. The oscillating electrons at higher frequency can be used to sum two photons to a third photon of higher frequency or split one photon into two others. This can be done as long as your material has a high non-linearity (a stable workhorse is beta-barium-borate or BBO for short), you have high laser intensity and you uphold energy and momentum conservation of the involved photons. This way you can for example turn two 800nm photons into one 400nm photon. The other effect is called self-phase modulation. This effect also appears when highly intense laser beam passes through a material. The materials electrons respond in a nonlinear way which makes the index of refraction intensity dependant. This in turn modifies what we call the phase of the light differently during the pulse and since the time derivative of the phase is the frequency, the end result is that the pulse creates new colors. Sorry if this is not understandable but i find it really hard to explain - the gist of is that an intense pulse creates more colors as it passes through a material. The TOPAS works the following way: You input a short, (thereby) intense laserpulse. A small part of the light is split off with a beamsplitter and is send through a material to create a wide range of colors through self-phase modulation. This \"white light\" is then send through a BBO crystal with the remaining input light. Here we can selectively amplify a specific color from the broad spectrum by turning the BBO crystal. Turning the crystal helps ensure proper *phase matching conditions* for that specific color. What phase matching means is basically that the light you want to amplify and the other \"pump\" beam \"walk in step\" for as long as possible in the non linear crystal. Why turning the crystal helps is because it is birefringant but that is a whole other story. So actually you are not changing the frequency of the beam strictly speaking - you are creating a new one from the old one.

It utilizes non-linear optical effects of materials.First effect it uses is  If you shine light with frequency f on a material, then the electrons of the material will follow the light's frequency. If you turn up the intensity of the light then the electrons will also oscillate at 2f, 3f with each higher term being progressively weaker. The oscillating electrons at higher frequency can be used to sum two photons to a third photon of higher frequency or split one photon into two others. This can be done as long as your material has a high non-linearity (a stable workhorse is beta-barium-borate or BBO for short), you have high laser intensity and you uphold energy and momentum conservation of the involved photons. This way you can for example turn two 800nm photons into one 400nm photon. The other effect is called self-phase modulation. This effect also appears when highly intense laser beam passes through a material. The materials electrons respond in a nonlinear way which makes the index of refraction intensity dependant. This in turn modifies what we call the phase of the light differently during the pulse and since the time derivative of the phase is the frequency, the end result is that the pulse creates new colors. Sorry if this is not understandable but i find it really hard to explain - the gist of is that an intense pulse creates more colors as it passes through a material. The TOPAS works the following way: You input a short, (thereby) intense laserpulse. A small part of the light is split off with a beamsplitter and is send through a material to create a wide range of colors through self-phase modulation. This \"white light\" is then send through a BBO crystal with the remaining input light. Here we can selectively amplify a specific color from the broad spectrum by turning the BBO crystal. Turning the crystal helps ensure proper *phase matching conditions* for that specific color. What phase matching means is basically that the light you want to amplify and the other \"pump\" beam \"walk in step\" for as long as possible in the non linear crystal. Why turning the crystal helps is because it is birefringant but that is a whole other story. So actually you are not changing the frequency of the beam strictly speaking - you are creating a new one from the old one.

They function on the photovoltaic effect. The effect is similar though.Individual atoms have energy levels, the valence level is the highest energy level that is occupied by an electron when unexcited, the ground state. There's higher levels above that that are unoccupied, and then finally there is a certain ionization energy threshold where the electron is freed. When you put a whole bunch of atoms together into a solid, each energy level shift slightly off the energy of the levels that an individual atoms has. When you have countless atoms together, you end up with basically continuous energy bands that electrons can occupy. The valence band it the highest occupied band in ground state. The band above it is the conduction band, and as the name implies electrons in it are free to conduct electricity. The bandgap is the energy difference between the highest part of the valence band and the lowest of the conduction band. Metald have zero bandgap, hence are good conductors. Insulators (at least simple crystalline solid ones) have a large bandgap. This means very few electrons are in the conduction band, be it by photons or temperature giving them the energy, and they are poor conductors. Semiconductor, like silicon from which solar panels are made from, have a small band gap in the range of a few electronvolts. So the photoelectric effect is a photon of sufficient energy to completely ionize an electron. Right at the threshold simply frees the electron, excess energy simply adds kinetic energy to the freed electron. The typically engage off the photoelectric effects in some metals is the UV range or higher energy. The photovoltaic effect relies simply on a photon knocking an electron up one level from the valence to the conduction band. You don't want to ionize the electrons. Once up into the conduction band, the build in voltage that a p-n junction has sweeps the electron away leading to an electrical current. The bandgap for silicon corresponds to near infrared photons, in the range of 1200nm. Anything near IR through visible to near UV will work. Anything higher energy and you get ionization from the photoelectric effect and it's useless. So the actual electric current itself is based on the built in barrier voltage. A higher energy photon doesn't give it more electrical energy, it's simply wasted as heat. A near IR photon is as useful to a solar panel as a red, blue, or UV photon is. A solar panel's output is based on the number of photons with energy above the bandgap, not the energy of the photons. A trillion red photons will have the same electrical output as trillion UV photons, the extra energy of the UV photons will simply go to waste. 1000W of red photons will have a higher output than 1000W of UV photons, as there are more photons in 1000W of red photons. Only a small fraction of the sun's output is UV, and a given energy of UV means even less photons given higher energy in each one. As such, UV absorbtion is really not a goal of solar panels. So if a cloud blocked visible light but let UV through (I'm not commenting on the validity of that premise), that wouldn't mean a solar panel should work at high output on a cloudy day as UV really isn't that useful.  That said, there is some wavelength tuning for solar panels. Different semiconductors have different bandgaps, so chosing the material alters the lowest end of photons it can absorb. Increasing the bandgap can get more energy out of a single photon, but you are cutting out more and more photons from contributing. The penetration depth is very important. The penetration depth, the average depth a photon makes it to before being absorbed, is wavelength dependent. The built in barrier voltage that actually moves electrons is only present right at the p-n junction, the meeting place between the two different doped (added impurities) sides. If a photon is absorbed before this, it doesn't contribute to electrical current. If it's absorbed past it, it also doesn't contribute. As such, the junction depth needs to be tuned for an optional wavelength. You can build mutiple junctions at mutiple depths and achieve very high efficiency. Tunning bandgaps to get more electrical energy out of higher energy photons, and tuning the penetration depth to be right at the junction for the photons you want. In here you could have UV tuned junction layers. These multi-junction panels far out do your typical solar panels, but only are in lab environments really. Large scale economical manufacturing isn't viable yet.  Certain organic semiconductors can also form mutiple excitons (qausi atom like particle of an electron bound to its missing spot or hole in the valence band) with a single higher energy photon. So in silicon a single IR and UV photon will only drive one electron each, but here the IR could drive one and the UV drive two.

They were still able to generate power after Reactor 4 began to melt down, and the building exploded.RBMK reactors are a kind of reactor which use light water as a coolant, and graphite as a moderator. The \"flaw\" in the RBMK design that you often hear about is the fact that they have positive void coefficients. There are some definitions to make before I explain what that means.There is a quantity called the multiplication factor (k). This tells you the ratio of the number of neutrons available for causing fission reactions in the current generation to the number in the previous generation. If you want the fission chain reaction to exactly sustain itself, without any excess or deficit of neutrons (criticality), you want k to *exactly* equal 1.You can then define another quantity called the reactivity \u03c1 = (k - 1)/k. This is just another way to gauge whether the reactor is critical (\u03c1 = 0), supercritical (\u03c1 > 0), or subcritical (\u03c1 < 0).Finally, you can define a quantity called the void fraction (x), which is simply the ratio of the volume of gas in the core to the total volume of the core. Gases have very low density compared to liquid and solid, so they're essentially transparent to neutrons. The void fraction represents the fraction of the reactor core volume which is gas (in this case, steam).The reactivity of the core depends on a lot of variables, like temperature, core density, etc. You can define various reactivity coefficients which describe how the reactivity changes when you vary a certain quantity.Finally, we define the void coefficient. This is just how the reactivity changes as a function of void fraction.\u03b1*_v_* = d\u03c1/dx.This is just how the reactivity of the core changes with void fraction. If you make a small change in void fraction, for instance by boiling a little bit of water into steam, the response of the core reactivity will bed\u03c1 = \u03b1*_v_* dx,where dx is the change in void fraction and d\u03c1 is the resulting change in reactivity. Now it's clear that if the void coefficient is positive, it means that increasing void fraction (liquid -> gas) implies an increase in reactivity, and decreasing void fraction (gas -> liquid) implies a decrease in reactivity.If you think about what that means for a second, it's clear that that's **bad**. In a well-designed reactor, you want your reactivity coefficients to be **negative**, so that you establish stabilizing negative feedback loops, rather that destabilizing positive feedback loops.If you increase the RBMK core temperature a little bit, a little bit more water boils. The void fraction increases. This causes an increase in reactivity, which means in increase in neutron population. That means an increase in fission rate, which means an increase in power, and an increase in core temperature. Increased temperature means more water boiling. It's a positive feedback loop. You don't want that; you want a negative feedback loop.In other kinds of reactors, like the water-moderated BWRs used outside of ex-Soviet countries, the void coefficient is negative. So if a little water boils, it leads to a *decrease* in reactivity.So that's often stated to be a flaw with the RBMK reactors. However the truth is that there are lots of these reactivity coefficients (for void fraction, temperature, etc.), and it's very hard to engineer a system where **all** of them are negative. Each reactor design has its benefits and drawbacks; none are perfect. The void coefficients of RBMKs tend to be large and positive, which is not good.

Here's what we know so far. These soldiers went to a meeting in an area near the border with Mali a well known hot spot for ISIS.

They traveled in pickup trucks.Our soldiers were given faulty intel that said, \"it was unlikely that they would meet any hostile forces.\" Of course, they walked into an ISIS ambush. It was chaotic and they took three lives. It took the French 30 minutes to arrive. When they did they were not authorized to help. So, a dozen of our Green Berets fought a battle with more than 50 Isis fighters, without help, for 30 minutes.Finally, a rescue helicopter arrived, but it was not a US military helicopter. No, we outsourced that job to \u201cprivate contractors.\u201d So, these contractors landed and loaded the remaining troops, the injured and the dead.Here's where this gets really bad...Because they were not military, they never did a head count. That is how Sgt. La David Johnson was left behind. That's right...they left him behind.According to the Pentagon, his locator beacon was activated on battlefield, which indicates that he was alive when they left him there. They recovered his body 48 hours later but are refusing to say where.According to his widow, she could not have an open casket. This means that he was mutilated after being left behind on the battlefield. This is what led to the nonsense we're obsessing over. This is the real story. As usual, we're allowing it to be about Trump's distraction, but this is Benghazi on steroids. The Trump Pentagon gave these men bad intel, no support, outsourced rescue people and then tried for more than a week to pretend it never happened.

Why don't you start reading [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongo_Tongo_ambush)>In 2013, the United States under President Barack Obama sent 150 military personnel to Niger to set up a surveillance drone operation that would aid France in its counterterrorism efforts in the Northern Mali conflict.[7] In October 2015, Niger and the U.S. signed a military agreement committing the two countries \"to work together in the fight against terrorism\".[8] The Green Berets were sent to train the Niger Armed Forces to assist in the fight against terrorists from neighboring countries.[7] As of October 2017, there are about 800 U.S. military personnel in Niger, most of whom are working to build a second drone base in Agadez.To all the people acting like this is a scandal, or wondering why our troops were there, I just answered your question with a quick google search to a wiki article, which also points out that Obama sent them there.US special forces fight terrorism all over the world. It doesn't get talked about on the news in the vast majority of cases.I don't understand what the scandal here supposedly is. US troops are in harms way. They will get ambushed sometimes. They will die sometimes. Just because an ambushed happened, doesn't make this an intelligence failure that somehow had political ramifications.Benghazi is world's apart. There, the State Department half-assed its security and refused to improve it despite being warned in advance. State relied on contract islamist militia for defense, which was a joke since these guys obviously weren't going to fight their own kind, and they were predictably absent. Benghazi was a known terrorist hotbed, which is why we had a significant CIA operation there. Worst of all, though, is how the incompetence and failures that led to Benghazi were blatantly covered up with brazen lies about some bullshit video and supposed protests, none of which actually happened. Benghazi was a calculated terrorist attack by organized islamist militias who State idiotically considered to be allies.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 26997, "stickied": false, "score": 17, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 21 08:48:01 2017", "ups": 17}], "url": "https://shareblue.com/republicans-who-obsessed-over-benghazi-silent-on-4-us-troops-killed-in-niger/", "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "green": 0.35043495890000004}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": 0.2143556923, "top_comments": [{"body": "As a reminder, this subreddit [is for civil discussion.](/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil)In general, be courteous to others.

Clearly our democracy is not suited for this era.

Now, though? In a society where we know enough about the world and have the requisite resources to fix almost every basic issue we are still struggling with? In a society with billionaires and homeless people? A society with the means and motive to mine asteroids and solve most of our resource needs? An intelligent, benevolent dictator right now would result in the greatest progress in human history. We need something where decisions are tailored for the best results and based on evidence and facts instead of emotions - a feat which I don't think our current government will ever be capable of. Perhaps we could design an AI that is programmed with our societal values and knowledge of various aspects of the economy, with specialized AI for different sectors. We could reprogram it every couple of years as a society to change the basic things we are aiming for and then have the AI figure out the best way to achieve that, with some form of human intervention team that is subject to a great amount of scrutiny. Obviously you then run into the issue of who is writing the code and other similar issues around control of the AI, but surely we could solve for that much more easily than we can for the amount of idiots currently in our government.It is so incredibly frustrating to live in a world where we could automate away vast swathes of the labor force and yet we don't because...what?

Please read the following to better understand and contextualize Putin's motives in sowing division in the United States.Browder's Senate Judicial Committee testimony clarified reasons as to why the Russians would collude with Trump. He confirmed that Putin/Russia was closely tied to the Trump campaign;The Magnitsky Act was implemented in 2012 as an anti-corruption measure against Russian Oligarchs, Browder was a key player as a lobbyist who lobbied in favour of implementing these sanctions. He operated an investment firm in Russia and was on a crusade to stop government/business corruption in Russia. His firm was stolen so he hired a lawyer, Magnitsky, who found corruption all throughout the Russian government. Magnitsky, the lawyer Mr. Browder had hired, was imprisoned and tortured to death by the Russian government. Mr. Browder was under the assumption that if he brought forth corruption allegations to the government senior officials would side with him and his crusade against corruption.

Much of it belongs to those very close to Putin and quite possibly his own money too as Browder estimates he is worth approximately $200 Billion.

Is the fact that ISIS and not Boko Haram carried out the attacks not true anymore? Is the fact that the Diffa region, where Chad withdrew it's troops, is on the eastern border and the attacks on Us troops was on the western border not true?There is plenty to be upset about in this attack, but this Chad troop withdraw isn't one of them.

English translation below:>Researchers Positive Technologies Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy found a serious vulnerability in Intel ME technology, through which attackers can perform unsigned code on the target machine. This leads to a complete compromise of the platform. >**What is the problem**>Intel Management Engine is a closed technology, which is a microcontroller integrated into the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) with a set of built-in peripherals. Through PCH, almost all communication between the processor and external devices takes place, therefore Intel ME has access to almost all data on the computer. Therefore, the ability to execute third-party code allows you to completely compromise the platform. >Intel ME technology has long been of interest to researchers, but lately, even more attention has been focused on it. One of the reasons for this is the transition of this subsystem to a new hardware (x86) and software (modified MINIX as an operating system) architecture. The use of the x86 platform allows using the full power of the binary code analysis tools.>Unfortunately, such a large-scale processing has not been without errors. When studying the new subsystem in the Intel ME 11+ version, Positive Technologies researchers discovered a vulnerability that allows performing unsigned code inside PCH on any motherboard for processors of the Skylake family and above. In this case, the main system can remain functional, so the user may not suspect that his computer is running spyware, resistant to reinstalling the OS and updating the BIOS. The ability to execute your own code on the ME opens up unlimited possibilities for researchers, since this allows you to at least explore the system in dynamics.>**What's next**>On how to find and exploit the vulnerability, as well as bypass the built-in protection mechanisms, Positive Technologies experts Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy will speak during his speech at the Black Hat Europe conference , which will be held in London from 4 to 7 December. >Earlier researchers published in our blog on Habr an article on how to disable Intel ME 11 using the undocumented mode .**TL;DR:** A vulnerability in the Intel Management Engine in Skylake and newer Intel CPUs allows the execution of unsigned code, which could be used to completely compromise the system. In this case, the main system can remain functional, so the user may not suspect that his computer is running spyware, resistant to reinstalling the OS and updating the BIOS.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 137180, "stickied": false, "score": 23, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 21 05:39:40 2017", "ups": 23}, {"body": "Woops, who would have thought?

English translation below:>Researchers Positive Technologies Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy found a serious vulnerability in Intel ME technology, through which attackers can perform unsigned code on the target machine. This leads to a complete compromise of the platform. >**What is the problem**>Intel Management Engine is a closed technology, which is a microcontroller integrated into the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) with a set of built-in peripherals. Through PCH, almost all communication between the processor and external devices takes place, therefore Intel ME has access to almost all data on the computer. Therefore, the ability to execute third-party code allows you to completely compromise the platform. >Intel ME technology has long been of interest to researchers, but lately, even more attention has been focused on it. One of the reasons for this is the transition of this subsystem to a new hardware (x86) and software (modified MINIX as an operating system) architecture. The use of the x86 platform allows using the full power of the binary code analysis tools.>Unfortunately, such a large-scale processing has not been without errors. When studying the new subsystem in the Intel ME 11+ version, Positive Technologies researchers discovered a vulnerability that allows performing unsigned code inside PCH on any motherboard for processors of the Skylake family and above. In this case, the main system can remain functional, so the user may not suspect that his computer is running spyware, resistant to reinstalling the OS and updating the BIOS. The ability to execute your own code on the ME opens up unlimited possibilities for researchers, since this allows you to at least explore the system in dynamics.>**What's next**>On how to find and exploit the vulnerability, as well as bypass the built-in protection mechanisms, Positive Technologies experts Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy will speak during his speech at the Black Hat Europe conference , which will be held in London from 4 to 7 December. >Earlier researchers published in our blog on Habr an article on how to disable Intel ME 11 using the undocumented mode .**TL;DR:** A vulnerability in the Intel Management Engine in Skylake and newer Intel CPUs allows the execution of unsigned code, which could be used to completely compromise the system. In this case, the main system can remain functional, so the user may not suspect that his computer is running spyware, resistant to reinstalling the OS and updating the BIOS.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 137180, "stickied": false, "score": 25, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 21 05:39:40 2017", "ups": 25}, {"body": "Woops, who would have thought?

Young women are also more likely to be harassed digitally and feel pressured to participate in sexual acts they may not be comfortable with. The combination of the two has led to young women feeling uncomfortable with their burgeoning sexualities. I believe this is a very relevant issue that is not getting enough attention.

I think we're probably way more common than people realize, but we're reluctant to admit to it because of misguided notions of masculinity. When I was very young my parents used to go to the nearby casinos on the weekends, and before they went they dropped me off at my cousin's house. I was no older than 5. My male cousin was about 7 years older than me. Nearly every time I was left there, after his parents went to sleep he groped and fondled me and tried to get me to perform oral sex on him. I didn't understand what was happening but I knew it was weird, and he told me that I'd get in a lot of trouble if I told my parents, so I never did. I sort of buried/repressed that memory and didn't realize until my 20s what was actually going on then.When in 8th grade, a girl that I didn't like (as in she was a bully, nothing to do with attraction) stalked me in the hallways at school and she liked to grab my butt, which I didn't like and I made sure she knew. Didn't matter. She did it a handful of times after that anyway.Does sexual harassment on dating sites count? I'm straight and my profiles always make this clear. Almost all of the messages I get on dating sites are from gay men aggressively trying to convince me to \"experiment\" and stuff. Just really sexual gross stuff that comes without even having a conversation first or me indicating in any way that I'm open to that. I've been catfished twice by gay men and it's pretty strongly turned me off of online dating. I met my last/only-ever girlfriend on Tinder and she is awesome, but she's the only exception to the rule. I'm autistic and have a really tough time in face to face interactions, so online dating was pretty much the only way I had to meet anyone that didn't make me an incoherent mess on the inside.I came to TwoXChromosomes to share my story and maybe get some perspective on it because I've been seeing the #meToo campaign on Facebook lately.

The recent \"me too\" posts on Facebook brought back some bad memories. I didn't add my voice to it because I didn't want to open that door to the people that know me and I still don't feel comfortable talking about it 30 years later. I've been thinking about it though and I felt like I should share my perspective because others doing so empowered me.I was dirt poor and a neglected child. I didn't know it at the time but sometimes I'll recall things that viscerally validates my perspective. My poverty and neglect must have been obvious to many and especially so to my abuser. My abuser worked in the school library. We would have library classes once a week where we learned about the Dewey Decimal system and how to use any available resources.My abuser was an older woman. I can't even recall who she is or what she looked like, but whenever we went she would take me aside and fondle me from outside my clothes. I didn't understand what was happening and assumed she didn't realize that her hand was there. I dreaded going there. It happened every time for years. Then one day, I don't know why, I realized that it was intentional and I became angry. My solution was to bring a pocket knife and stab her in her hand. I was terrified that she would move her hand and I would stab myself but I thought it was a risk worth taking. I don't know why, maybe she just saw the anger in my eyes or something, but she avoided me that day and never came near me again.I completely forgot about this. The \"me too\" posts brought the memory back. I was a small child and she was comparatively powerful, but what I realized was that I don't have that dread and all of those feelings that I'm not smart enough to articulate anymore. I'm a large man now. I don't have to ever worry about that. I escaped from that place in my life.For many, that isn't possible. Most women are smaller than most men. They won't have the feeling of safety that being a larger man brings. They have to find a way to live and cope with that stress in a way I never had to. I can't imagine or understand that. It's  dynamic that no longer exists for me. On top of that is dealing with the disbelief of those who hear them. I didn't share my story because I was afraid of having to have any conversations about it. I didn't share because I thought people might find it to be attention seeking. I didn't share it because I was ashamed even 30 years later. I guess what I am saying is that I understand what women are talking about, but I still can't relate even though I dealt with it as a child.

It took time for me to even admit to myself that what had happened was rape and not just \"a misunderstanding.\" Even admitting to having been raped to myself was such a shameful and humiliating experience that I disassociated from myself as a way to pretend that it didn't happen. That meant that although I \"knew\" something was wrong, and that I felt unsettled around the men who assaulted me, I couldn't really explain to myself why. Typically after a new sexual partner, I would feel giddy around them afterwards, even if the sex wasn't particularly great. I love sex, I find it one of life's great joys. But understanding the difference between consensual sex and rape once I had experienced both was so distasteful and embarrassing that my mind fought against believing that it had happened to me.By the point, several weeks later in each case, that I admitted that what had happened to me was a massive violation, it seemed even more crazy to then completely cut off the people who had done it to me after so much time had passed and we were still friendly. I keep trying to write out paragraphs explaining my experience and I can't even quite get the words out, so I'll skip it and just say that even though that first sexual encounter was surely rape, I still continued to sleep with him for weeks afterwards. In a way, I justified to myself that what had occurred was inevitable, it was just some confusion. I mean, I was objectively attracted to him, but in a less inebriated state, I felt that I would have negotiated my way out of a sexual situation. I hadn't wanted to sleep with him. Besides, he was my access to substances, and after my recent breakup, I was relying on them more than I ever had. See, there's a power dynamic in play. He knew I was an addict.

On the way there, my sister randomly bursts into tears. When my mum asked why, she pulled up her jeans to reveal scarring on her legs. She also pulled back her sweatshirt sleeves to show a bunch of scars on her arm. Needless to say my mum was shocked because she had never suspected anything was up with my sister.When prompted, my sister explained that recently she's been super anxious and depressed because of school. Apparently some other girls are being mean to her by spreading rumors and calling her fat. She's also expressing feelings of loneliness and also has started experiencing panic attacks.She also explained that she felt a lot of pressure not to tell my mum because she wanted to be the normal child in the family. She knows how much my mum stresses out about my brother (30 year old male, alcoholic with gambling addiction and anger problems) and (to a lesser extent) myself (24 year old male with depersonalization disorder + GAD) that she didn't want to upset her even more with her problems. They had a chat with each other while driving and my sister said she felt a lot better after getting it all off of her chest. I told my mum that although she feels better now, from experience, pressure will build up again and she'll have another outburst unless there is a frequent dialogue between the two. My sister is at my house now and my mums asked me to have a chat to her about anxiety and how to deal with it.To add context, I had my first panic attack at aged 16 but was showing signs of anxiety since I was a small child. No one had caught on though. After my first panic attack, I was left in a state of chronic depersonalization/derealization which has not dissipated once for the 8 years that I've had it. Through the years I've managed to make peace with it and learned to just live with it. I'm not working or anything but I'm of sound mind and don't really experience panic attacks from the DP/DR like I used to.Anyway, with all of this in mind, my mum asked me to have a chat with her. One thing I do know, from experience, is that cutting isn't always as bad as it seems. I'm certainly not going to suggest that to either my mother or sister. I've never cut myself but I do remember in high-school that it was the edgy thing to do and a lot of teens participated in it simply to show off. Don't get me wrong, I am not suggesting that's why she's doing it, I am just taking that into consideration.Currently, my sister is seeing the school counselor, which is a good start, but I've advised my mum to maybe look into something a little more comprehensive. I think she should talk to my sister and see what she thinks is best, but my opinion would be to see a specialist outside of school.Anyway, with all that said, I need some advise from you all. I can see some similarities between my sister now and me when I was a teen but I am a male. From what I've seen, boys and girls differ when it comes to anxiety, depression, etc, etc. I was more preoccupied with life, death and existence whereas she's struggling with self-image, self-worth and fitting in. Can someone please give me some advice on how to handle the situation? I have a basic idea of what I'm going to talk to her about but what are so do's and don'ts?Thanks!

First of all, it wasn't done by somebody that I would call a scientist, more a hobby project. It has been peer-reviewed by scientists, so that's good, but not quite the same. Second, the methodology isn't perfect, around 30 traps are all that have been used, so that's not exactly enough data for this area to have enough statistical significance to say anything except maybe that something in these specific areas changed. Third, the traps have been used for a year or two a few decades in the past, not for a long time continuously. So who can really say that the first time they tested wasn't the unusual years with too many insects, and we are right now at the norm? Or the other way around, that the low amount this year is just because the climate was bad for insects this specific year, and they will be back to normal levels in a year or two.Last, though about this one I'm absolutely not sure, I tried to find something about it but didn't find an answer that satisfied me, I don't know how universal the traps are. Maybe there was just a shift from more wasps to more bees or something, and bees are less likely to get attracted to the traps. Or any other variant, or a whole bunch of those. Maybe there was just a shift in how the population is split, not in the mass of the population.To be clear, I don't want to say the study is wrong or something, at the very least it deserves for more studies to be made in the area. I just think that the way most are reporting and talking about it isn't exactly scientific, and especially the 80% number that gets thrown around everywhere is just awful with the amount of data available.

After she survived cancer, she sold her house and liquidated her retirement fund to start the White Rose, and despite its place in the community, this first year had been a financial struggle. The cafe was running week-to-week before this happened. On Monday, the cafe was mostly deserted. Many of the people who came in were friends, offering condolences and dropping $10 or $20 into the tip jar.

She has shut down all of her social media (which has led some of frustrated haters to move on to attack a business that made a video about the White Rose before the controversy).
