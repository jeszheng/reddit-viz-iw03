Almost 60% of graduate students who receive tuition waivers are students in  STEM fields. I am currently studying to be a nuclear physicist. STEM students are absolutely CRUCIAL for innovation and overall progress of society. Less graduate students in STEM means less research assistants (which hampers progress) but also less teaching assistants to teach undergraduate recitation and laboratory classes which will delay undergraduates from graduating on time (perhaps forcing them to take out more student loans). This will lead to a great burden on professors and universities, impede progress for the betterment of our society, and the US will lose the competitive edge we have been fighting to keep.People seem to misunderstand what a tuition waiver is. There is ZERO exchange of money. It's not a scholarship. I have worked extremely hard in highschool and in my undergraduate study in order to secure that tuition waiver for my graduate studies. It is, essentially, a coupon. The university has deemed that I am a valuable asset and am deserving of not being charged tuition as I, and most other graduate students, will contribute much more to society in the long run. I spend 60-80 hours a week on research and only barely scrape by on my meager stipend. If a tax plan passes that makes tuition waivers taxable income... absolutely no good will come from it. It will make higher education inaccessible to those who are not independently wealthy and those who do not want to shoulder a massive amount of student loans (whose interest would not be tax deductible). This tax bill shifts the tax burden from those who are the most financially secure to those who are more educated. It will be absolutely devastating to everyone.There are about ~150 THOUSAND graduate students that have earned a tuition waiver. A tiny fraction of the ~171 MILLION tax units.I'm not going to lie. STEM fields are extremely hard, extremely competitive, and time intensive- which is why the number of graduate students in STEM is so tiny. In order to get students into these very hard and very competitive fields the universities have to find some way to incentivise it. One way is to offer tuition waivers to these promising students so that instead of having to shoulder an immense amount of debt they can teach and do research while they get their degree and then continue to help society progress afterwards. Without a tuition waiver I would have to take out loans of 300k for my graduate tuition alone, while as a physicist I would only (on average) make between 50-100k/yr (please note: most STEM students I know aren't in it for the money). A prospective physics graduate student under the GOP tax plan would be digging themselves a grave they could never hope to claw their way out of. With a taxed tuition waiver, my stipend will be reduced by 35%. I could take out an unsubsidised student loan of the difference (for me it would be 7.5k) at 6.6%, every single year for six years, sure. That would be on top of the subsidised and unsubsidised loans from my undergrad. The GOP is basically disincentivizing higher education and saying that societal progress isn't as important as giving the rich tax breaks on private jets and reducing corporate taxes by an incredible degree.

The problem is not that the top doesn't have enough. The problem is not that our government is regulating them so that they cannot operate. It is that companies refuse to die when they are no longer needed. They do not need tax cuts to remain competitive. They need to innovate. And the people need to take control back of our country. These mega corporations are holding us back. We should be competing in areas like Clean Energy, like China is. We invented so much of the technology that will drive the future, but we couldn't implement it, because Mega Corporations held us back and went to war against us to take control instead of dying the deaths they deserve. just look at Canada, they figured their shit out. Healthcare. Equal rights for it's citizens. America is a joke. We do not invest enough in our economy or people. Our wages are stuck in the 80's. The cost of living is untenable. We have daily mass shootings. A drug epidemic. It's not because Mexican's are smuggling them into the country. It's us. It's a health crisis, and we can't even get health care. We're being taken advantage of. Our quality of life is far too low as a nation for us to purport to be the richest nation on earth. We used to be, but our wealth was stolen. Now they have nearly taken complete control. We're hanging on by a thread. We're waiting for Muller to save us, but that's not guaranteed. It is not guaranteed that the American experiment will survive. Our kids may never know what real freedom is. Freedom worth dying for.

Even asking the question would throw the entire system into disarray, as Maj. Harold Hering learned in 1973. Hering was a 21-year Air Force veteran who was decorated for his flying in Vietnam before being sent for training as a nuclear missile squadron commander. He had been taught that officers had an obligation to disobey illegal orders. So when he was told how to launch a nuclear attack, he asked what seemed like a simple question: How could he be sure that an order to launch his missiles was lawful? How could he be sure, for example, that the president wasn\u2019t insane?

In general I'm in favor of a progressive tax code that is fair, and by fair I mean there aren't tax exemptions (a.k.a. loopholes).  Everyone has their own favorite loophole that benefits them - as a renter I unfairly subsidize homeowners through the mortgage interest deduction.  Homeowners will of course argue for that tax exemption's merits, as this grad student is opining to keep this particular exemption.  But, it's inherently unfair.  I had to take on loans then do my own cost-benefit analysis to determine whether I should continue my education.  No one, understandably, gave me a tax break. Additionally,  we shouldn't be using the tax code to correct an educational issue.  And don't get me wrong - there is most definitely an issue with cost inflation in education.  There is a tax exemption for employer provided health benefits.  When your employer determines your cost they add up your salary plus all benefits such as your health benefits and that becomes your total compensation.  That exemption incentivizes employers to shift your total comp from salary to health benefits in order to increase your real, after-tax comp without any cost to them.  Not only does this create perverse incentives for employers but it's unfair to people who are self-employed.  All transfers in kind should be taxed, including those health benefits and these education benefits.  Otherwise, over the life of the tax code (which in the U.S. is typically 35 years or so) the accumulation of these exemptions creates an over-complicated, contrived, and perverse mess. If education isn't affordable and we want to correct that with extra grants (which, broadening the tax bass could pay for with the increase in revenue) then we need to address education's cost outside of the tax code, instead of using the tax code as a bandage for systemic problems.

The lawsuit was filed by this reporter along with a pro-transparency group, the James Madison Project.\u201cWhen the president says Mr. Comey \u2014 former director Comey \u2014 brought the dossier to me, isn\u2019t that an acknowledgement that the FBI possesses the dossier?\u201d the judge asked, referring to comments Trump made in a New York Times interview.Justice Department lawyer David Glass said the statement was still too vague to force the government to respond in greater detail to the FOIA requests and lawsuit.Much of the 40-minute hearing at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., turned on whether Trump\u2019s statements could or should be read to mean that government agencies had investigated the claims in the dossier and found them wanting.\u201cThere\u2019s no inference that is possible,\u201d Glass insisted. \u201cIt could be based on other things.\u201dAn attorney for the requesters told Mehta that, while Trump\u2019s statements might have been based on his personal knowledge or media reports, without further clarification from the White House, the court should assume the president was communicating in his official capacity based on official knowledge.\u201cHe\u2019s saying it is discredited. It has been discredited,\u201d lawyer Brad Moss said. \u201cIf the White House or whatever defendant wants to clarify it, that\u2019s their prerogative, but until that, there\u2019s a factual discrepancy.\u201dMehta responded by venturing into a subject rarely raised publicly in court: Trump\u2019s calls for Hillary Clinton to be investigated and jailed.\u201cHe\u2019s also said his opponent did break the law,\u201d the judge observed, asking whether that was Trump relaying an official Justice Department conclusion or just offering his personal opinion.When Moss suggested that the court might need to order some sort of fact-finding exercise to figure out whether the president\u2019s statements about the dossier were based on official or unofficial information, Mehta jumped in.\u201cHow do you propose doing that? Do you want to depose the president?\u201d the judge asked.\u201cAs much as I would like that, that is not necessarily something I would think is necessary at this point,\u201d Moss replied.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 43495, "comment_id": "dq08i53", "score": 72, "submission_time": "Sat Nov 18 18:55:39 2017", "ups": 72}, {"body": "This sentence should not make sense but it does ", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 832, "comment_id": "dq045jq", "score": 46, "submission_time": "Sat Nov 18 17:05:03 2017", "ups": 46}, {"body": "Jesus, just put the entire article in the title why don\u2019t you?", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 41621, "comment_id": "dq05jw3", "score": 45, "submission_time": "Sat Nov 18 17:44:13 2017", "ups": 45}, {"body": "Hahaha, that would be so delicious.

He is treating it like an organized crime investigation. With Enron, he got Andy Fastow to flip by going after Fastow's wife for tax evasion.  He's going to get Flynn to role by going after Flynn's son. With organized crime the top bosses try to maintain plausible deniability for the crimes committed by their subordinates. However, if it can be proven that the bosses ordered or otherwise knowingly assisted in committing those crimes then they can be charged for the same crimes as if they committed them themselves. The heavy emphasis of the Trump investigation on bribery/money laundering is pretty telling. My gut instinct is that Mueller is treating Trump and Co. as an organized crime family and is actively conducting a RICO investigation against them. It's not as sexy as treason or as exotic sounding as collusion, but it gets the job done.As for the pardon problem, Trump can only pardon people for federal crimes not state crimes. Fortunately, 33 states also have RICO statutes on their books. New York is one of them. As long as Mueller can prove that any crime occured through or took place in the State of New York then the state can pursue charges which the president can not pardon. Mueller has been consulting with the New York AG since the very beginning of the investigation so my guess is he is already planning on state charges having to be levied.Collusion might end up being how the Trump campain's actions are described but it is not the activity he or others will be charged with.
