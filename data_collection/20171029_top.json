Whitefish said that FEMA would reimburse them for things PREPA couldn't pay for. FEMA says nu-uh. So who told Whitefish they would be reimbursed? Whitefish also didn't ask for any money up front, which is weird. Hiring 325 people to work for a bankrupt company with no currently paying customers is stupid.

The Power of Liars ...    Winning Through Intimidation.   by Roy Masters.   Whoever controls your perception also     controls you. Beware, lest you fall prey to the Michael Moores of this world, whose craft is especially honed to cast doubt toward the innocent.     If you allow, they will act through your emotions, and turn you into instruments of your own downfall, even against your own country.    The following story is typical: While waiting for her husband to come home, Mary picks up the phone; an anonymous woman starts hinting about her husband having an affair. The caller is hesitant, even apologetic, and has what seems to be a sincere story. She speaks about having similar experiences and wishes to prevent Mary from getting hurt in the same way.    Shocked, anger wells up inside and faith in the stranger takes over. Filled with doubt toward her loyal husband, all the good in her life begins to melt away. In vain, her perplexed husband tries to find out what went wrong. He cannot. Alas, Mary also cannot tell because of the protective bond of trust with the caller. This once happy homemaker is no longer the same as before the call. Because of belief, a liar controls her destiny.    Mary now finds fault with everything the husband does or says. Unable to cope with such inexplicable madness, he rushes out to the local tavern to get drunk. There he encounters the manipulative woman on the telephone \u2013 his wife\u2019s best friend.    Failure and envy compelled this \u201cfriend\u201d to steal Mary\u2019s happiness\u2026just as the likes of Michael Moore plan to spirit away America \u2019s success and liberty.    Such lies and programming have far-reaching and even exponential personal and political implications. If all it takes is for Michael Moore to point an angry accusing finger to intimidate many into believing that he is your friend and the President is a liar and a terrorist, then Osama Bin Laden can easily top that with the threat of a big bomb.    Many, aided and abetted by the mainstream media, posing as our friends and news sources, continue to accuse our duly-elected public officials of crimes they did not commit. Their emotionally powerful bony fingers of contention have a demoralizing effect, especially on those who, like themselves, had problems with lying and cheating fathers. Such projections toward authority figures do not distinguish between who is or is not guilty.      Strong emotions stirred up by intimidation, especially when accompanied by accusations toward the innocent, cause many to lose their way and become loyal to our enemies. The false faith of doubt that induces judgment is a very deadly and exploitable addiction that portends a broken home-based political hell on earth.When people become addicted to judgment, demand calls for a steady supply of innocent victims to satisfy the accuser\u2019s cravings. Imagination feeds our silent judgments; later they are reinforced and exploited by cunning, treasonous political agitators. Many loyalists would rather die for their champion, or see us all dead, than admit they are wrong.The culture war thus lost becomes a civil war.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 878, "comment_id": "dp26pyf", "score": 1, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 29 20:28:40 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "This is click bait, Mueller has the power to bring charges to a grand jury without DOJ approval.

The reason i think this will happen is because of social media and the abiity of the populace to self organise.

And now today, the governor suddenly changes his mind and decides the contract should be cancelled?There really seem to be only two options:* The governor initially defended the deal, figuring that if the mayor of San Juan and congressional Democrats was against it, the Trump administration would be for it. Then either the Trump administration told him to stop defending it or he read the tea leaves from [Friday's story](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/27/white-house-distances-itself-from-whitefish-contract-with-puerto-rico.html) about the White House distancing itself from the deal and decided the political tides were turning the other way and jumped ship.

Or, if you have a plan available that allows you to save post-tax dollars, then you can pay the taxes today ($400), save the remaining $600, and decades later withdraw the principal and gain tax-free.Which method results in more money for you?Disregarding inflation, assuming 5% annual growth in the investment, a 20% tax bracket in retirement, and a 30 year interval between the investment and withdrawal:$1000 (pre-tax) grows to $4322 (pre-tax). The government's 20% cut is $864 and leaves you with $3458 (post-tax).$600 (post-tax) grows to $2593 (post-tax), which you get to keep all of when withdrawing in retirement. So you are almost a thousand dollars worse off than if you had saved pre-tax dollars.Alternatively, if you are in a 30% tax bracket today, your $700 (post-tax) would grow to $3025 (post-tax). So, you would lose about $400.If you are in a 20% tax bracket today, your $800 (post-tax) grows to $3458 (post-tax), the same amount as the $1000 pre-tax investment.

Adverts for Bavaria beer the very same day (and no, I never had ads for beers previously).Bought a glue gun, the most random product, in cash. Never mentioned it to anyone. Never googled it. Boom, an advert for a glue gun on Facebook (never had any similar ads previously, or after that).I've had countless other examples, but these two were the creepiest.Really, Facebook? An advert for a glue gun out of the blue? You're so full of shit!**EDIT**: I'm not at all surprised that I've been called a liar and a retard.I **hope** that it really is confirmation bias. However, almost all of the ads I receive are related to my online searches. In my case, audio production. That's completely normal and expected. The glue gun advert was completely out of place, and totally unrelated to the expected and repetitive ads that I usually receive (same goes for the beer. I am not a drinker, I don't usually buy beer, I don't see beer adverts). Judging by all the responses in this thread, including those who claim to have worked in ad agencies, it seems naive to think that this is some impossible conspiracy.Other important things I should have mentioned at the start:I was using a facebook profile with a fake name in order to manage my band's Facebook page.

That's why I am creeped out. I am 100% certain I didn't google it, and I am equally certain that my old Nokia was not (could not be) listening in on me in the shop. The only possible explanation I have is that my Macbook heard me or saw me using the glue gun. This would also imply that Apple shares private info with Facebook. Regarding the Bavaria beer - as others have pointed out, my credit card company most likely sold the information to someone, which was then forwarded to Facebook. Or, Facebook somehow has access to my purchases because I used the same cc to buy ads on Facebook. It's not difficult to believe at all, and it's not that creepy, but I am perplexed as to how this is legal.

While in the queue, over the radio there's an advert for a change in the law that requires all employers to have a pension scheme. An advert seemingly targeted at my friend and I, like the radio is *listening to us* (dun dun dun).This is patently impossible, it's a classic case of confirmation bias. Humans are two things; stupid and predictable. We forget what we've done, what we've said, what we've heard, and we leave very clear patterns in our behavior, Take targeted ads; you make never have searched for \"St Dingletons Hemorrhoid cream\" but your browsing behavior will still point towards it; which adverts you let play longer or shorter, what searches you do (\"why does my office chair hurt my bum?\" \"what are hemorrhoids?\" etc). They can even cross reference your brand loyalties; people who drink coke are more likely to eat McDonalds for (an obvious and simple) example. You only notice ads when they match your needs, *which is what targeted ads are supposed to do*. They go scattershot, using every bit of random data and pattern recognition to try and get you with what you want. But you don't notice the misses, only the hits. It's like when your friend suggests the *exact* take-away you've been craving all day. They haven't been stalking you, watching your every move and listening in. It's just a coincidence that you've noticed, influenced by subtle overlapping behaviors. But humans hate the idea of random chance, and *really* hate the idea that we're not as smart as we think we are (or that there are people/systems smarter).Here's a little experiment I've done myself; turn round to a bunch of your friends and tell them that they're going to hear/see an advert for say Cadbury chocolate (if you're in the UK). I guarantee at least one of them will come back saying they saw adverts **everywhere!** It's not because the number of adverts has changed in response to the conversation, it's just their awareness (in this case on a very obvious, surface level).

First of all, the app does not record your conversations (that's illegal if you aren't the government), so Facebook is right when they say that. What they DO, however, is have the microphone on and feeding directly into a speech-to-text engine that waits for keyword triggers which then get sent back to the servers. So for the top commenter here, the device likely only recorded the fact that he said the words \"diabetes\", \"insulin\", \"test strips\", and \"buy\", and the ad engine used those words to line up some ads. Note that recording the fact that the words were said is much different than recording him saying the words.For those of you that are still apprehensive about whether or not this is true, there is a great experiment you can do. All you have to do is make sure you have the Facebook app up to date on your phone, then turn your TV to one of the Latin channels that only speaks Spanish. Leave your phone next to the tv for a few hours, with it as loud as a normal conversation would be. Keep track of how many Spanish ads you see over the course of the next week. As an aside, I am pretty sure Skype does this as well, but I don't have enough evidence to support that claim at the moment. If they do, their engine is a little more subtle than Facebook's.edit: since this post is gaining some traction, I would like to add this little tidbit about [ultrasonic tracking](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/hundreds-apps-can-listen-beacons-cant-hear/).

With the right tools you can often observe huge surges in out bound network traffic when these app changes occur yet nothing is ever said until something bad happens.Sadly, most discoveries related to the collecting of this kind of data are never properly announced in advance of their code releases, and the public often stays largely ignorant until the damage is already done, with the company profiting off of the data they collected and the user potentially having their lives damaged by whatever might have leaked.Now in full disclosure I will say that sometimes the methods these companies use are well written, and made clear-ish within their ever-evolving (and largely one-sided) EULA agreements that nobody really reads.. But, when you look at companies like Mattel who are making web enabled \u2018toys\u2019 (targeted at little kids who cannot legally agree to EULA\u2019s), and those toys have webcams and mics integrated into them, where it\u2019s been proven that the software is often unpatchable and usually shitty open source code, its easy to see how incredibly dangerous this could be.Bottom line...  Nothing free is ever \u2018actually\u2019 free when it comes to online products and services.

But apparently still too dirty to the EPA when connected to sensitive monitoring equipment.   So every vw diesel in USA sold from 2009 to 2015 was taken off the road.
