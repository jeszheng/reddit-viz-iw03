When I was in Ireland, I worked at a radiation therapy group at Trinity. My cancer cells taught themselves how to overcome therapy. The first level of treatment in prostate cancer is to medically castrate the male until the testosterone/dht (androgen) level drops just enough to keep the cells from sustaining themselves. Those cells need androgens for a host of reasons, but namely for cell signaling and proliferation. Well, these cancer cells I had were from a patient who relapsed two years after being medically castrated. He had low level androgens yet the cancer cells were still proliferating as a tumor.  So we take a sample and we hit them with radiation. First few months they are dying slowly, and we thought we were clear on that route. But month three comes and... the cells started growing again. They started feasting on human-safe radiation levels. They were actually manipulating the natural cell response to the radiation by treating the radicals they create as signal starters. In other words, they somehow used radicals to initiate proliferation pathways that testosterone used to do. Ok, no problem. Let's try chemotherapy. We hit them with doxorubicin (common chemo). They're dying again from the poison of it. Few months in, we're clear. Until the cells which were naturally selected to overcome chemo survived. These cells had an ability to open a \"back door\" so that when the chemo enters the cell, it quickly exited the cell by over-expressed transport proteins.It's really fucking wild. Cancer cells are malignant spies of your own creation and can overcome just about anything but death. **EDIT1**: This is obviously an ELI5. A lot of you are asking how radicals cause cells to proliferate, and to that I present you our [proposed model](https://imgur.com/nfLWwSg) -- this was substantiated by a lot of experiments, namely Western blot, RT-PCR, and clonogenic assays.**EDIT2**: >Free radicals produced upon IR treatment are the primary source of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).

Everyone knows it too. I began to bring it up with the Mercedes shop guys and they all knew about it.I wish I could describe to you how bad this thing is. 1. I've had the car NEARLY STALL ON ME because it lurches so bad from a stop if you accelerate too abruptly.2. The transmission on occasion simply refuses to shift down. I'll approach and do a quick stop at a stop sign and attempt to take off, and the car will try to take off in third. What the fuck.3. It's slow. Like I get it, single clutch eco mode shit, but it's *really* slow. Down shifts are slow but for whatever reason upshifts are the slowest. It's so slow sometimes that if you're going uphill and it takes an upshift, the time until the next gear is engaged is long enough where you're going too slow for that higher gear and it disengages and goes back down.4. The paddle shifters are useless. Not really news but it's true.5. It's very very poorly integrated with the stop/start system. As the car turns back on there's no logic to tell the transmission to wait for the engine to get to speed so you get both a lurch and rough start when you try to accelerate too soon after the car starts.I'm not kidding that the transmission has nearly caused me 2 accidents.

Watching the strongest man I knew wither away in the space of a Month. Being the sort of person who didn't want to be a bother, he hid terminal Lung Cancer for **8. Fuck'n. Years.** They only reason we found out was because the next door neighbor took him into the hospital for a 'bad chest infection' along with my - by then - severely Dementia affected Nan he had been tending to for over a decade.When we were told what was happening, he had the lung capacity of a 5 year old. This tough old bastard was walking 2km to church twice a week, chopping firewood, working the hospital grounds (groundskeeper for nearly 35 years, retired but still popped through to help out) AND looking after Nan. We are a stubborn bunch, us Greedeaters.Once he realised that Nan was being looked after at the attached Elderly Care unit and that he wouldn't be coming back out of the hospital alive, he accepted it. We did the family gathering as he requested the oxygen turned off. We expected no more than a day, two at most. That's how much he had... Atrophied? Faded?He kept going for another month.Stubborn.One morning, he had his usual breakfast. Eggs Benedict, I showed him how to make it years ago and he absolutely adored it, though Nan didn't. With a bit of help from me and my brother, we helped him out of bed - the brawny suntanned forearms we used to hang off when we were toddlers now feeling like lukewarm cloth wrapped around a bundle of Spaghetti - into his chair outside, so he could look over the Hospital grounds he lovingly tended to all that time. He asked me brother and I for a few moments to himself, and to grab some brekkie for ourselves and a cuppa tea for him.We came back about 15 minutes later to see him smiling, staring at the Jacarandas he planted to celebrate my Sister's birth.It took us about 10 seconds to realise he was gone.And now I'm a 40 year old Bouncer crying in a bathroom.Edit: My thanks to peoples kind words here, I'll share my fondest memory of him to offset the maudlin. Oh, the pain is still fresh from his passing as it was only a few months ago the above occurred. I would have been about 6 or so when we visited Pop. Of course he was out back in the veggie garden, tending to his beans. Mate, these beans he grew... Used to love having dinner there just for them alone. Had a little row for us grandkids to tend to as well, was pretty sweet when we were young.Anyway, he gives the usual Cheeky grin to us as we wander up the driveway. Da, my brother and I head into the shed with Pop, my sisters and Ma head inside. Da cracks a beer with Pop - somethin we do now as adults too, straight to the shed for the beer and catch-up - and start nattering away whilst me bro and I explore the Treasure Trove that was pops shed. I can't remember *exactly* how the subject came up, but Pop bet me a prize that I couldn't pick up this massive cowbell shaped weight. Thing was a solid 20kgs (about 45 freedom units) from memory. So here's skin and bones 6yo Greedy trying to shift this bloody thing. After grunting and groaning, somehow I managed to lift it. Not by much, but enough.He gives me the eyebrow. Dad has the eyebrow too, cigarette hanging out of the lopsided grin which is a familial trait in the male Greedys. Eyebrow too, apparently, or so I've been told. He reaches behind the fridge, and pulls out an air rifle. Sam and I have never seen it before, had no bloody idea he had it at all! I found out later when I was older that he used it to piss off the possums that climbed on the roof at night.He motions me and my bro outside, and points towards the roof of the house just above the Bathroom, about 10 metres away. Y'know those old fashioned air cyclers, that look like a fat pinwheel laying down on a pipe? Can't remember what they are called, but yeh. He says to me if I can hit it with the air rifle, he'll not only give me the prize but let me and Sam practice shooting with it at the woodpile. The look my bro gave me matched my own. Heh, early 80's thrills, eh?I line it up after Pop had loaded a slug. I remember it being heavy. Hesitated, asked if it had any kick. Pop and Da laughed, told me not to worry bout that. Pop coached me on how to align the sights with the target, and squeeze *not pull* the trigger.Well bugger me sideways, I actually hit it. Not the spinny part mind you, but the pipe I guess: made a very loud *ping* that definitely wasn't the roof tiles. Noone present believed I did it, including myself. Sam broke the quiet by hissin a quiet 'yessss' under his breath a few seconds later.Jutting out his jaw in a bemused expression, Pop reloaded the air rifle and passed it to Sam. He ducks back into the shed, returning quickly. Presses a coin into my palm. Told me I couldn't spend it, but hang on to it as a momento. Then Nan came out with Ma, saw the air rifle, shit hit the fan for a few minutes.We still got to play with it after that though.I showed Da the coin when we got home later that night. He said he'll put it in the photo album so I don't lose it,and when I was older I could have it back. That was about 25 years ago when I reclaimed it, and have been carrying it with me every single day since then. Had a few scares where I thought I'd lost it, but it always turned back up, and currently sits in my coats breast pocket, or my wallet when it's too warm.What I didn't know until Da told me when I wanted to take the coin back, was that the coin was the first unit of Aussie Currency that me Pop had ever seen: he'd fished it out of the family pubs cash register back in Northern Ireland, where I'm originally from. It might have been the seed that laid the idea for coming over here in the first place. I don't know for sure, and now I never will.I like to think it was, anyway.[The coin itself.](https://i.imgur.com/QQ5IoMM.jpg)", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 127307, "stickied": false, "score": 505, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 15 19:58:13 2017", "ups": 505}, {"body": "My mom when I was  14 having a mental breakdown and didn\u2019t want to be a mom anymore.

In fact I was so nervous I just...didn't talk to her (like I said I did when I had to and I loved those moments but I didn't speak to her any other times).Anyway 7 days come to a close and I need to leave, I never found out her last name so I leave the camp horribly depressed, stupid and in love with no way of contacting this girl in any way.So I go an entire year, 365 days without seeing her.It only took me about a few weeks before I began to forget what her face looked like, and this wasn't a lack of caring thing, this is the only person this has ever happened, I don't usually just have the image of someone fade in my mind I'm generally pretty good at remembering faces.Anyway as the memory of her began to fade I felt more and more pain and despair over my situation and only about 3 months in I forgot what love felt like.I remembered it feeling good and I remembered caring about this person but the emotion it envoked in me was gone and I completely forgot about how it felt.Anyway after about 6 months I stopped caring.I still kept the thought of her in the back of my mind, but I didn't care much anymore.Anyways.A few months back the camp was on again (it's a yearly thing)I go to the youth group, and since I'm older this time it's a different one, one that doesn't separate you all into groups.So I go in and I don't see her anywhere.My heart drops and despair starting clawing at me.However.2 days in I'm in the group listening to a sermon and I look around and there she is.  A few rows behind me.Obviously having not seen her in a long time my brain goes fucking mental hearts beating harder and faster then it ever had before, like so fucking hard it nearly hurt.  My stomach gets that wierd sickly feeling where I don't want to eat but it's still a good feeling (butterflies I believe it's called) and the other emotions that come with love.Anyway that doesn't matter.The entire week I was to scared to talk to her again, this time I didn't even have an excuse.But on the last day I bit the bullet and I whent and said hi,and it was the best decision of my entire life.We spoke for like an hour, she was enjoying it and actively trying to keep the conversation going, it was great.Then she said she had to go because she had to meet people, I said ok and whent off.Now I whent to go and find her in the afternoon to get her details and stuff (there is an afternoon service everyone goes to there), but my parents, my fucking parents...decided that we needed to leave early.I wasn't able to even see her again after that conversation, nor did I find out her last name.So we're back to square one.A year of waiting.And the stress has been to much for me.Over the past few months I have been having legitimate, full on panic attacks because of this, I've been spiralling into depression, I constantly feel hopeless and empty.It's generally not a fun time.Not only that but in our conversation I found out that she's two years older then me.That's fucking right, she's 16 and I'm 14.Turns out she was a fucking minor youth leader of my group last year.Point is, I understand that the age gap is to big, and that it's not going to work, but I'm going to try anyway, I NEED the closure of at least getting rejected.Anyways...this coming year I'll have an excuse to talk to her, she knows who I am and stuff (she completely forgot about me being in her group she was a leader in) and it should go fine.The pain of being thrust away from her isn't the worst part.She said she was going through some really fucked up shit.And it's so unbelievabley painful knowing that I can't even help her with these things, she has so many insecurities and issues (she told me) and I can't even fucking help her through them.Anyway, I don't really have much else to say, sorry if it's badly written this is to long for me to be bothered to proofread.And sorry for my overuse of anyway.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7004, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 16 02:57:18 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "Wife miscarried.

For the most part he was pretty mellow but he would have these crazy fights with his girlfriend like every week. I remember one time I was sleeping in my room at night and I could hear someone trying to open my door, which was locked, I get up and look out the window and its roommates girlfriend running out the door. I open the door and I look at see my roommate and I ask him what's going on and he told me, completely somber, that they had a fight and he chased her out of the apartment. The sound of my door knob was his girlfriend trying to open up my door while running away.At this point things began to really sour between the two of us. And it was only like 6 weeks into the fucking new semester. We'd became irritated with each other little shit. We had a toilet and we had problems with flushing it. Like literally I'd take a piss and I'd flush the toilet like 4 times and it wouldn't go down. He'd brought this up to me a few times about not being a slob. I'm not going to act like I'm perfect but I'm also not going to spend 30 minutes trying to flush a toilet. It happens one day again, where I left a shit in the toilet, and I come home to a note from him on the bathroom door saying that we live in a civilized society and I shouldn't be leaving other people to clean up my mess.I was fucking incensed to say the least and I literally stayed up till the middle of the night thinking about what I wanted to do. Finally, I just wrote him a letter back chewing him out for all of the bullshit that he was bringing into the apartment with his girlfriend. I go to sleep and there is a note the next day from him apologizing about it.At this point his girlfriend has dumped him (again). So he decides to wait outside of her apartment to see if she is with someone else. She drives up with another guy, they spot him, and she asks him to keep driving. She comes back later and doesn't see him. She goes into her place. Turns out he broke and was hiding there and he starting beating the hell out of her. Tossed around and threw her through a television set. He pulls out a pair of scissors to stab her with when some people walking by the place hear the commotion and ask if everything is okay. He goes to look out the window and she uses that distraction to run for her life. She gets away and calls the police.This was like the day after he wrote me that apology note. I'm sitting in my room at our place listening to some music when, over the music, I can hear loud knocking on the front door. My door is above the front door so I look out the window and I see a campus cop standing down there. I'm confused so I go downstairs. In our living room we have a glass sliding door that we could use to walk out the back door. As I'm walking down the stairs I see two cops hiding on each end of the window, trying to not let me see them. Now I'm really confused so I answer the door and they immediately ask me which resident am I. I show them my ID and they start to ask me about my roommate. They ask if they can come in and search the place. I don't think they needed my permission, actually, but I gave it to them anyway. They searched every inch of our place looking for him. They even checked underneath my bed. They told me what he did to his ex and that nobody had seen him since. I even tried to call him to get him come back home, but he wound up taking a call from his dad who talked him into turning himself in. Next day when I came home from class, I saw his entire family at the residence packing up his stuff. He got kicked out of school and I had a two floor, two bedroom apartment to myself for like a year. A day or two later the school finally sent over a plumber and he found like a dozen of those alcohol face pads flushed down the toilet. My roommate had been flushing them and clogging the toilet up. So that all bullshit we fought over was because of him.He actually wound up being allowed to comeback like a year later and I'd still see him around campus. I found out later on that he had mental problems or some kind of mental illness. Last time I checked I think he was a teacher in England.TL;DR: My college roommate assaulted his girlfriend, possibly tried to kill her.

It's hard to just have electricity go to nothing and it's hard to pretend there's a load that can use up the pure energy a nuclear reactor puts out. Nuclear reactors do not handle adjusting their power very well and at relatively high numbers begin to poison themselves out if the level is too low. Something like 60%, I think I can't remember, reactor power causes it to be overwhelmed by it's byproducts to the point where it can't keep going and has to basically be shut down restarted after x amount of hours so that it can decay enough to not cripple the reaction. The simulated load would have to be equal to a load above poisoning levels and that's obscenely high.

However... the fuel is still hot. Really fricken hot. Without the water circulating through it constantly there could be some huge issues. I work at a CANDU reactor. We use heavy water as our heat transfer medium. One of our in case of emergency cool and poison the reactor mediums is a large eater tower that gravity feeds normal light eater into the reactor as that cools and absorbs the reactor faster than the current heavy water in it. However.. It's designed for 1 reactor messing up hard and hoping people can shut the others down (all reactors are independent system wise so that faults on one isn't faults on all 4). Another feature they have assuming 100% lack of power (no back up generators for emergencies) the system is designed to go for as long as it can on a thermal flow option... like, the hot water will flow through the system cool and return back, which they got to test in real life by accident during the black out because the faults were so bad. However it only last so long. The systems probably would never breach containment if it got too hot honestly however the plant itself would be a terrible place to be with how their systems are set up. A meltdown on the levels of what has happened with 3 mile and fukushima are interesting edge cases of poor decision or poor design. Fukushima actually caused my plant to put safeties in place in case something were to happen here... Even though we are nowhere near fault lines. Meltdowns are honestly a hard thing to judge.

Most plants built in the 60s and 70s are designed to operate with no human interaction for at least 10 minutes. And that would be during what is called a \"design basis accident\", which is some sort of large pipe break in most plants. In a situation where the plant is running fine and all the operators just *poof* disappeared, the plant would keep running normally for a while. If it lost output connection to the electric grid, the plant would automatically shutdown and maintain itself. If it lost electricity coming from the grid, the backup diesel generators would startup and provide power to emergency and safe shutdown systems. Nuclear power plants have enough diesel fuel on site to power emergency systems for at least a week at full load, so in a non emergency situation (ie  nothing breaks) probably longer than that. As for cooling water, it would depend on the plant, but every plant in the US has at least 30 days of cooling water available without makeup in an emergency situation. Of course nuclear safety systems assume that every human doesn't just up and disappear forever, but they will keep themselves cool for quite a while without human interaction. I'd imagine in this scenario  you would start seeing serious issues at nuclear power plants sometime beyond the week mark once plants started running out of diesel fuel. And even then the decay heat would be pretty low and it would take a while after before you started seeing fuel damage. My guess is most plants would eventually end up with some fuel damage without long term cooling, but it likely would be far less than something like fukushima. There would likely be some elevated doses around the plant, but I would imagine they wouldn't be life threatening. Doses would be worse if there were a hydrogen explosion inside containment like fukushima unit 2, and there would definitely be some hydrogen generation once fuel gets exposed, though as long as containment stays intact, there shouldn't be any explosion. I'd hazard a guess that the end result would suck, but pretty much all nuclear material would remain on site and environmental damage would be minimal. As for spent fuel in the spent fuel pools, eventually all the water would boil away without any makeup or cooling, but pretty much all but the most recently discharged fuel would be cool enough to not melt via air cooling. Even in fukushima, the spent fuel pools remained intact, though there was some boil off and a lot of debris in the pools. Some of the hottest spent fuel might experience damage and long term violate spent fuel pool integrity, though radioactive material would remain on-site, and the bulk of the radiation would be directed up from the spent fuel pool. Long term I wouldn't expect any major environmental damage. Everything above of course doesn't look very long term, where the plant eventually collapses and nuclear material leeches into the environment, but we would be talking likely decades before ant plant experienced major structural issues. The real take away is the longer power and therefore cooling to the environment lasts after shutdown, the less bad the end result is. For fukushima they had less than an hour of power after shutdown. In this situation you are looking at likely a week or 2 before power is lost. Even after, core cooling would remain for a while until all that water boiled away. Long term you would still see core damage and elevated doses around the site, but the magnitude would be far less than fukushima. But you are also talking about all 400+ nuclear reactors having the same issue simultaneously, so the end result would be multiplied by that number. Source: former reactor engineer, current nuclear plant operator in training. Edit: HiddenCamper is more correct. While the plant would still have power for quite a while, containment cooling is not automated and therefore containment would eventually overheat and cause system failures well before the 7 day mark. Were there an operator available to put suppression pool cooling in service, the plant could feasibly keep the core cooled automatically for quite a while as I said above, though I am assuming nothing breaks after running continuously for days and days.

Or at least have some type of port to make bigger ships since it will be easier due to the microgravity.

You can easily comment on why it's wrong, and I'd probably agree- but I believe that accurately representing your opponent's beliefs is the first step to beating them in the realm of ideas. It is important that, rather than (correctly) identifying their beliefs as racist or misogynistic, that we figure out precisely where their tribalism blinds them. I fear that they get more powerful, and start pushing for the race war that they do legitimately want. Their argument is that the \"family unit,\" especially the family in a white Christian house, is the smallest unit in politics. As opposed to Liberals and most normal people, who believe it's the individual. They believe that giving women the right to vote creates a wedge which separates families. Where we believe \"one person, one vote,\" they'd rather it be \"one family, one vote.\" Needless to say, they believe women are irrational and just as mentally capable as children, so logically the man should have the vote. When asked to justify this, they're quick to bring up graphs of average white vs black IQ or some study showing women are emotional. Even if both of these are scientific fact (which remains to be seen, for obvious reasons,) the average difference is maybe ~5 points. That's *half* the difference between whites and Jews, iirc. And it is proven fact that quality education is much more important than 5-10 IQ points. (While I acknowledge that it is fact that different race's bodies function in different proportions, it's a big leap to say 'therefore x is superior' and an even bigger to say 'we cannot coexist with y' or 'y deserves less representation.\" Anyone with a higher level of understanding, please feel free to enlighten me. Needless to say, they also minimize and belittle the role of education in society. I've read a couple manifestos and talked to a few people, and they tend to want something like a medieval guild system wherein you pass jobs down through the family, with an associate network.

Gerrymandering is an issue, but is being addressed by SCOTUS. Elections are the foundation on which everything else is built. If they aren't as fair as we can make them, then everything afterwards is a farce. My representives have basically responded to my emails in the past with \"fuck off, your vote doesn't matter to me\" in the most polite way possible, so I emailed Bob Corker, lol.\"Dear Mr. Corker,   I'm writing to you for two reasons. The first is I would like to say that it saddens me to see the vitriol that people are casting your way because you voiced some legitimate concerns about our president. The amount of negative comments I saw on your Facebook page stands in stark contrast to what I see in people everyday here in the rural suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I very rarely come across a true Trump supporter in my day to day life. Most people feel the way we do, it seems. I'm an Independent who votes by issue, rather than party and if I had the option of voting for you, I would do so in a heartbeat.The second purpose of my message is of a more serious concern. I feel like I've been seeing some news articles lately about 'billionaires' threatening to close their wallets until tax reform is done. This concerns me greatly for a couple reasons. The first is that tax reform is a major undertaking and doing so under the current political climate seems like it could result in sloppy work due to distractions. The second reason and the primary point that I'm leading to is it creates a sense of entitlement in these donors who are essentially trying to buy our politicians support for their personal agenda's, instead of these donors supporting candidates that the voters support.I would like to offer an idea I had to address this issue; Perhaps instead of addressing tax reform because the ultra-wealthy are threatening our politicians with their wallets, we as a country should start talking about campaign finance reform, to let these folks know that their wallets will no longer be a weapon they can use to shape our democracy. It's just an idea I had that I thought I'd share with you to do with however you see fit.

It's not clear on that point.2. Assuming a 5% ROR on non-money assets seems pretty questionable, and I'm not even sure I buy that as a blanket approach to money assets.3. The \"one percent\" section undermines their point a bit; \"chances are they inherited wealth,\" but they note that only 41.4% \"inherited some money.\" Well, which is it? 4. The average value of wealth inherited by the 1% is $1.5m, according to this. I suspect there are many families in the 1% with a net worth less than that, thus I feel like the mean is getting heavily influenced by a skew of inheritances from the super-rich.

Young people within the party have been calling for Democrats to stop being more economically conservative than Richard Nixon because we're not as easily scammed into ignoring rising inequality no matter how many divisive social issues the Dems champion, long as they don't affect their pocketbooks. While there's been clamour for change it's not happening and sure enough the Dems lost special elections left and right with stupid decision making - like that Ossof guy in Georgia, for whom they were just **desperately** cheering as their white-corporate saviour with his London School of Economics degree, the guy's basically Paul Ryan in centrist clothing. Yeah I bet with the millions being wasted on him by the Dems, people would look at this dude and think 'now there's a guy who can understand how it is for me working paycheck to paycheck on three part time jobs to support my children since I'm a single parent'...or at least somehow that's what the Democrats prayed people would think.Clinton needs to return to the shadows of Moria.

It's just now instead of numerous taxi-cab's just waiting on the side of the road in random places for a call taking up space/blocking traffic, there are ride-share participants who are vastly more efficient at picking up and dropping off customers due to the app's ability to provide more logistical support to both customers and participants.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 196657, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 16 04:16:21 2017", "ups": 5}, {"body": "Who knew shitty taxi services were the only thing protecting the world from this evil.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 560, "stickied": false, "score": 63, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 15 23:48:08 2017", "ups": 63}, {"body": "This should be a wake-up call for public transport organisations everywhere.For my wife and I to commute into the city where we work from the suburb we live, it costs approximately 2x as much to use the public bus system than it does to just drive or uber, and would take approximately twice as long to commute.When public transport is slower, less convenient and more expensive than driving/ubering why would anyone use it?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 614, "stickied": false, "score": 100, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 16 01:02:01 2017", "ups": 100}], "url": "https://www.planetizen.com/features/95227-new-research-how-ride-hailing-impacts-travel-behavior", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "I have Verizon Wireless and have opted out of all of the options on their account privacy page a long time ago (at least a year), but I still show up in these tests.What recourse do I have?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 12300, "stickied": false, "score": 65, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 15 19:59:26 2017", "ups": 65}, {"body": "Neither of the links in the article work for me.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 231787, "stickied": false, "score": 17, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 15 20:29:20 2017", "ups": 17}, {"body": "For the lazy:\u2022 In December of 2013, AT&T announced their \u201cMobile Identity API\u201d, available only through an enterprise contract with AT&T.

He and I have been divorced a while now, and I had assumed that he would be too antisocial to ever date again. But he found somebody.They look like they might already be engaged, and, based on my interactions with him, I would bet he has pushed her to get pregnant. (I was the frigid bitch who denied him the option of having a child.)My time with him was absolutely horrible. He basically did everything but hit me. And between his tantrums and blow-ups, he interspersed enough calm to lull me into thinking that he wasn't the psychopath that he is. I am certain that he would not have been happy until he completely ruined my life. And when he was done, he would have blamed the whole thing on me.My first reaction to seeing the picture was, \"Oh good. He found somebody else to focus on.\" My second thought was, \"Oh god. The next ten years of her life are going to suck.\"My heart just breaks for this woman. I feel so bad for her. They were all smiles in the picture, but I imagine he has already started grooming her. I remember the specific escalation in the fights that he and I had and his calm, almost delighted demeanor, as he ripped my heart apart. I can't make her choices for her. I can't stop it. So, if you're out there, and you've just gotten engaged to the love of your life (and of course he is smart, handsome, well-spoken, and ever the professional; perfect on paper), here were a few of the warning signs that I ignored:- In the first fight, he questioned my commitment to him. I ended up crying hysterically for an hour and trying to prove that I was not a slut.- In the second fight (which occurred about a year later), he stormed out of a restaurant without paying because the food didn't arrive fast enough. He screamed at me for not being a team player because I wanted to wait for the waiter to come back to close out our tab.- When I decided that I was through with him, he broke down into tears and said that he was sad that his personality was driving me away. That was the only time I ever saw him cry, and I was dumb enough to believe him and take him back.Those were big fights. We would almost break up, but, he would come crawling back and we would work through them, with him promising to be more flexible, and me promising to help meet him halfway. In our ongoing daily life, he was almost always a fun, happy-go-lucky guy. He was so funny. Smart. We used to have these fabulous conversations and try new, exotic restaurants. But, there were little signs that he was going to get worse:- He blamed me for stuff that wasn't my fault. Not big things. But stuff like not cleaning the kitchen sink when he had said he would do it. I just thought, \"He is nuts. He said he was gonna do it.\" And I let it go. But he never stopped believing that all of those things were my fault.- He would drive too fast if we were in a hurry. He was an incredibly aggressive driver. - He pushed me to be closer to his friend's wives. He REALLY wanted me to only hang out with them, but what he said was, \"They're just really awesome people. Why would you hang out with anybody else?\"- He had interpersonal issues at work. When called in by HR to explain, he always twisted it around and got out of it.- On the way home from social gatherings, he would review the things that I had said and tell me why people took those things the wrong way and offer suggestions for future social gatherings. He would always wince at something I had said as if it would ruin his relationship with his other friends. I thought that he was overreacting, and I ignored it. But of course, in hindsight, I realize that he was trying to make me doubt myself.- He was incredibly suspicious of anybody except his close friends and family. At first it was just, \"Are you sure you want to trust him?\" but then it became, \"You are stupid to trust any of these people and you should not hang out with them ever again.\"- He would interrupt my stories about my day at work to question why I handled things that way that I did. \"Why did you tell your boss XYZ?\" \"Why would you make your coworkers think ABC?\"- If he got agitated (which happened for random reasons that I was never able to predict), he would deliberately say incredibly hurtful things. He would apologize later, after the storm was over, but eventually the apologies stopped, and the agitation was all the time.- He was ALWAYS calm when he was angry. He always treated me like a student or an employee. He never yelled. Never got flustered. Every line was delivered with precision and designed to get me to change my behavior. He would become increasingly insistent if I pushed back on him, and he would scoff at my reasoning. - He talked a LOT about us being a team. He was quick to make me his \"family.\" I thought it was endearing that he felt so much allegiance to me. Instead, he was imposing on me obligations to follow his lead.Between all of these incidents, we made love, we made dinners, we built a life together. But, the behavior escalated. And by then, he had done things that were much more damaging than just a few fights.I can't imagine this post would make a difference for anybody. But, maybe for somebody out there who just had a wonderfully romantic courtship with a guy who got left behind by his awful, horrible, selfish wife, a few of these lines will give you pause for consideration. Remember: He is handsome and smart and everything you have ever wanted in a man. And he is currently doing a really good job of sweeping you off your feet. All of that is an act, and it is really hard to get away from a man like that when you have two kids and a massive mortgage (did I mention that he isn't good with money either?).TL:DR My ex's new wife is in for a hard time.

Living with another person makes economic sense because the added cost of a second person's utilities is pretty low (your heating, electricity, and internet bills are going to stay largely the same, really water is the only thing that should take a big jump if you're both taking separate showers and washing more dishes and laundry) and the amount that second person saves by not paying separate rent and utilities is large.

Then what is he whining about? You don't say you're married so I'm guessing he's just your BF at this point.

Living with another person makes economic sense because the added cost of a second person's utilities is pretty low (your heating, electricity, and internet bills are going to stay largely the same, really water is the only thing that should take a big jump if you're both taking separate showers and washing more dishes and laundry) and the amount that second person saves by not paying separate rent and utilities is large. He may be paying more money overall, but the amount of extra money he's paying for you (utilities) is probably less than the amount of extra money you are paying for him (all the food). Which isn't to say this is an unfair arrangement. You're getting that nice financial benefit of not paying your own rent and basic utilities, so it's a savings for both of you. If he weren't being a dick about $50 a month, I'd say it was a pretty sweet arrangement for everybody. The fact that he's making such a big deal out of such a small amount of money, when you're not even spending it on luxury items but setting it aside for the future when maybe you will *both* need it, strikes me as not only rude AF but also kind of a red flag? After all, if you have no money saved up and spend as much as you make, you'll never be financially secure enough to leave him if you want to.
