There was the feeling of a slight glistening of sweat along the front of his forehead, as Barry O approached.As Barack got closer his strides got a little bit longer.  A little more confident.  A little more \"African\".Then, upon entering Donald's personal safe space, he stopped right in front of his face.  And then, raising his hand like a father would to his child, Barack reached into his pocket and pulled out a handkerchief.  White.  Just like Donald liked 'em.  And he pulled it across Donald's forehead, careful not to wrangle the eloquent combover Donald spent decades perfecting.  Wiping that glistened sweat from Donald's furrowed brows, Obama brought it close to his lips and kissed it every so gently.  Then, reaching towards Donald's pants, Barack put the handkerchief in Donald's pocket.  And in doing so, he leaned into the big man's ear and whispered \"this is all yours, Donny Boy.  Your the countries' big boy now.\" And stuffed it in Donald's pocket in such a way that the handkerchief and his penis touched gently, tip-to-tip.  The sensation caught Donald off-guard, as he pulled his hips back.  No item nor any person had touched his special place in years.  The thrill was exhilarating.Yet, Barack wasn't done.  Still leaning in, he continued to whisper to Donny Boy \"it's true.  It's all true.\" then switched to Swahili, when he said \"Gari langu linaloangama limejaa na mikunga.  Let's call this '44 and a half.'\"  He then looked Donald right in the eyes, and gently nestled his cheek with the back of his hand, and proceeded to lean in and kiss him on the lips.  \"is this really happening?  What are these feelings i'm feeling?  Is this my life now?  Have I been living a lie?\"  These were questions Donald would now have to tackle himself.  thoughts that were flying in his head as Barry O's lips were pressed up against his.

There was the feeling of a slight glistening of sweat along the front of his forehead, as Barry O approached.As Barack got closer his strides got a little bit longer.  A little more confident.  A little more \"African\".Then, upon entering Donald's personal safe space, he stopped right in front of his face.  And then, raising his hand like a father would to his child, Barack reached into his pocket and pulled out a handkerchief.  White.  Just like Donald liked 'em.  And he pulled it across Donald's forehead, careful not to wrangle the eloquent combover Donald spent decades perfecting.  Wiping that glistened sweat from Donald's furrowed brows, Obama brought it close to his lips and kissed it every so gently.  Then, reaching towards Donald's pants, Barack put the handkerchief in Donald's pocket.  And in doing so, he leaned into the big man's ear and whispered \"this is all yours, Donny Boy.  Your the countries' big boy now.\" And stuffed it in Donald's pocket in such a way that the handkerchief and his penis touched gently, tip-to-tip.  The sensation caught Donald off-guard, as he pulled his hips back.  No item nor any person had touched his special place in years.  The thrill was exhilarating.Yet, Barack wasn't done.  Still leaning in, he continued to whisper to Donny Boy \"it's true.  It's all true.\" then switched to Swahili, when he said \"Gari langu linaloangama limejaa na mikunga.  Let's call this '44 and a half.'\"  He then looked Donald right in the eyes, and gently nestled his cheek with the back of his hand, and proceeded to lean in and kiss him on the lips.  \"is this really happening?  What are these feelings i'm feeling?  Is this my life now?  Have I been living a lie?\"  These were questions Donald would now have to tackle himself.  thoughts that were flying in his head as Barry O's lips were pressed up against his.

The mass of the sun is 1.98855e30 kg, so the total amount of atoms is approximately 1.98855e30 / 2.917e-27 = 6.817e56 atoms.0.077 ppb of these are Uranium atoms, so 7.7e-9% (=0.077 ppb) of 6.817e56 is 5.249e46 uranium atoms. This is equal to 8.716e22 moles of uranium. The molar mass of uranium is 238.0289 g/mol, so the number of grams of uranium is 2.075e25 grams, or in kilograms: 2.075e22 kg.This is about 28% of the moon's mass. It's more than 1.5 x the mass of Pluto. This is, of course, nothing compared to the sun's total mass, but it is definitely not negligible. It is nearly impossible that all these atoms go through the entire sun's lifetime without at least a part of them taking part in a fission reaction. And next to that, there are other fissile elements, like thorium, that can also be found in the sun.So, to answer the question: yes, fission does take place in the sun.

Much to his disappointed face, but it's OK he can just look at her legs instead.When she got up to wait to exit the train after a few stops he proceeded to do the same of her standing body. Looking her up and down constantly until she left. It was disgusting to witness him so overtly objectifying her. Clearing his throat and licking his lips. As soon as she got off I caught his eye.

I doubt it will have a lasting affect, but I can safely say he left with a very ashamed look on his face.As a young woman myself who has had enough of some humans feeling they can get away with this kind of objectifying and just straight out impolite behaviour (in more extreme incidents I have stepped in to get women out of a violent or volatile situation or explained the process for how to take next steps with police etc or just made sure they were ok)... I wish I could have felt comfortable standing up and giving him a right earful of what I thought of his train etiquette. But I think I managed to get my feelings across without disturbing anyone else's morning commute ;) how English of me :p someone please get his parents on the line, some re eduction is in order.

I've seen a few posts on here about investigations and trauma and all the horrible stuff that comes with assault. I've used the search function to try to find other survivor stories but haven't been too lucky. I'm sure there are many other women (and men) who might be in a similar position, whether it's looking for support or advice or just knowing that you're not alone. So, what's your story? Did you report it? How long did the investigation take? How much \"evidence\" did you have? Did s/he get arrested? How are you doing now?--Here's my story: I was raped almost six months ago. I got an exam at a local hospital the next morning. While traumatic, the ladies there were really great. I had an advocate with me the whole time and the SANE nurse was amazing and gentle. I was on my period when the rape occurred and had a menstrual cup in. The pain was really intense. I haven't been able to use the cup since then because it reminds me of that night. After the hospital, two detectives came to my house. They asked a lot of questions, obviously. They commented on how much alcohol I had on my shelf in the kitchen (about 5 bottles of fancy liquor - nothing that excessive). They asked how drunk I was the night before, *exactly* how much I had to drink and at what time, how much I usually drink. They needed me to go through everything in excruciating detail. They went into my room, took my clothes. Took pictures of the blood on my comforter and took that too. They were with me for about an hour and a half before leaving. After a review of the information, I was assigned a detective. He assured me that I had enough proof and that he wouldn't take a case if there wasn't a chance. For reference, the only \"proof\" I had is a text. I sent \"I told you not to fuck me\" to which he responded \"I'm sorry\". Again, I had to go through all the details with the detective and his partner. About two weeks after it happened, we did a confrontation call. I called him on speaker with the detective recording it and asked for clarification on what happened that night and why he didn't listen to me, hoping he would admit that I didn't want it and apologize. He didn't. He said it was consensual, that I enjoyed it. That he had a good time and knew I did too. I was crushed. I couldn't drive home I was shaking so much. I haven't heard from my detective since that day, about five and a half months ago. Not sure if this is normal, but the waiting is killing me. I want all of this to be over.

As a woman entering the medical field, I figured I'd face some amount of sexism, but up until today it was mostly limited to people assuming I'm in medical school to become a nurse (nothing against nurses, but it's a different profession).This month I have a daily lunch lecture with the 2 other students at this hospital, and each day the lecturer has been someone new.Today I arrived to the lecture a little early and the instructor was there already. He asked what I've been up to these days. I started with \"um\" (because that's a very broad question and I wasn't sure if he was talking about school or the hospital or socially or what...) anyways he interrupted me to say \"typical woman, always starting with 'um'\".I was definitely taken aback 1) because I was not expecting such a rude interruption and 2) because I've never heard that stereotype before. I wasn't sure who this guy was (he could be someone who will determine my grade) so I couldn't totally call him out, but I did say \"because I'm gathering my thoughts, I don't like to speak until I know what I'm going to say.\"To which he responded \"coward.\"I texted the other (male) students, so they knew what happened as they walked in. The lecturer then asked each of them similar broad questions about what they wanted to do after school. One of them intentionally started each response with 'um'. The asshole lecturer didn't say anything about it.Oh and then at the very end when he was getting up to leave, he smirked and winked at me.My thoughts:1. That was a terrible first impression from that guy, I immediately hated him. Anything he tried to teach during that hour was lost on me, not a good way to gain an audience.2. Anyone who believes that thinking before speaking is a sign of cowardice is a fool. Being certain and confident of your words before you say them is a sign of wisdom in my book.3.

In my experience, law enforcement officers aren't really great at explaining the legal challenges and requirements in order for the State to file charges.  Most importantly, it is imperative to convey that none of this is the victim's fault and the victim did nothing wrong and make sure that the victim has access to any potential resources they need. Our system is not perfect and while it may not seem right, accused individuals have rights too that prosecutors have an ethical obligation to uphold. I cannot count the number of cases where I absolutely believed an individual committed a crime, but ultimately could not file charges because there simply was not enough admissible evidence to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.  I would encourage you to reach out to your local prosecuting attorney/district attorney's office and request to meet with the prosecutor who made the decision not to file.

I need some advice on how to find good things that last. I feel like I'm losing all my self-confidence, drive and hope for the future, because of the way things have been going for me in the last year.Exactly one year ago, I was sad after a fling that ended badly when I met my very special other. To this day, it's the most meaningful relationship I've had, it lasted for 6 months, but it was totally disfunctional: he was depressive, had anxiety, couldn't even get it up, and took it all on me, despite all being very good in the beginning. I was a mess when it ended and didn't believe I'd meet someone again.Somehow I did met this guy, who was very different, relaxed, fun to be around. We didn't have as much in common in terms of hobbies, but we really hit it off, sex was great, we spent all the time together. I discovered some parts of me I wasn't aware of, I learned a lot from him, I fell in love again and life was just going great. I also moved out from my parents house, on my own, and was enjoying my new life.2 months of dating later, he started becoming more and more distant. I tried to make it work, talked with him, but it was useless. Last night he dumped me in my own kitchen, saying he was never happy with me and he couldn't get attached to me.So here I am now, with a streak of 3 failures in love, one shittier than the other. With very little money - my job sucks and I've started looking for a better one with no results so far. And also living in a very bad place - the bed is so uncomfortable that I need to sleep on the floor, the owner won't change it, and I don't have money for a new one or to move to a new place. The heating is also really bad and it's always cold. My parents are super disappointed in my, because I am 27, I have a shitty job, no boyfriend, no real money and everybody else's kids are so much better off. My friends are all busy with their lives - they are supportive, but I barely see them.I go to therapy and my therapist keeps telling me to look at the bigger picture, that I made lots of progress, that one year ago I was dating a lunatic and this guy, who dumped me now, is a normal person and the fact that it didn't work out doesn't mean I'm a failure or there is something wrong with me that makes nobody want me for keeps (as I believe). He said it's a good sign that I have the capacity to be with someone normal and nice, so I should just keep moving forward and I'll meet someone else. He also encouraged me to take some programming courses so I can have more options job wise, and better paid than my current job.I honestly feel my therapist is just trying to put a positive light on a mountain of failures just to make me feel better and to be nice. It's so humiliating not to have a good bed to sleep in, in the beginning I cracked jokes about it, but it's plainly bringing me down to sleep on a floor just so my back won't hurt in the morning. And although I saw it coming, I feel completely crushed by the fact that this guy told me he was never happy with me, that he only pretended, and that he could never get attached to me and have feelings. He really looked and behaved as a happy person, we were together all the time. I don't know how I got from the person he loved being around to someone he dreaded spending time with. And I asked him, and he gave me some lame excuses...TL;DR: Wherever I look around me - love life, work, family, friends - I only see failure, loneliness and only reasons to feel like I wanna die. I don't know what to do to get better at life. I really want to change, to do things better so things last. I really try all the time and it's not working.

As for shit friends I recommend finding some new ones. Do you have any acquaintance you think is cool af? Ask them to hang out. Everyone needs more friends and if they say no fuck them. I think it's really cool to put yourself out there. Awkward but cool. 5. Another cliche thing everyone goes on about: pick up working out if you don't already. Go for long walks and try running as much as you can. Nothing helps more than a good sweat. Also play angry music you will feel empowered. It will help you sleep better too. 6. As for the bed get a super comfy mattress pad. 7. Find out what's good about you and focus on those. Go meet new people. Go try new things.

I've posted the content below edits and all.I (young female customer) witnessed a supervisor (male) physically intimidate a young employee (female.) He is a repeat offender.I visited this store to receive a service. I am pretty good friends with a young woman that works there (let's call her Lucy). I go to the counter and request said service and shop around a bit while I wait. The store was quite busy. I was returning to the counter to check on my service and from a distance I see Lucy run to the employee break room, crying and visibly upset. I follow her and open the door to the break room to see if she was okay. NOTE: the public restroom is in the same room as the employee break room.Lucy was still crying and said \"I don't know why He (supervisor, let's call him Lloyd) acts like this towards me. It only makes things harder on us.\"She said that Lloyd always talks down to female employees and that she couldn't take it much longer. Lucy said that another coworker, Samuel, met with HR yesterday to discuss how Lloyd has been continuing to bully and harass female employees. Samuel says Lloyd never harasses male employees.At this point, Lloyd comes over to the break room and says \"You need to leave,\" and points me away from the break room door. I step back, the door closes, and I turn to the male coworker, Samuel, and tell him \"you should probably go in there so she is not alone. I can't go in there because I don't work here.\" Samuel was obviously intimidated and did not go in.I return to the counter to request my service. It is about 10 feet from the break room. I then hear Lloyd screaming from behind the closed door and I could make out every word he was saying. He was saying something along the lines of \"Why are you back here?\" \"OH, THAT is what you consider rude? I'll show you rude!\" The store was still busy. At this point I turn to Samuel and ask \"are you going to go in there?\" He doesn't reply. So I go to the break room, open the door and see her backed into \"U\" shaped corner (table and desk on either side of her, lockers behind her, she had her pressed against the lockers) , he was 3-4 feet away from her, looming over her, finger pointed in her face, body tense and aggressive, and he was blocking the exit. She was still crying and visibly afraid.I said, very calmly \"you need to lower your voice and get a manager in here for this discussion or you need to come out and have it where you have witnesses\" At this point, Lloyd flips out and starts advancing on me, pointing to me violently \"You need to leave. You need to leave now, you need to GET OUT.\" I said while I was retreating, \"I want to speak to a manager.\"He said \"I AM the manager of this department.\" Still advancing on me, me still retreating down an isle. He was literally lumbering and red in the face. I was terrified at this point.I turn and walk briskly to the front of the store near the store exit and say loudly I wanted to see the manager. The worker retrieved the manager, all the while Lloyd advancing on me saying, \"You need to leave, I will call the cops, you do NOT want this on your record. I WILL call the cops if you don't leave.\". I was alarmed and about to walk out the door but the manager approaches me at this point and asked what was going on.Samuel starts recording the encounter.I told the female manager exactly what I've posted here and that Lloyd should not talk to anyone that way, that Lucy was visibly scared and he was threatening her and now me. I never raised my voice. All the while he was yelling \"This is not your place. I did not raise my voice to Lucy. You're only saying that because she is your friend. Who are you to come in here and tell me what to do?\" I told him I would step in for anyone in this situation, even a stranger. Even if it were a male employee. I wasn't going to stand by and let someone be berated and physically intimidated while backed into a corner.He said, \"I can speak to my employees however I want.\" (On video).What should I do? The manager said she was \"Taking care of it,\" when I called after leaving the store. Should I contact corporate HR? Who do I need to talk to to document this? I don't want Lucy or Samuel to lose their jobs. and I don't want anyone (especially young women) to have withstand his hostility. What do I need to do to protect *MYSELF* after his threats of getting the police involved when he was the one accosted me??I was shocked.Edit: clarity.(1) I did NOT go in to the break room. I opened the door to the break room. Regardless, the break room is also where the public restroom is.(2) I complained to the manager and she said she was \"taking care of it.\" Should I contact corporate? (3) there absolutely is a law against supervisor physical intimidation. It is especially bad because Lloyd has a history of harassing women (which Samuel filed a complaint for). [\"Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.\"](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm)(4) Lloyd said I had to leave, but Lloyd's manager reiterated that I could stay.

I can't wait to be married to the love of my life, my best friend. But almost immediately after the news, the wedding anxiety began to set in.Let me start by saying that I don't really care for weddings. I never have. It's just a personal thing, there's certainly nothing wrong with them, but they've just never been *my* thing. Never dreamed about a wedding as a little girl, never cared about wearing a pretty white dress. I was so adamant about my disinterest that for a while I was completely against getting married at all. Eventually (and after meeting my current partner) I came to the realization that I did want to be married. I just wasn't into weddings.Well, now I'm faced with planning one.To be clear, I'm going to have a lot of help. My mother, sister, mother-in-law to be and my fiance have all expressed great interest in planning it out. It's even been offered that I can just hand them the reins and let them come to me for opinions when a decision needs to be made. Honestly, I am very lucky to have such great support. Because I have such a huge amount of anxiety (and because a lot of focus is on the bride) I do think I'm going to stay involved enough to maintain some control over how it all goes down, but still, that helps a lot.However, there's the matter of the guest list.No family is perfect and mine is no exception. There's been drama in my extended family through the years and just recently I witnessed how that can effect a wedding when my cousin got married over the summer. Two of my uncles are divorced, and one of them likely would not have attended if his ex was invited...except it was their daughter getting married, so he kinda had to. My other divorced uncle, my bachelor uncle and my grandmother all threatened not to attend when the other ex-wife received an invitation. It was a horrible position to put my cousin in. Yes, her uncle was the blood relation, but she had known the ex-wife, her aunt, for just as long. I understood why she wanted to invite both of them. And if she had opted not to, that might have offended their three children (our cousins) into not attending either, because their mother wasn't welcome.So now it's my turn to try and wade through the drama. If I invite my aunts, I lose a number of relatives who will refuse to attend. If choose not to invite my aunts, I fear offending their children, and my aunts, to the point of broken relationships, because it would seem like such a slap in the face.What should I do?
