Just spent hours upon hours playing with boards and eqs and compressors and all kinds of fun stuff.  I play it off really well.  When it comes to band practices, I just want to be able to understand what I'm saying.  Don't care about quality so much.  Bassist (at the time) owned the board we used for practice at this point in time.  All I ever really did was poke at volume and gain so I could hear myself without feedback.  9/10 times we played shows, I didn't have to run sound.  I usually ran sound for shows I wasn't playing.  So, fast forward a few months.  I come off as a bit of a know-it-all (MBTI defines me as an INTJ if that says anything), so he is steady and constantly trying to tell me how this works and how that works and the dynamic behind this gear and that thing.  Everytime, and it's basic knowledge stuff he's spouting at me, but he seems to think he's teaching me because, I will say \"yeah, I know how that works.\"  Conversation should be over at that point.  Nope.  He goes on and on and on.  And I just tune out, text on my phone, etc, \"yeah. uh-huh.\"  Irked him a bit, but I had already told him, \"I KNOW.\"  Guy seriously thought I didn't know thing one about music equipment.  So, fast forward a few months, we have to take the PA to a show.  He helps set it up.  Do a quick test.  Ok, we have signal to the board, we have output to the speakers.  Groovy.  Wait for the first band to set up, and we'll be good.  Bassist has already told me earlier in the week that he wasn't going to be too thrilled because he would be at the board most all the day.  And I said, \"You?  What about me?!\"  We had already agreed I was gonna run the board except when I played, but he was trying to take control.  Bassist, \"Yeah, but...it's my gear and I just think it would be better if I did it.\"  I gave him the look equivalent of, \"Ha.  OKAY.\"  2 years of \"I'm gonna get high and turn knobs for a minute and then zone out\" vs 13 years of relentless labor.  First band soundcheck.  The only reason there was a soundcheck was because bassist could not be found, and I called the guys to start running through things.  Get everyone leveled and even, \"OK, whenever you're ready, I'll mix you guys more as you go.\"  Bassist ran back to the board around the time the second guitarist was being leveled out and he saw I was under control so he just stood back and watched.  When they played as a full band, he tried to look like he knew what he was doing by standing about 4 feet away from and between the speakers (that's a no-no to be that close to gauge, everything through the speaker is going to get mixed up with the amps and natural sound on stage.)  He, however, just has a \"what the fuck is he?!\" look on his face and then just nods at me.  I give a thumbs up and in my mind I'm saying \"fuck yourself.\"  I go and do a proper check by standing at the back of the room and everything sounds great.  Until a guitar gets squeaky and I see bassist poking at the board.  I go back, set it right, and say \"they're good until they ask for something.\"Fast forward to later in the night.  I've mixed 4 bands and 6 acoustic acts at this point and now it's time for my first band to play.  I ask my bassist (who is in the 2nd band for reference) if he has things.  \"Yeah, buddy.  I've got it!\" We sounded god damn terrible.  Vocals kept feeding back.  Could not hear shit through the monitors.  Drums sounded like mud.  When I wrap up, I don't even ask what happened he just tells me \"I wish your vocalist knew how to hold a microphone.  It kept feeding back and I tried to compensate for it.\"  Granted, mic-cupping does cause issues with the vocal-mix, but it can be maneuvered.  And without having to mess with anything else.  It was just fucking awful.  I mixed the band that followed us and had everything fine again and it kept that way for the rest of the night.  The bands and acoustic guys thanked me for the work.  Bassist was perched over me most the whole time this happened.  They would say \"thank you for the work, man.  Sounded great up there!\" (extends hand for shake)  Bassist, \"THANKS, BRUH.  WE'RE TRYIN OVER HERE.\"  And I just smile, shake their hand, tell em that I look forward to working with them again.  Anytime \"we\" ran sound after that, I did all the work while the bassist got drunk at the bar and made an ass of himself while blowing himself up to be some sort of musical gift from god.

This is going to be long. Sorry. I'm awake here at 3 a.m. with  a toddler and an ear infection and Paw Partol, so I've got a lot to say right now LOL. Anyway....My husband is a trucker. I am also very opinionated about it. Call me bias if you want. He says merging is a big problem with \"four wheelers\". Smaller cars can speed up, slow down, and/or move over to let others in. Semis can't move that fast and if they slow down, it takes a bit for them to speed back up and can impede traffic behind them. Most of the time they aren't being dicks and *not* \"letting you in\". You have to understanding there 70+ feet (more if doubles or triple trailers) of vehicle that has to pass you by the time you get to the end of the merge lane or ramp. And if you're just hanging out, expecting a semi to do the work for you; bad news, you're SOL. There may even be a car hovering on the driver side that you can't see that is making it impossible for him to move over.  If you're neck and neck and you're staring at his steer tires, chances are once again, he's not *not* \"letting you in\". At that point you need to speed up and get in. Now here's where the other problem lies. People think he was being a dick so now they're going to merge and slow down and play a stupid game of chicken with 90,000 pound anal probe. I don't have to go into much detail you seen the videos.And if they need to merge, move because they can't.  Also, some semis are now equip with a system called OnGuard. It's a system that detects lane drift, following distance and auto braking. The system was on another truck of my husband used to drive and it scared the crap out of him. And honestly it scared me. I'll tell you why in a second. So this brings up another comment about the merging... it detected any vehicle 300 ft in front and would adjust the truck's speed according to what the person in front of them was doing. So if you're trying to merge and the person in front of *him* is slowing, you now have 3 parties to deal with to \"let you in;\" the semi, OnGuard and now the person in front of him.If anyone cut in front of the semi the OnGuard system would apply brakes HARD. Sometimes the merge would be beautiful and the system would register it as threatening. In snow and ice the system would jab the brakes. It would put it into a jackknife but try to correct itself. I hated him driving that truck especially in the winter. I'm glad he doesn't work there anymore. Plus he says he missd the art of trucking....the gear floating and the paying attention not have any computer doing it for you. Really feeling like you're piloting a large vehicle.Another thing that bothers me is absurd comments about how semis *shouldn't be allowed on the freeways.* That is laughable. They have every right to use the highways. They have restrictions on what roads they can and cannot be on. If everyone was more educated about semis, lane travel, restrictions, regulations and things they may or may not do that you need to expect, it would make a lot more sense why you THINK they drive like assholes.

Hope it's useful.As someone who drives for a living here are some things I notice on the road and some pieces of advice.1. The leftmost lane is for passing. There should be very few instances where you are hanging out in the leftmost lane for normal travel. Those include: a closure of a lane, moving over to make room for a police officer whom has pulled someone over on the right or a stopped vehicle which is being serviced. There are others but the point is that it's not for traveling...it's for passing. I can't stress this enough. Pass on the left, and move back to the right ASAP. If you aren't, your are simply causing traffic.It is important to note that if you are being passed, don't be offended or take it as a knock to you pride...believe me people do. It simply means someone is traveling slightly faster than you, nothing more. It does not warrant a deathstare, obscene gestures, turning on your brights, or tailgating..if you think it does then you have issues.1. Keep in mind that commercial vehilces often (almost always) have a mph limit on them. If you see a truck that is going slow, they are either carrying really expensive product or they are literally at the maximum speed they can travel (and usually both).2. Commercial vehicles will often travel in the middle lane for a reason. It is simply untrue that commercial vehicles are restricted to the rightmost lane. The reason why is that it is much more difficult for a large truck to maneuver over to make room for merging traffic. On busier highways, most drivers feel much more comfortable in the middle lane as a courtesy to people entering the freeway from their right while also leaving a lane for people to pass on the left.3. Commercial vehicles and trucks are carrying extra weight and stopping short is a recipe for disaster. In most cases, it isn't technically your responsibility (by law) but be aware of where you are in relation to a truck because that's how you drive safely.Directly next to a truck for extended periods of time is not only uncomfortable for you but also for a truck driver. Again, it's up to you but avoiding being directly adjacent to a truck on either the left or right is usually a good idea. It's not impossible to see things directly adjacent to me, but my only reference point is my side view mirrors as I do not have as many view points as a pedestrian vehicle...it's funny the first obstacle for me when becoming a truck driver was adjusting to having no rear window. Duh!You should absolutely avoid tailgating trucks at all costs. If you can't see my side view mirrors, I cannot see you at all behind me.That's what I can think of for now but I'm sure there is more.Edit: spelling and grammar. Pardon my formatting I'm on mobile. If you have any burning questions feel free to ask. I love to keep our roads safer and more efficient!Edit2: well I'm off to bed. I have to be up at 4am to start my day and I wanna be well rested.

For some reason we thought that if we removed the stake he would spring to life and attack us, so we prepared all of our spells and weapons, removed the stake and... nothing.Since he didn't attack us, we decided to cut off his head, put it in a sack and burn his heart on a flaming sword along with his body.

I played the bard. This random bathing scene took us 3 irl hours to do before moving on.Party consisted of a mousefolk bard and his winter wolf mount, wood elf trickster cleric, a dwarf barbarian and water nymph monk (npc).Both bard and cleric are vain, cleric doesn'tlike getting mud on him to the point of casting waterwalking even with boots of waterwalking and me cleaning fur regularly.We spent a month lost in some nightmarish cursed swamp killing whatever came at us; did get a tabaxi sorcerer join us figured another lost soul wouldn't hurt and it gets brought up by the winter wolf that everyone smells worse than an orge's jockstrap...Dwarf powers ahead and called out that his found a dry solid clearing. I follow and trip over a submerged branch and get covered from head to tail in swamp mud. Cleric starts laughing, I throw a blob of mud at him it lands on his focus (shield with a mirror finish) and it turns into some childish bickering.Monk suggests we all go bathe, I point out we have no methods of collecting or heating water other than waterskins, flint & steel, scared flame and fireball and I bought two cakes of soap... now one and a half cakes due to winter wolf. Cleric brings up that they can cast create water, he just needs LOS to the target at all times. Bard becomes very nervous and off-handly brings up a story from his bardic college days...Cue the DM trying to ship our two characters together, much to both players objections..A few social rolls later, the party splits up but maintains shouting distance. Cleric and barbarian wander off together, monk does her nymph thing a summons a water spirit and I'm digging through my pack to swap clothes and figuring out how to clean with a cake of soap and a waterskin... things click into place and I realise that I can cast presidigation cantrip on myself and my winter wolf (however its spelt) and fur goes all clean and shiny. My character starts squeaking all happy and excitedly, winter wolf huff unamused and rolls their eyes.DM starts laughing and calls out roll perception.

DM points out that I can tell that the party is surrounded by figures and that a gloved hand covers my mouth and a dagger pressed to my ribs.Voice says that I'm not to say or do anything otherwise party dies and that they're in the same situation...I panicked and soap slips out of my paws and lands on the grass in front of me.. and myself, monk and sorcerer are tied to a tree, am the only not wearing clothesDM calls a 10min break so we call all stop laughing.Tl;dr..

Cain was a full blooded Orc. At level 1 he had 20 strength. And Cain used two handed weapons. Meaning he would hit almost anyone on anything but a critical fail and would hit like a truck. So with this in mind what did Cain the Orc Barbarian do?Our first encounter was on a miniboss bandit to get exposition, they were behind a weak wooden barrier. On the first round I somehow managed to get the initiative with my trash dexterity. So I charge through the wall and hit the boss with a critical. The Boss died before he could give any exposition.So we stumble our way into the first dungeon, a mine where magic gems were being stolen, and were working our way through and against some peons and then I roll a 1. We use a randomized crit fail wheel to determine what happens. I rolled \"Hit your nearest Ally with a Critical Threat\" the party leader was right next to my. The GM let the Player survive simply because it would be kinda stupid but basically said he'd let each person get one instance of plot armor.We reach the boss, kick the shit out of it, get the a ton of gold. Then the party decides to cooperate with me to break Cain even further, and mind you as a barbarian he can jack up his strength to 24 through his innate Rage Ability. We pool our gold together to buy Cain a +4 Strength Belt.Cain reaches level 2 and to sum up the party it consists of the Party Leader a Magus, a frog man gunner, Cain's brother who is an Elf who just hung around Orcs for a while, and two magical anime girls one edgy the other cheery. Cain also has armor that literally brings him back from the dead once per day, so literal plot armor.The Frog has begun to just hang out on Cain's shoulder due to the size difference. Nothing particular interesting happens besides Cain just being too strong for his own good until the party heads into basically a hellish part of the world, where only monsters roam and magic doesn't work in parts of it. Guess what? Rage isn't magic bitches.We enter the dungeon to go rescue some schmuck and there's a boss gauntlet and then the real dungeon with a super monster running around that we have to avoid. Naturally we go through the boss gauntlet and at the end there's a big fuck off guy wielding a Cannon. Cain also got a cool sword but who cares this guy has a cannon.So Cain kicks his ass takes his Cannon and just wields it when he's giant or he could just use it to Coup De Gras people with it's x4 Critical Damage multiplier on an absurd amount damage already and we have someone who can sleep people (edgy magic girl). So we go through the dungeon and we find a big fuck off humanoid cat monster guy with claws who has Mister McGuffin locked up.Cain is about level 5 by this point. And we'd been in this dungeon for about a month. So I got the mage to enlarge Cain. So now Cain is also a big fuckoff guy with even more strength. About 30. 30 is literally the highest defined strength in the scale. A Fire Giant has 30 Strength. So Cain charges at the boss calling him out like a wrestler \"Let me tell you something I'm gonna mount your head on my wall even though I don't own any buildings.\".The Boss manages to kill the leader because Cain didn't decide to do 2 extra damage that would've killed him because he's an idiot. But this Rustles Cain and triggers a feat that gives him more strength. 2 more to be exact so he has surpassed the scale. Cain kills the guy but Mister McGuffin is comatose because he has no soul. We get the party leader revived.We eventually make our way to the main city to get another McGuffin but this time its a box. And a Sea Serpent is attacking the Bridge. Cain rolls a 1 and commits Seppeku after he already gotten healed once from his armor. He gets revived. Unfortunately there's a big tournament going on to get said box. So Cain goes to the shop with his fuck off amount of gold and gets some new items including upgrading his +4 belt to a +6, and getting a ring with a little surprise. The party leader is up first and gets close to beating the boss who heals.Cain's surprise is a ring of enlarge person with a command phrase. And that command phrase is \"Let me tell you something..\" so Cain tells him that the only thing being ripped apart is him and then the other guy also enlarges into basically a monster because apparently he was some famous mercenary who was multiple levels higher than Cain but Cain rolled good so he kicked his ass. We were supposed to cheat but Cain just needs to hit really hard.TL;DR: Let me tell you something, nobody goes unless the 34 strength Level 5 Orc says they can go, so no go yo.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 631, "stickied": false, "score": 57, "submission_time": "Fri Oct  6 19:28:11 2017", "ups": 57}, {"body": "So many good stories, so many.

Our relationship was one of those ones that everyone (even we) saw coming from miles and years away, then things just fell into place and we got together.  We were blissful, but she became pregnant about 5 months into the relationship.  There was then the emotional toll parenting takes but we were somehow making it work.  Then she tasted some of her old life one night and realized that it was more important than a healthy relationship.  Long story short:  I was doing 12 hr factory shifts, as soon as I get home, she would \"go to work\" at a chain restaurant, after that she would go to the bar with co-workers until the place shut down (from on average 10pm - 2am) come home plastered.  When this started, kiddo was 17 months old and it lasted for 6 months despite my protests.  Because it started as one night a week (ok, cool.  Let out your steam), then 2 nights (o..k...) then it became 5 nights a week (uh...no).  On top of that, I found out she was leaving work early or calling out.  And then I found some text messages on her phone from a guy friend at work and I went off the handle.  She was asking him to meet her at a shut down gas station at 2am.  Lost my shit, addressed it, worked it out, shit kept fucking happening and I kept starting fights, then she broke up with me because (she's saying this as my 22 month old child sits in her lap) I was challenging her freedom.  ...Bitch where's my freedom?!  I got nothing.  I work, I come home, see you for 5 god damn seconds, play with the kid, go to sleep, wake up to you all over me in a drunken state and came to realize you were still horny even though you'd just gotten some well before you got home.  I didn't want to do anything because I was working 50 - 60 hours a week.  You were hanging out at the house with Mickey Mouse on TV so you could poke around on the computer and rewatch Netflix, then work all of 15 hours a week, if that.  And honestly...it took me several months to realize that...How poorly I was being treated.  How manipulated I was.  How little investment she emotionally had for me.  She was the only person who I have loved romantically, and she could not have any cared less for me or what I felt and thought.  Because I was a threat to her freedom.  And it was finally saying to myself that I was just there to help amplify how cool she looks, helped me move on.  I had a band going up until 4 months before we broke up.  I broke up the band because I was an anxiety written wreck and half my band was only with it so they could say \"I'M IN A BAND.\"  She said from the get-go, she saw potential with us.  I firmly wish the guys I have now, we're with us back then.  We might have stood a chance, instead of how badly we ended up burying ourselves.I constantly get down-voted whenever I bring up words like \"control freak\" and \"narcissist.\"  I am fully aware of the definition of those terms and I only use such terms in their proper application.  When the basis of your relationship is because the other person thinks you'll make them look better, that's narcissism.  When they manipulate your life to the point where you no longer have one because their life and how it's viewed by people she hasn't seen since she left that job, is FAR more important, then that's a control freak.And...I always found it funny how 2 months after we broke up, the guy she was cheating on me with moved a couple hours away to work things out with the respective mom of his kids.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 18036, "stickied": false, "score": 11, "submission_time": "Fri Oct  6 15:30:25 2017", "ups": 11}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/74liso/how_did_you_get_over_that_one_person_you_never/", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "~~like~~ luke warm california roll from a gas station slathered in soy sauce", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 117322, "stickied": false, "score": 658, "submission_time": "Fri Oct  6 17:38:03 2017", "ups": 658}, {"body": "Mixing very, very expensive alcohol with something cheap.

To determine if they do contain life and to study that life in detail. Places such as Mars, Enceladus, Europa, etc. And it might be, as with Mars especially, that life did exist there but doesn't currently.We really can't reliably detect life that it as low concentrations, low levels of activity, and in sub-surface environments across interstellar distances. And we definitely can't reliably detect whether or not a planet once housed microbial life that went extinct millions of years ago.What we are looking for more specifically is robust and highly active life that forms an entire biosphere and is has as much of a role in the development of that world as does geological processes. Not just worlds with life but living worlds. If you look at Earth, for example, you see that life affects everything. It affects the atmosphere (which wouldn't contain Oxygen without life), it affects the climate, it affects the weather, it affects the soil, erosion, etc, etc, etc. Earth is a living world. That's the sort of world that we could potentially detect as such from across interstellar distances. We could see the Oxygen, we could see the methane out of equilibrium, we could see the chlorophyll even.Robust life of that magnitude requires more than sub-surface oceans and chemosynthesis, it requires much more favorable environments for life that include vastly larger energy inputs. And that means planets with lots of liquid water and substantial atmospheres. Tons of solar power falling on environments that can support enormous quantities of biomass production. Gas giant and ice giant planets just don't fit the bill because they lack the surfaces with sunlight falling on them to classify as suitable environments. It's not impossible that life could evolve in the atmospheres of gas giants but it is very difficult to see how that would work. And smaller planets are also not good candidates because they generally will not be able to hold onto their atmospheres for billions of years if they are also close enough to their stars to have liquid water oceans. So that leaves a narrow band of possible habitats that are pretty close to Earth.Additionally, a major aspect to this research is the search not just for other life in general but intelligent life. And from everything we know it seems like the only way to get intelligent, technological life is to start from living worlds, worlds teeming with life. And that again narrows things down to very Earth-like planets.Also, there's nothing stopping us from looking for signs of life in other planets we detect, but without going out of our way to detect Earth-like planets they would not necessarily have been found very quickly, because they are a bit harder to detect than some other types (like hot Jupiters).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 111569, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 02:05:05 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "We are almost certain that life requires liquid water, so looking at a planet like is too far or too close to the sun means you won't find life.

To determine if they do contain life and to study that life in detail. Places such as Mars, Enceladus, Europa, etc. And it might be, as with Mars especially, that life did exist there but doesn't currently.We really can't reliably detect life that it as low concentrations, low levels of activity, and in sub-surface environments across interstellar distances. And we definitely can't reliably detect whether or not a planet once housed microbial life that went extinct millions of years ago.What we are looking for more specifically is robust and highly active life that forms an entire biosphere and is has as much of a role in the development of that world as does geological processes. Not just worlds with life but living worlds. If you look at Earth, for example, you see that life affects everything. It affects the atmosphere (which wouldn't contain Oxygen without life), it affects the climate, it affects the weather, it affects the soil, erosion, etc, etc, etc. Earth is a living world. That's the sort of world that we could potentially detect as such from across interstellar distances. We could see the Oxygen, we could see the methane out of equilibrium, we could see the chlorophyll even.Robust life of that magnitude requires more than sub-surface oceans and chemosynthesis, it requires much more favorable environments for life that include vastly larger energy inputs. And that means planets with lots of liquid water and substantial atmospheres. Tons of solar power falling on environments that can support enormous quantities of biomass production. Gas giant and ice giant planets just don't fit the bill because they lack the surfaces with sunlight falling on them to classify as suitable environments. It's not impossible that life could evolve in the atmospheres of gas giants but it is very difficult to see how that would work. And smaller planets are also not good candidates because they generally will not be able to hold onto their atmospheres for billions of years if they are also close enough to their stars to have liquid water oceans. So that leaves a narrow band of possible habitats that are pretty close to Earth.Additionally, a major aspect to this research is the search not just for other life in general but intelligent life. And from everything we know it seems like the only way to get intelligent, technological life is to start from living worlds, worlds teeming with life. And that again narrows things down to very Earth-like planets.Also, there's nothing stopping us from looking for signs of life in other planets we detect, but without going out of our way to detect Earth-like planets they would not necessarily have been found very quickly, because they are a bit harder to detect than some other types (like hot Jupiters).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 111569, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 02:05:05 2017", "ups": 2}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/74ngz6/in_the_search_of_exoplanets_why_exactly_are_we/", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "The main theorems and proofs we see today are not what would have been seen when the ideas were first coming around.

A father who chooses not to abandon his family because his parents were married etc. The government can't fix this (although they can tweak public policy to encourage marriage etc), the people in the trenches reducing the epidemic are and will be largely unnoticed because it is truly a ripple through time problem. The government can only respond after the fact when trying to turn addicts to productive citizens.Public policy is part of the solution but is not and should not be the answer.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 10, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 02:15:06 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Actually US customs have cracked down heavily on drugs being imported from china and other nations, but nobody here will see this, all you wanna do is circle jerk in an echo chamber.

[\u2026] Further, CAP Action Fund openly runs political advocacy campaigns, and plays a central role in the Democratic Party\u2019s infrastructure, and the new reporting staff down the hall isn\u2019t exactly walled off from that message machine, nor does it necessarily keep its distance from liberal groups organizing advocacy campaigns targeting conservatives.CAP receives money from multibillionaire hedge fund manager George Soros through two of his nonprofit groups, the Foundation to Support Open Society and the Open Society Institute. From 2005 through 2010, the two organizations gave CAP over $5.4 million. CAP receives money from other liberal-leaning foundations,Some of the organizations\u2019 donations have been highly questionable. For example, Bermuda-based Atlantic Philanthropies donated $1.5 million to the CAP Action Fund, which operates ThinkProgress in 2010. (Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory.) United States-based foundations are forbidden by tax law from donating to organizations incorporated under Section 501(c)(4)\u2014such as CAP Action\u2014but as POLITICO reports, no such restrictions apply to foreign grant-makers. http://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2011/05/funding-the-left-from-bermuda-035903Labor unions are also major sources of funding for the Center and especially ThinkProgress. According to unions\u2019 required filings to the Department of Labor, since 2009 unions have donated over $2.2 million to the two organizations. Unsurprisingly, The Center and ThinkProgress have provided fawning coverage of unions and endorsed policies the unions support, like the \u201ccard check\u201d legislation and the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d). Additionally, the former Secretary-Treasurer of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Anna Burger, was named to the CAP Action board of directors in 2010.

Male promiscuity requires either female promiscuity, male homosexuality, or a very lopsided female to male ratio. In fact, the only place in the world where there is rampant male promiscuity without rampant female promiscuity or male homosexuality is Eastern Europe, where the gender ratio is like 100:90 or something.

One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.Revolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.Importantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone\u2019s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone\u2019s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.Argumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.As feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women\u2019s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women\u2019s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women\u2019s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.By the late \u201870s women\u2019s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women\u2019s studies were fired because they had master\u2019s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women\u2019s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women\u2019s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.Whereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women\u2019s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women\u2019s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.Suddenly more and more women began to either call themselves \u201cfeminists\u201d or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.Without the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a \u201cvictim\u201d of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Without the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a \u201cvictim\u201d of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a \u201cfeminist.\u201d Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.By the early \u201880s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.Feminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men\u2019s movement. Often men\u2019s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "74m085", "gilded": 0, "stickied": true, "title": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: \"Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000)", "num_comments": 1, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 5, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 697, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/74m085/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_3_consciousnessraising/", "submission_time": "Fri Oct  6 10:58:30 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "**[Part 1 - Come closer to feminism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/73yq84/hooked_on_bell_hooks_come_closer_to_feminism_from/)****[Part 2 - Feminist politics - where we stand](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74ekcz/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_2_feminist_politics/)**", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 23, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Fri Oct  6 10:59:40 2017", "ups": 1}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74m085/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_3_consciousnessraising/", "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "Being a doula-or birth companion-is another great opportunity for many who do not necessarily have the means to go to school.

If you disagree, feel free to comment, this post's purpose is for a discussion for different view points.Though in no particular order, the first most common argument I hear is, 'I'm not a feminist because I'm not...' and they would make reference to the feminists they don't like, be it the red haired lady, the 'triggered' lady so on and so forth. I find this problematic because, why dissociate oneself from a movement you care about just because there are people you don't like who are in the movement or what have you. I say three to four points because this point often gets tied into 'what is feminism' and while I have my view on what feminism is, too many ignore the multiple viewpoints of what feminism is and only put what they believe as feminism, 'ie man hating', as the truth of feminism. The second is the notion that 'we don't need feminism in the west'. Granted, this is based on my experience, but those who claim feminism isn't needed in the west often say they don't see the need because 'misogyny doesn't exist'. 'I am all for women working,' or 'I love a strong women' so on and so forth. What they fail to realize, is that though it may be true for them, and perhaps for their demographic, such as where they live etc. etc. doesn't mean that misogyny doesn't exist. Thirdly, a common argument people make is 'why not simply egalitarian'. This I don't have a problem with in it and of itself, but sometimes when I talk about feminist issues, it turns into a 'who is more oppressed discussion'. It also devolves into a 'male privilege' issue. People get defensive about male privilege, claiming 'well I grew up poor' etc. as if male privilege is a bad thing. Lastly, those who claim they are not a feminist because of biology. \"Women should not go into military because of biology. women are weaker, or even, men cannot function properly when a women is around\". Not only do I disagree with this factual statement, but the key issue I want to talk about is, 'are we really slaves to are biology'? For example, even if it's true that 'men cannot function properly around women', I am sure we can train ourselves to go beyond. Look at monks who meditate days without food. (Though I don't think it's healthy, that's besides the point.) The point is, we most definitely can ignore our biology, in my opinion. On a side note, there are people who say 'no one says this and that' which is again problematic or 'well that's not the majority. the majority doesn't think xyz religious fanatic thoughts'. Majority or not, they do exist, and I think by ignoring it or saying 'we anti feminists aren't like this' is the same thing as my first point.Thank you for the read. For those who agree with me, what are your experiences like? For those who disagree, again, let me know your thoughts.

Not that 19/20/21 is young in absolute terms...) so I just wanted to give you a big pat on the back/high five/hug for doing that. I'm sure it means a lot to him.

I'm sure his adoptive family have framed your relationship with him really beautifully, and in many of the foster/adoptive placements the kids have a lot more curiosity about the situation than they have confusion or transferred maternal attachment.

I feel like I'm rambling but my main initial point was supposed to be... a biological connection with family is so beneficial (when it's healthy/safe). If he's asking to meet but you're not ready to do so, could your mum or dad/his bio grandparents be an option for \"contact.\" That could be really fun for him and take the heat off you for a bit? I have no idea if this would be appropriate in your situation but as a foster carer a lot of the time the kids' main biological connection is retained through their grandparents while in care and these are some of the warmest, most loving relationships I've seen.

You will probably feel shit but there's a good chance the good feelings from the encounter will outweigh the bad, and feeling shit comes with living. Only you know if the emotions surrounding this are manageable because they just come with the territory, or if they would be self destructive. If they would be self destructive, don't visit him. If you'd just feel shitty and apprehensive and guilty and all around wonky - welcome to parenthood.

My parents have been divorced since I was 11, and my mom got remarried when I was almost 14 years old. When my mom and my stepdad first started dating when I was around 12, he was great and I really liked him. We didn't live with him at that time because we were living in a different country. When I turned 13, my mom and I started living with him when we moved to him to his home country. Around that time he started changing and being kind of mean, He would yell at me for the stupidest things and he would get angry really fast, but luckily my mom was always there to defend me. At some point he started going to a psychologist and she told him that he was acting that way because he was jealous of my relationship with my mom (we were always very close). Anyway, fast forward a couple of years and he started changing for the better again. He started being very supportive and helpful (and I didn't mention before that he helped my mom and I a lot, in many different aspects). I am now 24 and I just finished my MA thesis (which he helped me with a lot). In short, even though we had our differences in the past, he is a great guy who has always done everything in his power to help me and my mother out.The story gets a bit weird now. For the past few years, whenever me and him were alone, he would strip down butt naked and tan outside the house (no one can see this), and he would come up with weird excuses to call me so I can see him. I don't know if this was intentional, but for example, he would tell me to help him lift a table to take it to another room and the towel that would be wrapped around him would fall on the floor, exposing everything. He has done this quite a few times.Something else that he does that is a bit more upsetting for me is when he asks me to give him a full body massage while he is butt naked. He has done this everytime the two of us are alone, and I doubt he has ever asked my mom. The reason I finally decided to post today is because he actually asked me today to even massage the area around his testicles, which I refused of course. I was so taken aback that I didn't know what to do, so I finally decided to post here for advice. I haven't ever told my mom because I don't want to sabotage their relationship and because I don't want to seem ungrateful after everything he did and still does for us. The reason we were alone at home the other day was because he came all the way from another country to help me with some paperwork, so now you can understand why I am feeling conflicted in all of this. So, to sum things up... Should I tell my mom? Should I just shut up and ignore everything? In his defense, he has a sciatica and he has back problems, so asking for a massage was pretty much understandable, but I just can't fathom why he would strip down butt naked each time, even goingas far as to ask me to massage his testicle area and his entire body. P.S. He also asked me a couple of times to wax his private areas at some point. One time he also took me to this secluded beach and stripped down, asking me to take pictures of him coming out naked from the water.

In November, I got pregnant at 21 years old with a man who I was very much in love with. I imagined spending my life with this person, he was my first love my everything. My period was a day late, and I had been feeling super strange and so even without taking the test I was pregnant. I took the test just to confirm, twice and I was about 4 weeks along from my calculations. My whole world was upside down, I\u2019d always wanted this, to be a mother. I felt so protective and strange about this little life inside of me but what was I going to do? One year into college, on a student visa in a country that is not my own, with a very unstable life.So then I told my SO,  he reacted as I expected he would, he cried and told me he was scared and he seemed quite upset. The day that I told him, he had to go work for his mom and I was alone which is fine because I didn\u2019t want to ask him to not go to work because of me. Later in the night I called him and discovered he didn\u2019t have to go to work last minute and instead he was at his friends house playing video games and getting high (he used to smoke weed a lot) So that night I felt the most despair and isolation I\u2019ve ever felt. And obviously disappointment. Over the next two weeks we discussed and weighed our options and he came to the conclusion that he didn\u2019t want to keep it, he said things like he wanted to be married to me and he didn\u2019t want people to think we got married cause I was pregnant, and he wanted time with just me.. etc.. Honestly I knew it was because he didn\u2019t want to give up his lifestyle with his friends and his car and his weed. So I scheduled the abortion, and went through with it in the most zombie like mind set I\u2019ve ever been in. I was between a rock and a hard place, would I make the man I love resent me and this baby? Or would I give up this baby to make him happy and for us to have a future and have babies later?The months following were the darkest of my life, and I was so depressed and dependent on him. The more I needed him the more he withdrew, all our plans of a house and a future were slowly fading away. I should also mention that throughout our relationship his ex never stopped messaging him, and appearing in our lives, I was so paranoid but he always said he loved me and wanted to be with me.So now I\u2019m here, my baby would be three months old and last night I had a dream about it. He was beautiful and chubby and bright.

I recommend it because now I struggle and I\u2019m in pain, and I\u2019m fighting very hard to understand why this had to happen to me. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m not a victim, I\u2019m stronger and more independent and I have a very productive and good life right now but I just wish that I had been an advocate for myself and my values. Please if you\u2019re struggling, message me or talk to someone you trust. Because sometimes the person you\u2019re in a relationship with, isn\u2019t the best thing for you and you won\u2019t realize it if you keep telling yourself youre paranoid and crazy.

The growing cysts damaged my left Fallopian tube beyond repair. Surgeon discovered my right ovary and Fallopian tube were surgically removed. I had an appendectomy when I was a child and the surgeon scooped out more than just my appendix. Now I'm infertile and wondering what to do.I just had laparoscopic surgery to remove two dermoid cysts (solid cysts that can be filled with hair, teeth, or bone) on my ovary. My surgeon saw that I do not have a right ovary or Fallopian tube, but I did have scar tissue and some adhesions on my uterus where it should have been connected. After the surgery, my doctor told my parents and husband that all indicators pointed to my ovary and Fallopian tube being surgically removed some time ago. I knew it all along. Those assholes took too much out.When my first ultrasound results came back, the radiologist noted the right ovary was not visible. Google tried to reassure me. Apparently, ovaries are sneaky bastards that like to hide behind intestines. Sure. Fine. No worries. Then my doctor ordered an MRI. The results came back again. \"Right ovary not visualized; unavailable for comment.\" Umm. Google had nothing to say about ovaries playing hide and seek on an MRI. The PA I saw gave me the same line she gave me for the ultrasound, it's just probably behind my bowels. I knew better.I had an appendectomy 17 years ago. I was 7. My parents swear up and down that they were never informed that the surgeon had removed anything other than my inflamed appendix. I was left with one ovary and one Fallopian tube and no one knew.Yes, I have survived thus far without a chunk of my reproductive organs. My left ovary has been dubbed \"The Little Ovary That Could\" for picking up all the slack. I went through puberty at a normal age, and my periods have always been regular. Painful, but damned predictable and consistent. I would have never known about my missing parts if not for the dermoids.Following my cystectomy, the surgeon notified my family that my only remaining Fallopian tube had been scarred shut. The two dermoid cysts had pinched and squeezed it for who knows how long, causing the damage. My husband and parents were told I can't have children without IVF.I'm in the process of getting my medical records to see if I have any legal ground, but I'm not sure if there is anything to pursue.

Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on August 25--prior to the September reference periods--resulting in severe damage in Texas and other areas of the Gulf Coast.    > Our analysis suggests that the net effect of these hurricanes was to reduce the estimate of total nonfarm payroll employment for September. There was no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate. No changes were made to either the establishment or household survey estimation procedures for the September figures. For both surveys, collection rates generally were within normal ranges, both nationally and in the affected states. In the establishment survey, employees who are not paid for the pay period that includes the 12th of the month are not counted as employed. In the household survey, persons with a job are counted as employed even if they miss work for the entire survey reference week (the week including the 12th of the month), regardless of whether or not they are paid. For both surveys, national estimates do not include Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands.
