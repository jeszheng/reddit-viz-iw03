Both parties are actively trying to censor their wrongdoings from the media. If one party succeeds, they both benefit. * 2) There is video/audio of Trump saying things, but never acting on them. The evidence is real in Harvey Weinstein's case, with tapes and witnesses coming forward as evidence.* 3) Trump apologized for what he said, and admitted that it was wrong and that he should not have done it. You would be surprised by how many people dismiss his actions by the apology alone. Look up 'confirmation bias'. Whether his apology is sincere or not is another question.* 4) There is no active legal litigation open against Trump. Most of the accusations have been closed or settled and sealed outside of court. There are many cases open against Weinstein.* 5) In this type of crime, many women just want to get on with their lives and prevent information from going public. Settling outside of court and sealing records is a very attractive settlement. It can work for anyone who has enough money. Trump has billions, Weinstein has hundreds of millions. Who is going to last longer? You can even apply this theory to the catholic church.* 6) I saw this on reddit and wish I could cite the user. But the nature of sexual assault is *very* difficult to prove. It's not like murder, where a dead body with a gunshot is enough to prove a crime happened. Evidence of sexual assault usually provides the same evidence of consensual sex. This is of course assuming that the many studies supported by feminist organizations are true in that women choose not to fight their attacker far more often than choosing to fight. I do not defend Trump in any way. He is probably guilty and I would never allow my own daughter to be around him. But, being a man who has been falsely accused in the past, I keep note on the differences in my case and other people's cases. Sadly, I've found some sadistic facts. There will never be an absolute solution to ending sexual assault nor a guaranteed way of putting your abuser behind bars. Could we believe that women are always telling the truth? Sure, we'll get another Jodi Arias, Shirley Turner or Crystal Mangum. Women are predators too, and men have the right to defend themselves, as do women.

Admitting their candidates faults means admitting defeat. Notice how people cry fake news the moment anything negative comes out about their candidate.

In the USA, the left and right have always had disagreements on the role of government in society or the best policy prescriptions to solve problems.  Up until the last decade, the two sides could debate ideas and policy in a civil way.  However, things have changed in a very negative way.  The extreme leftists have hijacked politics.  If you pay attention their strategy is to no longer debate ideas or policies.  They seek to shut up anyone who disagrees with them by solely making character attacks.  The basis of all their arguements boil down to this:  \u201cI have to offer no evidence, no statistics, no logical arguments, or propose any solutions.  What I say is \u2018my truth\u2019 and if you disagree with anything I say, it is a direct attack on my identity and those of my larger identity group.  Therefore you are a racist / sexist / bigot / xenophobe / homophobe / neo-nazi who is so vile that you should not not even be allowed to speak or question me.\u201dWhen you really examine these people, they are quickly moving towards that old leftist tactic of fascism.  That\u2019s right, fascism is not a right wing ideology... it never was.  Fascism arose from the left when Mussolini, while leading the communist party of Italy, realized that Marx was wrong when he predicted the proletariat would rise up.  He realized that people won\u2019t die for their class, but they will die for their country.  His new movement focused on leveraging nationalism to build a strong, centralized socialist government.  This government won\u2019t seize the means of production like communism, rather they will dominate the private economy through a de facto regulatory structure. To enact this plan, it was essential that everybody be on board, which means all dissent must be stifled.  He organized his Black Shirts to harass, attack, and silence anyone who dissented for the State sanctioned ideology or politics.  Similarly, Hitler is a product of left wing ideology.  He took over the German Workers Party, the communist party of Germany, and morphed them into the Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party, or Nazis for short.  In his own words, Hitler emphasized that the Socialism\u2019s was their main ideology and that nationalism was nearly a tool to attain socialism in Germany.  Similarly, Hitler uses his Brown shirts to harass and attack any that disagreed with him.  To disagree with either of these two leftist dictators was to attack The People.  Any politically incorrect speech was deemed to be violence, and therefore they were justified in responding with actual violence.  Strange, all of seems familiar when you look at Antifa and their tactics.Most people don\u2019t recognize these parallels outright, but they can sense that something is off.  They sense that the status quo has changed.  They see the rise of extremism and the attempts to silence dissent and it puts them off.  They see that mainstream ideology is now being attacked with vitriol and physical violence.  Now, with all that said, most SJWs aren\u2019t bad people.  They don\u2019t realize that they are being used as pawns for far left wing purposes.  I think that the majority of them have good intentions, but they have been taught that fascism is good so long as it is used for the right reasons.  Most Americans just want to be left alone to go about their business, but a fundamental tenant of fascism is that nobody should be left to their own devices and that they need a strong government to guide all aspects of their life.

So, someone suggested using taxes to pay for them. Some people immediately claimed it was too socialist, too progressive, and that the previous method of paying firemen to save a house was perfect. Why should other people pay to save your house or pay to participate in a program which only triggers in the event of an emergency? It took a while to campaign for this change and more to enact it. We're thankful for the tax inclusion of fire services now, because we're conditioned to their presence as a social need in society.If you don't like SJWs, think about your reaction to them and the title.

However, since the plane he was in was also accelerating towards the earth, it looked and felt just like it would if there had been no gravity.Imagine you're looking down a very long elevator shaft, and you dropped a penny down it. The penny would start out stationary and because of gravity it would accelerate constantly downwards, gathering more and more speed. Now imagine instead of a penny, you dropped an elevator car downwards. It would start out stationary like the penny, then drop in the same fashion. If there's no air in the shaft, it'll have exactly the same velocity at any point in time as the penny would have.Now imagine you drop both at the same time, the penny in the centre of the elevator car. Both accelerate downwards: the penny matches the speed of the elevator precisely, and so remains in the centre of the car throughout. From inside the car, it looks and feels like the penny is not subject to gravity... but in reality it's just exactly as subject-to-gravity as the car is.To reproduce this effect in a plane, we can fly it to a safe altitude, aim it somewhat upwards, and then follow the path and speed it would take if it all the air suddenly disappeared. Its motion would become purely ballistic, just like the motion of everyone in the plane. It would follow a parabola and eventually drop back down to earth. The motion of the people inside would follow a parabola and eventually drop back down to earth.From the point of view of the people inside, they're floating in the plane!Of course, we can only do this for a while, before we need to level the plane out again.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 40460, "stickied": false, "score": 24, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 15 21:05:58 2017", "ups": 24}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/76je20/what_allows_humans_to_control_gravity_in_an/", "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "Well, why is liquid the second state of matter when it it just solid with more kinetic energy?

Note, first, that sec^(2)(arctan(x))=1+x^(2). You can just use the fact that tan^(2)(x)+1=sec^(2)(x) and plug in arctan. Next, the derivative of tan(x) is sec^(2)(x), which follows from the quotient rule and the derivative for sine and cosine. So we next want to implicitly differentiate the equation tan(arctan(x))=x with respect to x. Using the Chain Rule, you get that* tan'(arctan(x))\\*arctan'(x) = 1But we know the derivative of tan(x) is sec^(2)(x), and plugging in arctan(x) into it gives* (1+x^(2))arctan'(x) = 1Solving for arctan'(x) then gives 1/(1+x^(2)). So the fact that the derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1+x^(2)) is really a statement of the Pythagorean Theorem.Also, this function you chose is closely related to the [Cauchy Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution) and is often thought of as a [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) that has \"fat tails\" (because it goes to zero much slower).-------------------------------------------------------------------As a tiny correction for terminology: A function doesn't have a single antiderivative, if has infinitely many antiderivatives. arctan(x) is *an* antiderivative of 1/(1+x^(2)). The general form for an antiderivative is then arctan(x)+C, where C is any real value. Fixing a value for C then provides you with one out of infinitely many antiderivatives. We often say that the \"indefinite integral\" is the collection of *all* antiderivatives of a function, and write it in the form arctan(x)+C. So the indefinite integral of 1/(1+x^(2)) is arctan(x)+C, but arctan(x) is *an* antiderivative of 1/(1+x^(2)).

Here, we will have to go a bit further than standard Calc 1 knowledge (American I assume; European tends to include that) For that it is easiest to work with complex numbers and the logarithm.In a few steps:- Consider an axis-parallel triangle where one corner is the origin and the other is (1,b).

To preface, I like to think about math a lot. This was one the times where I was thinking in the shower about math. I questioned how to make the general shape of a bell curve, and I came up with f(x) = (x^2 + 1)^(-1), which produces a nice lump around the y axis, without causing any vertical asymptotes. Later, I was exploring the properties of this function, and I discovered its antiderivative is very simple: arctan(x) + C. Because it was so clean looking, but also somehow related to trigonmetry, I was wondering the reason behind this. However, I struggled to find resources on this that shed light into the reasoning behind this. Why does an inverse trigonometric function have a completely non-trigonometric derivative?For reference, I'm currently taking Calculus I; we haven't gotten to antiderivatives yet, but I am comfortable with the concept, as well as doing some calculations.

Here, we will have to go a bit further than standard Calc 1 knowledge (American I assume; European tends to include that) For that it is easiest to work with complex numbers and the logarithm.In a few steps:- Consider an axis-parallel triangle where one corner is the origin and the other is (1,b). If the opening angle of this triangle is \\theta, then b=\\tan(\\theta) and thus \\theta=\\arctan(b).- The complex logarithm of a number  a+ib gives the log of the length  plus i=\\sqrt{-1} times the the opening angle.- Combining both we get that \\arctan(x)=1/(2i)*(log(x+i)-log(x-i))Here, the lengths cancel and you just get the angles.- Finally, how does that fit with the integral?If i=\\sqrt{-1}, then 1/(1+x^2)=1/(2i) * (1/(x-i)-1/(x+i)).The integral of 1/x is a log, so you get that  \\arctan(x)=1/(2i) *(\\log(x-i)-\\log(x+i))and thus your explanation.As a side remark: Some books on complex numbers and hypergeometric functions basically work this way around. That is, you first introduce \\arcsin and \\arccos as integrals and then define \\sin and \\cos as their inverse functions.

Note, first, that sec^(2)(arctan(x))=1+x^(2). You can just use the fact that tan^(2)(x)+1=sec^(2)(x) and plug in arctan. Next, the derivative of tan(x) is sec^(2)(x), which follows from the quotient rule and the derivative for sine and cosine. So we next want to implicitly differentiate the equation tan(arctan(x))=x with respect to x. Using the Chain Rule, you get that* tan'(arctan(x))\\*arctan'(x) = 1But we know the derivative of tan(x) is sec^(2)(x), and plugging in arctan(x) into it gives* (1+x^(2))arctan'(x) = 1Solving for arctan'(x) then gives 1/(1+x^(2)). So the fact that the derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1+x^(2)) is really a statement of the Pythagorean Theorem.Also, this function you chose is closely related to the [Cauchy Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution) and is often thought of as a [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) that has \"fat tails\" (because it goes to zero much slower).-------------------------------------------------------------------As a tiny correction for terminology: A function doesn't have a single antiderivative, if has infinitely many antiderivatives. arctan(x) is *an* antiderivative of 1/(1+x^(2)). The general form for an antiderivative is then arctan(x)+C, where C is any real value. Fixing a value for C then provides you with one out of infinitely many antiderivatives. We often say that the \"indefinite integral\" is the collection of *all* antiderivatives of a function, and write it in the form arctan(x)+C. So the indefinite integral of 1/(1+x^(2)) is arctan(x)+C, but arctan(x) is *an* antiderivative of 1/(1+x^(2)). (Though, indefinite integrals have almost nothing to do with actual integrals and are just a convenient mechanism to reverse derivative rules to find antiderivatives, but that's a whole other story.)", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 95909, "stickied": false, "score": 12, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 15 22:38:19 2017", "ups": 12}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/76k76y/why_is_arctanx_c_the_antiderivative_of_x2_11/", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "It is called magnetic shielding.If you do not wish to include and ensure that the earth's magnetic field does not interact with your experiment, you simply orientate it towards the direction of the earth's magnetic field, this way, you shield your said experiement to prevent any systematic errors arising from a background source.To shield your set-up from other magnetic fields, it is often done by using large sheets of magnetic material(Iron, steel, Nickel etc.) and covering your entire set up with it.

Most plants are so ridiculously automated it's not even funny. Even the older ones.As someone stated though the lack of load would cause the generators to trip and with that happening the reactor would trip because there's nothing to take the load. Nuke plants aren't great at varying loads so a sudden drop off in load usage would cause it all to shutdown for safety reasons automatically. When we had that big power outtage many years ago on the east coast the plants all went into shut down because the systems all tripped as there was a sudden lack of load as far as the generators were concerned and all the reactors went into safety \"OH shit our powers got nowhere to go\" mode and started shut down processes. Which sometimes causes problems as the back ups for some plants are primarily fed from the grid (backups used if not acailable) but because the whole grid went down some back ups didn't do what they should have.Source: Am Nuclear Operator Edit:Few questions were asked.1) Depending on the age of the plant, in a perfect world they should technically run without any human intervention for quite awhile. That said no plant runs perfectly so it could be as short as a day before lack of humans causes it to shut down or a few weeks. As someone said they have entire shifts of people for the reactors I'm at at all times and they're integral to making sure it runs smoothly but even without us it generally can run for awhile before issues arise and it shuts down, but it's also a much older so without us it'd fall apart.2) The simulated load is incredibly low as the plants can't really run if there's nothing to draw the load. It's hard to just have electricity go to nothing and it's hard to pretend there's a load that can use up the pure energy a nuclear reactor puts out. Nuclear reactors do not handle adjusting their power very well and at relatively high numbers begin to poison themselves out if the level is too low. Something like 60%, I think I can't remember, reactor power causes it to be overwhelmed by it's byproducts to the point where it can't keep going and has to basically be shut down restarted after x amount of hours so that it can decay enough to not cripple the reaction. The simulated load would have to be equal to a load above poisoning levels and that's obscenely high. Generally if the generator detects no load drawing from it, it has no choice but to basically be like \"Mr reactor you need to turn off or shit going to go Cray.\"3)Most reactors built nowadays generally have a ton of safety features to hopefully power cool the reactor and poison it out to the point where the reactions stop. However... the fuel is still hot. Really fricken hot. Without the water circulating through it constantly there could be some huge issues. I work at a CANDU reactor. We use heavy water as our heat transfer medium. One of our in case of emergency cool and poison the reactor mediums is a large eater tower that gravity feeds normal light eater into the reactor as that cools and absorbs the reactor faster than the current heavy water in it. However.. It's designed for 1 reactor messing up hard and hoping people can shut the others down (all reactors are independent system wise so that faults on one isn't faults on all 4). Another feature they have assuming 100% lack of power (no back up generators for emergencies) the system is designed to go for as long as it can on a thermal flow option... like, the hot water will flow through the system cool and return back, which they got to test in real life by accident during the black out because the faults were so bad. However it only last so long. The systems probably would never breach containment if it got too hot honestly however the plant itself would be a terrible place to be with how their systems are set up. A meltdown on the levels of what has happened with 3 mile and fukushima are interesting edge cases of poor decision or poor design. Fukushima actually caused my plant to put safeties in place in case something were to happen here... Even though we are nowhere near fault lines. Meltdowns are honestly a hard thing to judge. It depends on how containment is built. It's such a plant by plant basis that it's impossible to say how every plant would react.Edit 2:First off sorry I don't have much for sources. It's mostly the courses we took in training and operating procedure and most of it's not really linkable.Most plants are designed yes to just shut down the reactor if a problem arises and no human interaction occurs. The rods at most meant for poisoning the reactor out and shutting it down are gravity held up by electronic means. If no power, rods drop and kill the reaction really fast.Also the reason the load matters isn't for the reactor itself. It's for the generators. If they aren't using the steam from the reactor to power anything there's almost no reason for the reactor to be running so it would begin to shut itself down. Also my plant will never be re-tubed if that helps. Too old. On her last legs. Which is why we have to be more involved with plant operations, older plant with lots more terrible manual valves and etc.Plants are designed to have as much automation in its processes as technologically available at the time of construction, and as such as time goes on newer plants have more sustainability assuming peak conditions.Side note: If you want to get into it go for it but be warned rotating 12 hour shifts which we have are absolutely the worst.

Generation 3+ plants (none in commercial operation yet), do have up to 1 week of walk away safety, but require operator actions to ensure long term core cooling. The bottom line is you can't leave a nuclear reactor. It takes a year or more before decay heat is low enough to prevent a zirconium fire and core melt or spent fuel pool fire. Operators like myself are licensed at the plant and we cannot leave our watch station until someone else with a license turns over with us. So every day I go in, I cannot leave until someone else who is licensed and qualified for my position takes over. I've done some long shifts due to people calling in sick. As for the plant side: you have to monitor and maintain equipment. Pumps need oil. Tanks need water filled (or drained). Systems need pressure vented. This stuff happens day to day, so without operators, equipment will fail and the plant will trip. Best case scenario, you cool the plant down to cold shutdown and leave it in shutdown cooling mode. If power trips off or anything malfunctions you'll lose core cooling again though, as shutdown cooling typically doesn't have auto restarts. Bottom line: you can't leave a nuclear reactor.

Most plants built in the 60s and 70s are designed to operate with no human interaction for at least 10 minutes. And that would be during what is called a \"design basis accident\", which is some sort of large pipe break in most plants. In a situation where the plant is running fine and all the operators just *poof* disappeared, the plant would keep running normally for a while. If it lost output connection to the electric grid, the plant would automatically shutdown and maintain itself. If it lost electricity coming from the grid, the backup diesel generators would startup and provide power to emergency and safe shutdown systems. Nuclear power plants have enough diesel fuel on site to power emergency systems for at least a week at full load, so in a non emergency situation (ie  nothing breaks) probably longer than that. As for cooling water, it would depend on the plant, but every plant in the US has at least 30 days of cooling water available without makeup in an emergency situation. Of course nuclear safety systems assume that every human doesn't just up and disappear forever, but they will keep themselves cool for quite a while without human interaction. I'd imagine in this scenario  you would start seeing serious issues at nuclear power plants sometime beyond the week mark once plants started running out of diesel fuel. And even then the decay heat would be pretty low and it would take a while after before you started seeing fuel damage. My guess is most plants would eventually end up with some fuel damage without long term cooling, but it likely would be far less than something like fukushima. There would likely be some elevated doses around the plant, but I would imagine they wouldn't be life threatening. Doses would be worse if there were a hydrogen explosion inside containment like fukushima unit 2, and there would definitely be some hydrogen generation once fuel gets exposed, though as long as containment stays intact, there shouldn't be any explosion. I'd hazard a guess that the end result would suck, but pretty much all nuclear material would remain on site and environmental damage would be minimal. As for spent fuel in the spent fuel pools, eventually all the water would boil away without any makeup or cooling, but pretty much all but the most recently discharged fuel would be cool enough to not melt via air cooling. Even in fukushima, the spent fuel pools remained intact, though there was some boil off and a lot of debris in the pools. Some of the hottest spent fuel might experience damage and long term violate spent fuel pool integrity, though radioactive material would remain on-site, and the bulk of the radiation would be directed up from the spent fuel pool. Long term I wouldn't expect any major environmental damage. Everything above of course doesn't look very long term, where the plant eventually collapses and nuclear material leeches into the environment, but we would be talking likely decades before ant plant experienced major structural issues. The real take away is the longer power and therefore cooling to the environment lasts after shutdown, the less bad the end result is. For fukushima they had less than an hour of power after shutdown. In this situation you are looking at likely a week or 2 before power is lost. Even after, core cooling would remain for a while until all that water boiled away. Long term you would still see core damage and elevated doses around the site, but the magnitude would be far less than fukushima. But you are also talking about all 400+ nuclear reactors having the same issue simultaneously, so the end result would be multiplied by that number. Source: former reactor engineer, current nuclear plant operator in training. Edit: HiddenCamper is more correct. While the plant would still have power for quite a while, containment cooling is not automated and therefore containment would eventually overheat and cause system failures well before the 7 day mark. Were there an operator available to put suppression pool cooling in service, the plant could feasibly keep the core cooled automatically for quite a while as I said above, though I am assuming nothing breaks after running continuously for days and days.

Generation 3+ plants (none in commercial operation yet), do have up to 1 week of walk away safety, but require operator actions to ensure long term core cooling. The bottom line is you can't leave a nuclear reactor. It takes a year or more before decay heat is low enough to prevent a zirconium fire and core melt or spent fuel pool fire. Operators like myself are licensed at the plant and we cannot leave our watch station until someone else with a license turns over with us. So every day I go in, I cannot leave until someone else who is licensed and qualified for my position takes over. I've done some long shifts due to people calling in sick. As for the plant side: you have to monitor and maintain equipment. Pumps need oil. Tanks need water filled (or drained). Systems need pressure vented. This stuff happens day to day, so without operators, equipment will fail and the plant will trip. Best case scenario, you cool the plant down to cold shutdown and leave it in shutdown cooling mode. If power trips off or anything malfunctions you'll lose core cooling again though, as shutdown cooling typically doesn't have auto restarts. Bottom line: you can't leave a nuclear reactor.

Most plants are so ridiculously automated it's not even funny. Even the older ones.As someone stated though the lack of load would cause the generators to trip and with that happening the reactor would trip because there's nothing to take the load. Nuke plants aren't great at varying loads so a sudden drop off in load usage would cause it all to shutdown for safety reasons automatically. When we had that big power outtage many years ago on the east coast the plants all went into shut down because the systems all tripped as there was a sudden lack of load as far as the generators were concerned and all the reactors went into safety \"OH shit our powers got nowhere to go\" mode and started shut down processes. Which sometimes causes problems as the back ups for some plants are primarily fed from the grid (backups used if not acailable) but because the whole grid went down some back ups didn't do what they should have.Source: Am Nuclear Operator Edit:Few questions were asked.1) Depending on the age of the plant, in a perfect world they should technically run without any human intervention for quite awhile. That said no plant runs perfectly so it could be as short as a day before lack of humans causes it to shut down or a few weeks. As someone said they have entire shifts of people for the reactors I'm at at all times and they're integral to making sure it runs smoothly but even without us it generally can run for awhile before issues arise and it shuts down, but it's also a much older so without us it'd fall apart.2) The simulated load is incredibly low as the plants can't really run if there's nothing to draw the load. It's hard to just have electricity go to nothing and it's hard to pretend there's a load that can use up the pure energy a nuclear reactor puts out. Nuclear reactors do not handle adjusting their power very well and at relatively high numbers begin to poison themselves out if the level is too low. Something like 60%, I think I can't remember, reactor power causes it to be overwhelmed by it's byproducts to the point where it can't keep going and has to basically be shut down restarted after x amount of hours so that it can decay enough to not cripple the reaction. The simulated load would have to be equal to a load above poisoning levels and that's obscenely high. Generally if the generator detects no load drawing from it, it has no choice but to basically be like \"Mr reactor you need to turn off or shit going to go Cray.\"3)Most reactors built nowadays generally have a ton of safety features to hopefully power cool the reactor and poison it out to the point where the reactions stop. However... the fuel is still hot. Really fricken hot. Without the water circulating through it constantly there could be some huge issues. I work at a CANDU reactor. We use heavy water as our heat transfer medium. One of our in case of emergency cool and poison the reactor mediums is a large eater tower that gravity feeds normal light eater into the reactor as that cools and absorbs the reactor faster than the current heavy water in it. However.. It's designed for 1 reactor messing up hard and hoping people can shut the others down (all reactors are independent system wise so that faults on one isn't faults on all 4). Another feature they have assuming 100% lack of power (no back up generators for emergencies) the system is designed to go for as long as it can on a thermal flow option... like, the hot water will flow through the system cool and return back, which they got to test in real life by accident during the black out because the faults were so bad. However it only last so long. The systems probably would never breach containment if it got too hot honestly however the plant itself would be a terrible place to be with how their systems are set up. A meltdown on the levels of what has happened with 3 mile and fukushima are interesting edge cases of poor decision or poor design. Fukushima actually caused my plant to put safeties in place in case something were to happen here... Even though we are nowhere near fault lines. Meltdowns are honestly a hard thing to judge. It depends on how containment is built. It's such a plant by plant basis that it's impossible to say how every plant would react.Edit 2:First off sorry I don't have much for sources. It's mostly the courses we took in training and operating procedure and most of it's not really linkable.Most plants are designed yes to just shut down the reactor if a problem arises and no human interaction occurs. The rods at most meant for poisoning the reactor out and shutting it down are gravity held up by electronic means. If no power, rods drop and kill the reaction really fast.Also the reason the load matters isn't for the reactor itself. It's for the generators. If they aren't using the steam from the reactor to power anything there's almost no reason for the reactor to be running so it would begin to shut itself down. Also my plant will never be re-tubed if that helps. Too old. On her last legs. Which is why we have to be more involved with plant operations, older plant with lots more terrible manual valves and etc.Plants are designed to have as much automation in its processes as technologically available at the time of construction, and as such as time goes on newer plants have more sustainability assuming peak conditions.Side note: If you want to get into it go for it but be warned rotating 12 hour shifts which we have are absolutely the worst.

But in the last decade, blue states have become increasingly reliant on \"millionaire's taxes\" imposed on very high incomes.**>New York has a top tax rate of 8.82%, but married couples only pay it if they make more than $2.14 million. (New York City levies additional taxes on top of that.) In California, state income taxes top out at 13.3%, but only if your family makes at least $1 million a year.>**States have had some success collecting revenue from these taxes without inducing too many high-income people to move away, in part because the state and local tax deduction reduces the tax benefit from moving.**>**If the deduction is abolished even just for the highest earners, that could put blue states under fiscal stress. These taxes would become both more politically problematic and more economically challenging to levy, so states might face pressure to shift the tax burden to the middle class or cut government spending**.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 182899, "stickied": false, "score": 12, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 15 05:39:23 2017", "ups": 12}, {"body": "Blue states already fund the burden of federal government.

Bernie was not a democrat, he was an independent that became a Democrat.  De Leon should understand the importance of not impugning the character of his fellow democratic colleague.Second I see no reason to negatively look at either one of these politicians.

If they are clicking through the dialogs when they open a file, they may very well be doing the same with any warnings from AV software, or opening random phishing links.Thankfully, most companies that are large enough for that to be a concern institute group policies and domain policies which turn off the \"update automatic links at open\" option in Office programs so neither prompt appears unless they specifically choose the field in question and update it.

When i tried to look nice i just couldnt look like them, i had dark frizzy tangly hair which could never be tamed, my attempts at make up made me feel humiliated, i was not skinny or sexy or hot, i couldnt get myself to like the things they liked, i couldnt behave mildly, i couldnt talk or walk like them, i was so awkward. i had no one around me who knew how to do any of these feminine beauty things, i thought to myself that i would never be a real woman, i would never attract men because i just wasnt beautiful and just some kind of inbetween person. The boys thing didn't turn out to be true! My boyfriend now is very very masculine, it makes me think about myself, he really knows that he is a man and i'm somewhat jealous of his certainty. I love to do male orientated things with him like watch and talk about football, DIY, manual garden jobs, watch gritty manly action films and male orientated comedies, play FIFA and GTA, listen to very male orientated music. Maybe i dont leave enough room for other less masculine activities or subjects. i dont get along well with other women, not because im rude to them but just because i dont have much in common with most other girls. I'm not a very masculine dresser, i like girls clothes but i usually end up dressing exactly like a man and although feeling confident, i also feel lost and frustrated, overwhelmed with 'man-ness' then looking at other girls and feeling sad like i could never ever be like them if i tried. a few times i tried to do the whole thing, but it just made me feel very tired and defensive, then i just felt inferior and like no one took me seriously. I really want to be able to see the woman in me and recognise it, i would love to be able to realise inside myself that i am a woman, i know that i conversate and think like a woman, just not a confident or attractive one. For 4 years i identified as a trans man, but now i feel that this is wrong for me, i know that my issues come from how i think about women, and how difficult it is to deal with all these things women are expected to do to themselves, as well as biological things women get. I know that I want to change but I realise that I can never be like the girls i tortured myself over at school and at uni and just in the street everywhere.

It is true: The number one fear of women when online dating is to meet a serial killer... and for men, it's to meet a fat woman. Let that sink in for a moment. So I thought to myself, this study was done using Tinder. People on Tinder are there to hook up. Right? (I've never used the app) But that still means what men hate the most is hooking up with an overweight woman. Then everyone wonders why girls are at such high risks of Eating Disorders, why we almost all hate how we look, etc. This is the fucking reason! Not just that \"Men\" think this way, no, but the fact that everyone seems to think this way. So I went to the only man in my life to ask what he thought. To my utter shock and despair, he thought this was a legit fear to have. Here's the thing : I'm not talking about cat-fishing. Like, posting someone else's photo. No, I'm talking about posting your *best* photo in which you might not look as heavy. It's called the art of taking pictures! lol He said seeing fat women makes him think they are lazy. That skinny girls \"take care\" of themselves and have discipline. That's such a flawed argument. I know a ton of overweight people who have a lot of discipline - just not with Exercise or Food, but they are great at other things that also requires discipline. Then I tried to get him to understand that he was judging people based on their looks - and that is my main problem with this. So he said that's all he cares about. The looks. That he doesn't care if the really hot girl is a total idiot, because she's gonna look good to his friends/everyone else no matter what and that's all that matters. Granted, I asked a 21 year old this and it's so easy to say that men at shallow at that age... but why do I feel like he represents a huge number of people? I'm overweight. I hate my body. I hate everything about me. I actively avoid taking pictures of myself, but on the rare occasion that someone forces me to take one or to be in one... when I see myself, I physically feel pain. In my chest, in my stomach. I hate how I look, and I don't think I will ever be able to change this because unless I can manage to look like Kendall Jenner... nothing's gonna be good enough. So my question is... what the fuck is going on? I'm sick of feeling so miserable and crying myself to sleep. I'm sick of turning to food for comfort. I can't exercise or go on diets, because I want that perfect body yesterday! I want this awful, lumpy, ugly, saggy body off of me. I'm abusive to myself. I used to cut, and I haven't done that in almost 2 years... but I think about it. A lot. At 24, it's scary how ugly and sad I feel. And whomever I speak to just says the same... fat people are lazy/undisciplined/miserable and they don't want that. They don't care who that person is on the inside, as long as the outside is shitty - they want nothing to do with it. It's unfair, it's painful, it's disgusting and I feel totally justified hating myself. Everyone else does.

I have insufficient glandular tissue in breasts, IGT. Also called tuberous breasts. Google it. It's pretty bad. I gained a crapload of weight when I got pregnant, haven't lost it, have stretch marks everywhere, couldn't breastfeed, which caused even more self-confidence issues for a load of reasons, and I have wrinkles now. I'm 27.It's suuuper hard for me to love myself. But I do, because regardless of how my stupid, lumpy, screwed up body looks, my soul is in here. My soul and my heart and my mind are in here, and they have value.  Your sould and your heart and your mind are in that body. And they absolutely have value. If someone disagrees, then they're not someone you need in your life. The biggest thing I have learned from becoming a mother is that I have to set the example I want my daughter to see. If I place value on myself, others will either see it, or fuck off. Think of it like this: some of the most expensive designer purses are ugly as shit. But they're still going to sell for 11,000 dollars. Because someone put that price tag on it, and someone, somewhere, is willing to pay that. Write your own price tag. Do not undervalue yourself. Sure, most people are window shoppers. They can't afford it, or they don't think it's worth it. But someday, someone will be willing to write that check. Do not put yourself on clearance. I hope that you read all of this, and I apologize for any formatting errors or spelling errors. I'm on mobile. That's how much I hear you and care that you read this. My fingers are gonna fall off, because I want you to know how important it is that you learn to love yourself. Seriously, nobody is going to waste their time on you if you think of yourself as worthless, but if you value yourself more, others will pick up on it.

So my fiances father got a shitty r.v. to try and convince us to stay in the house (rather then moving to an apartment complex with a sketchy reputation) but we knew he would still invade our space and be in the house when ever he wants( I mean why would two young lovers want a fucking parent in the house ALL THE GOD DAMNED TIME if you know what I mean) and  sleep in the r.v. which would never leave the driveway anyways. And the way the tow truck dropped off the r.v. it pushed all our parking spots in the drive way to the left now and when I get home before my fiance does I make sure to give myself room to back out by parking how I normally did BEFORE the r.v. was there becuase I dont have much experience maneuvering out of tiny spaces. Before today I parked more to the left and when I would have to go to work in the morning I would have to wake my fiance to move his car becuase he parked so close to me becuase his dad pretty much put the r.v. in his old spot which made everyone move over. Tonight I came home from going through the drive through and he asked me to re park so my fiance could have room to park (mind you theres loads of other places to park on our giant dirt driveway AND all three of our cars could fit with me having enough room to get out if he would just pull in closer to us I r.v. but he doesn't)  I told him no becuase its inconsiderate if him to think everyone's just going to move over for his r.v. and still have room to get out and said 'I didn't park it sideways in the driveway..are you drunk?' (This was all over text message) and I said 'haha no I guess this makes the move easier for my fiance just keep acting like an ass and see where it gets you'd and he told me not to talk to him so I'm irked and waiting for my fiance to get home and wanted to vent thanks reddit.
