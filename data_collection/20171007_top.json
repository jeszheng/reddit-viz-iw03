She also knows my Reddit account, so... hi there :)So I had my first teenage love at the ripe age of 16. We dated for 2 years, we learned a lot and we quickly matured. We loved each other so much.Then the good/bad news. Senior year we applied to the same schools. She got into UCLA, I didn't and I got into NYU, she didn't. We were so torn. I remember both of us so happy that we got into nice schools, but we realized we'd be apart. We cried so much that day. I'll never forget it. We were inseparable and we tried to talk it out. We tried to reason. We could call, text, set up skype dates! But I think we both knew in the back of our mind that we needed to be single for our next chapter in life. This was our biggest heartbreak. I remember her crying on my shoulder in my room. I was holding back tears. I told her everything was going to be okay, and that we'll still be in touch. I remember my main goal was for her to feel better. One day while eating ice cream in our favorite spot under a big willow tree, I told her that we should be single as we start our next chapter. We both agreed, even though it was so hard for both of us. I let her know this is to protect both of us from temptation and that I didn't want to hold her back from partying and experience college.She let me know that she wanted the best for me too. I'll never forget this.\"Voscility, can you promise to never forget about me?\" - Of course, you're my first and only the timing of our relationship is causing us to split.\"Voscility, what if life gets in the way and we go our separate ways? What if we find someone else and we drift apart?\" - It's possible, but I'll always remember you and try to keep in touch.\"Voscility, can you promise me that you'll reach out to me when I'm 25?\" - I'm going to set a calendar reminder right now. I promise.As you guessed, the first year was tough. We kept in touch and still talked on a regular basis.  I saw her social medias partying with new friends and I wished I was there. Our busy student lives got in the way and one day I saw her facebook relationship status change to \"in a relationship with __\". I felt like a truck hit my chest. I cried that day like I've never cried. She moved on, she found someone else. Even though we were both single for a while, it sucked.We still messaged here and there, but it was evident I was no longer a priority. I deleted all my social medias, and continued with my life. Fast forward 7 years to this summer, I've been through two relationships, living in the city, in my third year of residency. I'm studying at a cafe and my phone vibrates. I glance over and it's a calendar reminder. \"Reach out to ___ she's 25 today.\" My heart flutters, my mind goes insane. I totally forgot. It's been 7 years, and I have so many questions.I start digging around and quickly found out that she changed her number. I spent a solid hour thinking of what to say, only to type: \"Happy 25th birthday :)\" Response couple minutes later- \"Hey thanks, who's this?\" After revealing myself and telling her I remembered to reach out on her 25th birthday, I found out that she lives in NJ working as a paralegal while going to law school! We make plans to meet up, we catch up. It's like nothing changed, still beautiful as ever, smart, and motivated. I found out that she's single and so am I. I asked \"Why did you want me to reach out when you're 25? It was really random.\" \"Well Voscility, I was hoping we were both single by then and -\" a waitress cut us off because we stayed for 5 hours and I'll never forget what the waiter told us. \"Guys, you ordered two coffees and stayed for close to 5 hours, that'll be tree fiddy\", then I realized the waitress was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

Weirdest interview of my life. Real names have been changed. I was looking for the next job after leaving my first job postgrad.I had been looking for a job for two months, when I finally decided to reach out to a recruiter, Toby. Toby found a place looking for a financial analyst, a similar role to my previous job. Toby warned me that the culture is loose, but professional. As in, the employees razz each other harshly, curse, dress a little more casually, may have brewed beer in office once, yadda yadda. Toby said \u201cYou were in a fraternity, so you will understand. They are hard on you in a good, \"thick skin\" kind of way. It\u2019s a different, but fun outgoing culture.\u201d I hadn\u2019t had an interview for two weeks that wasn\u2019t sales, and they were the first place offering something close to my previous salary in a while. I get in early and wait for the interviewer. The guy who is interviewing me comes up and introduces himself as Jim. The interviewer has some banter with the receptionist for a minute before we begin. They go back and forth, until Jim ends it be saying goes \u201cOh, shut the f\u2014\u0000 up Pamela.\u201dThe interviewer, Dwight, asks me what I thought of his comment to the receptionist. In my head, I thought, \u201cLet\u2019s see where this goes.\u201d I tell him I've seen the culture enough, my parents are both blue collar, and it\u2019s just a relaxed culture that works hard. I\u2019ve been around that culture my whole life And then.....the music starts. They played some Sinatra to start off, some Journey I think, classic rock kind of songs. We get through another two or three interview questions, with the music getting louder and louder, until I have to intently listen to the interviewer. Dwight hands me a 10 minute financial test, which the recruiter Toby had prepped me for. I asked the interviewer what the music is about, and Dwight said \u201cThat\u2019s our president. He is playing loud music because you're interviewing.\u201d As if on cue by God Himself, \u201cWelcome to the Jungle\u201d starts playing. The test is relatively easy, especially as I had been prepped for it by the recruiter. (Quick ratio, debit/credit, etc.) The interviewer leaves for 8 minutes, and comes back to pressure me to hurry for the last 2 minutes of the interview. We finish discussing the test, and move on to talking about what activities I did in college, where I live, all of those things. Mid-answer, another guy named Jim just walks in. This second person came into a closed door conference room, mid question and introduced himself. This is super odd for sure. Jim starts asking where I'm from, what do I like to do, etc. It's a display of cool, casual culture. I thought I should display I can be casual too, switching from doing one thing to just chatting. The company is big on this culture: casual, but professional. Conversational, but results oriented. We talked about college sports, intramurals, my last professional organization, club sports, etc.......  Jim recently broke his wrist, so he talked about the \"damn Mexicans\" pushing him over during a soccer game. Jim leaves, and Dwight and I continue talking about second round interviews. Since I didn\u2019t have many other bites, I thought , \u201cWhy not?\u201d I didn\u2019t really have anything to lose with a second interview. The second round was much worse, and involves a MAGA hat, a secret handshake, and a bucket full of piss.

You're going to change a lot over the next 10 years. Use this time to learn about the things you want and you feel are important to you - Figure out how to be in a relationship and things that aren't so good. Yea I know it hurts being dumped, it's totally a real feeling but use these times as a learning tool.- When you're younger your friends are people you just conveniently grew up close to and gravitated towards. The people you were friends with in High School may not be your friends in college and you probably wont talk to most of them in your adult life. You don't owe anyone anything. Don't be a dick but don't feel pressured to be a part of things you don't want to be a part of.- Start saving money early. The earlier you start investing into your future/retirement/whatever-else the further that dollar will go in the future. Even if you start just putting $5/month away in a savings account at 16 it'll help build better habits for when you're older and able to put away much more.- College is important, unfortunately. Unless you're planning on attending a trade school and building up a career that way, which is totally fine, don't ignore your college work and a bachelor degree. Yes you can get by with less [I have an associate's and live on my own with my fiance and we're not struggling] but it's much harder because many employers wont even look at your resume without that degree - Even if it's in something completely unrelated.- Don't ignore fun. As you get older bills pile up and it gets harder and harder to do big extravagant things. Plan to do interesting things like spending $1,000 on a small vacation or going to see your favorite band play live. These kinds of memories live with you and even though you may \"go for broke\" every once in awhile it can usually be worth it.- Don't ignore your teeth. Fucking seriously, so many kids do this and skip brushing every once in awhile because they don't notice a difference. That difference will catch up to you when you're 25 and paying out of pocket for a root canal because one of the teeth you totally ignored for a little while and had a small cavity grew into a really big problem. . .- Make connections early. You don't have to be friends with everybody but be polite to everyone.

I think anything <60hrs is still within a normal workload.  70-80 is what you find in more demanding jobs, which can flex as high as 100 on occasions. 100 is pretty rough though and not sustainable for more than a month.  You usually also have a refractory period after that too.I think the short answer though is that anyone with those types of jobs see their work/career as their passion and a large part of who they are, so there is less divide between what they would consider work and free time.  No one is punching in their time card when they hit their XXhrs for the week and calling it a day, they're perpetually thinking about work and doing things for their job.  From someone who works on the upper end of that spectrum, I can say that the line is blurred for me and I often enjoy socializing and working with my coworkers.  Sometimes throughout the week, you go out drinking or to restaurants with coworkers, business partners, or potential new business partners, so that gives you a chance to break away from the desk too.  I also usually try to squeeze in an hour at the gym 3 times a week and always go with friends from work.The thing people don't think about is running normal errands, as it's tough working around normal working hrs for other businesses.  So when I get a chunk of true free time, I'll usually catch up on errands and sleep.  I try to multi-task too, so will often call friends I don't work with to catch up while I run errands.  Besides that, I happen to be an extreme sports fan, so I like to get into those sorts of activities like skydiving or kite surfing when I can.  I'm also a fan of vacationing with friends, although that's not part of a normal month.What's missing from the above is a chronic lack of sleep.

Then I took a shower, because I was too exhausted last night after coming home from work last night to do so.After that I went around town paying bills and dealing with finances that should have been done last weekend, but the whole \"I work so much I should just live in my cubicle thing\" prevented it.  Ingredients to be used for lunch, by request of my mother, were also picked up.  On the way home I did an errand for a local charity I have a soft spot for.Getting home, I thought I'd have the time to prepare for a Starfinder game I'd been planning to attend for a few weeks.  However, I was then informed I had to escort my elderly father on a wild goose chase of a shopping trip, and when my mother learned where we were going she decided we had to get take-out for lunch, and to hell with the ingredients purchased specifically for her lunch.

The take-out was also incorrect, for reasons locked away in a part of my mother's senile mind.  Maybe dealing with all that exacerbated a health condition of mine, because the pain flared up and I spent an hour in bed.After that I got up, mailed payment on a bill, and stressed-ate the meal my mother said wasn't good enough for her.Right now I'm sitting on my back porch, enjoying the nicest day I can remember experiencing this year.

Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you\u2019re so smart, why ain\u2019t you rich?'

If I can serve as a bridge in that intergenerational gap, it's very fulfilling for me.I can also influence young people I turn.

I know it can be weird and maybe a little creepy when I tell a young woman \"hey, you should come to my place and hang out\".

Curious, I ask who 'they' is because 1.) theres really nothing to see between her and I, and we've both grown up doing the drive, and spent a lot of time where shit lived and 2.) I was unaware she was bringing anyone.  Well she's bringing some foreign dude thats like 5 years her junior (she was like 28 at the time).  Okay, weird.  But she's my sister.  She shows up sometime the next day, and what I think is going to be a 1-2 night thing ends up being a 5 night thing where I wasn't sure if she was still staying with me or not.  She would lock the door to the downstairs (where the guest bedroom was) and they would go out at night and sometimes not come home at all.  My ex was calling my mom complaining about her, and I tried to tell my sister she needed to leave but she wasn't around enough for me to tell her.

Apparently it was the grave of an old family friend, maybe his babysitter, idk. My coworker and I talked to them for a short time. He seemed alright, but clearly he had been going through some tough times.Around then the small funeral procession for the girl shows up. I've seen a lot of funerals working here, and you could tell the family was taking it even harder than usual. We lowered the casket in and kept our distance while the family did their thing. Apparently one of the people from the church made a comment about the girl committing suicide, and this causes her brother to lose it. He starts screaming at the guy and shaking him. Then, he gets into the grave and cries out to his sister. As this is happening, the guy visiting the other grave from earlier steps up, clearly upset by all this. Turns out he was the girl's Ex and the family apparently blamed him for the suicide. He gets into the grave and starts wrestling the brother, telling him that he loved the girl more than any of then ever could.The funeral party eventually pulled the two of them out and separated them. It was clear that this wasn't over. I heard that later they fought again, and actually got over their differences and realized they both loved her and it was neither of their faults.

This displacement of them hitting the folds and then into each other, and then back into the folds over 0.0046 seconds, is wave-like in nature.These sound waves then travel up the vocal tract, and are further affected by resonators, which somehow give the voice timbre because they affect the sound frequencies to produce different pitches.Questions:#1.

Most of the things he does that make the news boil down to 'said or tweeted something rude that made people mad'. And that isn't the kind of thing that makes history. The things people remember about a president's legacy are wars fought, laws passed, and total body count. As far as laws and executive orders, yes, he banned foreign Muslims from the country and transgendered people from the military. But I think any Republican president would've at least tried to do something along those lines. Those aren't eccentric whims; they're basic party goals, for which he had a lot of support. And while they're both terrible and discriminatory, you can't link them to a direct body count.And when I say direct, I mean direct. Look at Andrew Jackson. He personally shot someone in a duel for accusing him of cheating at gambling. What would Trump have done in that situation? Most likely written an angry tweet about his opponent. Jackson sent thousands of Native Americans to their deaths on the Trail of Tears. And a lot of people still remember him mostly for how tough and cool he was. Trump has ... tried to stop immigrants from entering the country? That's cute. Less than a hundred years ago we put a ton of Japanese immigrants who were American citizens into concentration camps. I get that everything that happens in politics seems like a huge deal when it's happening, but Trump hasn't secured his legacy yet. When the years pass and the pain fades, the things people tend to remember are unique stories like the time you beat up your assassin with a hickory cane. Not the feelings you hurt or the lives you ruined.Internationally, Trump is widely disliked and embarrasses us. But he has yet to start a war. If he does end up nuking North Korea, that's the kind of thing that actually will end up in history books. History is like the news: if it bleeds it leads. A hundred years from now, the racism stuff is going to be sort of like Thomas Jefferson owning slaves: unpleasant by modern standards but dismissed as \"oh yeah, everybody in the past was super racist, I think that was back in the days when black people were banned from buses or something, right?\".

A prime example of a man who is not up to the tasks that history has set before him.1. He voted to approve several of Trump's nominees before he realized he was getting blowback for it. Now before you mention the very real fact that Republicans had enough votes to approve the nominees I want you to ask yourself what the purpose of the Minority Leader is. If nothing else his symbolic vote would have been more significant than that others. His early capitulations were not good.2. He's a hyena who feeds off of whatever the banks feed him. Go take a look at his lifetime contributions from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Bear Stearns, and the like. The number of Democratic Senators who have taken more money from these groups can be counted on one hand. Ironically, Herr Trump and his family have donated more to Charles Schumer's campaigns then they have donated to any other Senator. He stinks of manufactured opposition. 3. \u201c$250,000 makes you really rich in Mississippi but it doesn\u2019t make you rich at all in New York...\" said the plainspoken man of the people, Charles Schumer. Nevermind the fact that the median income in NYC is $54,000 and in Buffalo it's $38,000. He's frequently taken positions that favor \"exceptional\" Americans rather than the average American, and has rarely found a tax cut for this group that he didn't like. It is a foregone conclusion that he will sell us out whenever the GOP gets around to their \"tax-reform\", anyone who thinks otherwise is naive at best.4. \u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\u201d He's full of shit, and has all the grace of intellect of a three toed sloth. Way to read the tea-leaves you navel-gazing dolt.5. \"............................\" What Charles had to say as Occupy Wall Street was birthed, went nowhere, then died on his front lawn. Not a single real comment or stance in regards to one of the largest sustained mobilizations of pissed off constituents in recent history. Kinda makes his shaming of republican congressmen who are avoiding town halls look a little hypocritical, no? If a hovel town of hobos set up camp on your front lawn I bet you'd have something to say about it. His \"Better Deal\" and pivot toward economics in the context of this is laughable.6. The man is the epitome of the old trope about the statesman who only shows up for photo-ops and ground-breaking ceremonies. Even prior to the Trump ascendancy the guy never saw a camera he didn't like. Which is all well and good, but speaking as someone who has spent the last sixteen years living in his state it's a bit infuriating. I just now looked through a record of legislation he has introduced in his time in the Senate, outside of post-offices he has introduced three pieces of legislation that directly effected the good citizens of New York.7. He's actively worked against the divestment movement both nationally as well as in his home state. This is utterly baffling to me. People and institutions should have the right to separate what they invest from funding organizations and causes that are antithetical to their beliefs. Ultimately his stance on this makes sense within the context that it would hurt the financial institutions who fund him if individuals were free to divest themselves from things like giant banks. Oh yeah, and Israel. Forgot about that.8. He helped undermine the public option during the original ACA debates. When republicans balked at a strong public option he introduced a weak public option as a compromise and then later quietly scuttled that once the conversation had moved on. Many fingers got pointed at Joe Lieberman, which is fair, but a portion of the blame lays with the party leading the negotiation, to not do so would be the definition of myopic. Anyone counting on Chuck to get a reasonable compromise out of any proposed Republican healthcare legislation is putting their faith in the wrong man.9. He co-sponsored a bill to make the boycotting of Israel by any public or private entity illegal. Regardless of where you stand on Israel this is a direct and flagrant attack on the first amendment. People have the right to peaceably assemble as well as to express their political opinion, an organized boycott is a form of that kind of expression. The mere act of introducing the bill paves the way for our government to pass a prohibition on any kind of boycott.10. He voted to sell arms to the Israeli's multiple times and more recently Saudi Arabia. To me it would seem that selling arms to countries in an unstable part of the world might be problematic. I mean especially if the two sides ended up fighting each other, holy war profiteering batman. Heh, that works on two levels. It's not like Saudi Arabia funded and abetted anyone who ever hurt an American though. The vote passed by a margin of 53-47, in theory his opposition... Especially as Senate Minority leader could have swung the vote in the other direction.11. A very minor gripe, but he has remained steadfast in his opposition to signing on to the introduced 'Medicare for All' legislation even as now nearly a dozen other senators, including the other New York senator, have. Again, as minority leader there were easy points to score here against republicans by showing a united front even if there was no actual intent or means to pass such legislation. He has nothing to lose by supporting this, and yet either doesn't want to share the spotlight or can't afford to appear hostile to his donors. This man is my Senator, and I could go on for hours. The fact that he is a shit-stain is largely covered up by the automatic deference his position elicits and the cowardice of a public afraid to expect better in trying times, that and turfing... very probably turfing.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 42086, "stickied": false, "score": -91, "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 18:57:03 2017", "ups": -91}], "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/354363-schumer-i-told-trump-obamacare-repeal-was-off-the-table", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "green": 0.33669212460000003}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": 0.28270405530000003, "top_comments": [{"body": "As a reminder, this subreddit [is for civil discussion.](/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil)In general, be courteous to others.

While we're at it, it should have an SD card slot, but, again without the bulk of an SD card slot. Also, since accessing the SD card is at times annoying, it should have enough onboard storage that I won't really need the SD card at all.It should be big enough to read the screen from a foot away, but small enough to fit in my hand.  I have a smaller than average hand and hate when phones don't acknowledge this!It should have stock Android, but with all the features I like that the Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. versions have, without any of the features I hate. They also need to bring over the iOS features I long for, without ripping Apple off. It should be exactly the same as an iPhone, but also completely different, so as not to be an iPhone clone.The screen should have no bezels, but something on the sides, so I don't have any accidental touches. Also, with a bezel-less phone, I hate the speakers being in the way of a full screen. So, move them, but also have stereo front facing speakers. I'd also like a built in kick stand, but not a flimsy one. But not too bulky, because, like I said, I don't like bulky phones.We need a headphone jack, even though I personally don't really use it, since my Bluetooth headphones are more convenient. But it should definitely be there, just not on the top or bottom. It should use some kind of standard USB port, but not the old one, which is too slow.I don't like how metal conducts heat, so the back should be glass  But, glass breaks easily, so not glass, but something like glass.

When is Google going to realize that they need to fire their engineers and just listen to customers?  Especially the customers whose opinions contradict each other?I personally want a thin phone that's thick enough not to break, but thin enough to fit into my pocket along with my wallet, keys, loose change, etc.  It should also have a huge battery, without the bulk of a huge battery. While we're at it, it should have an SD card slot, but, again without the bulk of an SD card slot. Also, since accessing the SD card is at times annoying, it should have enough onboard storage that I won't really need the SD card at all.It should be big enough to read the screen from a foot away, but small enough to fit in my hand.  I have a smaller than average hand and hate when phones don't acknowledge this!It should have stock Android, but with all the features I like that the Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. versions have, without any of the features I hate. They also need to bring over the iOS features I long for, without ripping Apple off. It should be exactly the same as an iPhone, but also completely different, so as not to be an iPhone clone.The screen should have no bezels, but something on the sides, so I don't have any accidental touches. Also, with a bezel-less phone, I hate the speakers being in the way of a full screen. So, move them, but also have stereo front facing speakers. I'd also like a built in kick stand, but not a flimsy one. But not too bulky, because, like I said, I don't like bulky phones.We need a headphone jack, even though I personally don't really use it, since my Bluetooth headphones are more convenient. But it should definitely be there, just not on the top or bottom. It should use some kind of standard USB port, but not the old one, which is too slow.I don't like how metal conducts heat, so the back should be glass  But, glass breaks easily, so not glass, but something like glass.  And not plastic, either. So, get on that, Google!  Oh, and the Pixels are too expensive, so make the price no more than $300.

I was traveling for work with a male coworker and we hit the karaoke bar. Me and the coworker were actually sleeping together at the time in a FWB arrangement and we were psyched that our travel schedules synced up, so it was definitely not him - actually he didn't have a very fun night after it happened. We'd gotten off the plane, dropped our stuff at our hotel, went out for a beer and ended up at a really crowded karaoke place. We each got a beer, drank it slowly enough that the bouncer guys made us buy another one (not sure how it is now, but at the time NOLA bars on Bourbon street had rules that you had to buy a drink or a coke every 30 minutes or you had to leave) We each got a second beer and halfway through it I felt... drunk. Like I had suddenly gone from sober to drunk in the space of a minute or two. My head was swimming and I couldn't keep focus with my eyes and the thought of taking another sip of beer nauseated me. I told coworker guy how I felt and he said we should get fresh air - outside I was just so head swimmy I asked to go back to the hotel. Don't remember getting there. Do remember trying to get a drink of water and the glass falling from my hand in the hotel bathroom, shattering on the floor and then I stepped in it and tracked blood all over the hotel room. Passed out face down on one of the beds. Coworker patched up my foot while I was out and cleared up the broken glass but there was still bloody footprints on the carpet in the morning. God knows what the cleaning staff thought. He stayed up taking my pulse and checking my breathing and temp because he didn't know what else to do. In the morning I felt legitimately hung over, like as bad as if I had been blackout drunk - I had had only had 1 full and perhaps 1/4 of a second light beer total.  The next day during work meetings we started wondering if I'd gotten a drugged drink. At the time it wasn't so well known, so it wasn't the first place our minds went - but there was no other explanation. Also because people didn't talk about it as much then, I had paid no attention to my open drinks in the bar. So who knows. It will always be a mystery to me. Who did it, why did they do it when I was there with a guy, maybe I drank someone else's drink by accident - ???  Anyway coworker went back to that bar the next night and told them what he thought happened. They shrugged it off \"yeah, maybe\" and that was that. I felt like crap the entire next day, like a full 24 hour hangover, then I was fine. It really scared me though.   Whenever someone talks about getting drinks drugged I remember how I felt that night, how it was all I could do to get home WITH a completely supportive, caretaking friend guiding me. I probably just looked really drunk. I would have been a goner if that had happened to me when I was alone, or with someone I didn't know well. I had no way of taking care of myself. I didn't even feel stepping on broken glass. I didn't even wake up when someone removed the glass from my foot and washed it. I definitely wouldn't have felt any more sinister acts. The next day i felt super hung over - if I hadn't have drank such a small amount, I could even see how after  heavy night I would have just thought I'd had too much to drink. So freaking scary.

I was traveling for work with a male coworker and we hit the karaoke bar. Me and the coworker were actually sleeping together at the time in a FWB arrangement and we were psyched that our travel schedules synced up, so it was definitely not him - actually he didn't have a very fun night after it happened. We'd gotten off the plane, dropped our stuff at our hotel, went out for a beer and ended up at a really crowded karaoke place. We each got a beer, drank it slowly enough that the bouncer guys made us buy another one (not sure how it is now, but at the time NOLA bars on Bourbon street had rules that you had to buy a drink or a coke every 30 minutes or you had to leave) We each got a second beer and halfway through it I felt... drunk. Like I had suddenly gone from sober to drunk in the space of a minute or two. My head was swimming and I couldn't keep focus with my eyes and the thought of taking another sip of beer nauseated me. I told coworker guy how I felt and he said we should get fresh air - outside I was just so head swimmy I asked to go back to the hotel. Don't remember getting there. Do remember trying to get a drink of water and the glass falling from my hand in the hotel bathroom, shattering on the floor and then I stepped in it and tracked blood all over the hotel room. Passed out face down on one of the beds. Coworker patched up my foot while I was out and cleared up the broken glass but there was still bloody footprints on the carpet in the morning. God knows what the cleaning staff thought. He stayed up taking my pulse and checking my breathing and temp because he didn't know what else to do. In the morning I felt legitimately hung over, like as bad as if I had been blackout drunk - I had had only had 1 full and perhaps 1/4 of a second light beer total.  The next day during work meetings we started wondering if I'd gotten a drugged drink. At the time it wasn't so well known, so it wasn't the first place our minds went - but there was no other explanation. Also because people didn't talk about it as much then, I had paid no attention to my open drinks in the bar. So who knows. It will always be a mystery to me. Who did it, why did they do it when I was there with a guy, maybe I drank someone else's drink by accident - ???  Anyway coworker went back to that bar the next night and told them what he thought happened. They shrugged it off \"yeah, maybe\" and that was that. I felt like crap the entire next day, like a full 24 hour hangover, then I was fine. It really scared me though.   Whenever someone talks about getting drinks drugged I remember how I felt that night, how it was all I could do to get home WITH a completely supportive, caretaking friend guiding me. I probably just looked really drunk. I would have been a goner if that had happened to me when I was alone, or with someone I didn't know well. I had no way of taking care of myself. I didn't even feel stepping on broken glass. I didn't even wake up when someone removed the glass from my foot and washed it. I definitely wouldn't have felt any more sinister acts. The next day i felt super hung over - if I hadn't have drank such a small amount, I could even see how after  heavy night I would have just thought I'd had too much to drink. So freaking scary.

I hate to call him that. I love him but I've had a few family members and friends point out a few red flags and now it's seemingly obvious when it wasn't last month. A part of me just wants to think that they're just making things up, making things a bigger deal or misinterpreting it but I'm not so sure now. Maybe I'm the emotional abuser? And he's right and I'm wrong?I like walking away during fights and he's called me out and I've worked on it. I cry when I get worked up or angry and hate people seeing that when I try and defend myself so I walk away and bring the fight up later. Is that really mean of me?I moved in with him 3 months into our relationship. Looking back I can say I felt that I either move in with him or we stop seeing each other so I moved in with him after living with my parents. I had a lot of money saved up and offered to pay for groceries to pay my way while living with him. It's a big house and he'd be paying all the utilities and the mortgage (He comes from a wealthy family and could afford the house). Now that money is gone and I'm struggling to pay for groceries and he thinks it's unfair that he pays for everything else and I can't afford to get food. I'm not pulling my weight. I'm a full time student and work part time. He doesn't work. He graduated a few months back and stays home. After I'm done with school and work he wants me to do laundry, or asks what's for dinner, or asks me to mop, or dust or do the dishes, things he could have done while I was away. But I said I would when I moved in. To pull my weight. Because he pays for everything else, he's done his part. We have two dogs that I adore. I love giving them all my affection and enjoy the chore of feeding them. I noticed one looked too skinny so decided to up his amount of food one day without saying anything. I few weeks pass and he notices the dog has gained some weight and questions me about it so I explain what I did. He becomes angry that I didn't consult him first. Maybe I should have but he doesn't feed them so I thought it was ok. I bought a Christmas tree last year and put it up without saying anything. It was going to be a surprise because Christmas was great and beautiful. He became upset that I didn't put it where he wanted it. It's his house. We live in a big house but it has no decor. So I got a center piece for the coffee table to brighten things up. He hates it and asks me to throw it out. But I got my way when we picked out new sheets because I complained. He agreed on one of the colors I picked out. I just started school and have made some great friends but I don't hang out with them because when I work and go to school full time I don't spend enough time with him. And I feel guilty visiting my parents or texting my sister because it's less time with him. But I should spend time with him. He's my bf of three years and I love him. He's done so much for me. He says I did or said things I've never done like yell at him in front of his friends or called him a liar. But he was drunk and probably didn't know what was real. I'm sorry this is long but I've had this incredible need to put these things out in the open. I can't seem to get myself to bring it up any other way. I try to put in his point of view and his arguments because I don't want him to be anything other than what I've seen him to be these last 3 years and I still sometimes think I'm in the wrong. I also don't want to leave because of the aforementioned dogs. They were both adopted by him. One from before we met and the other as a gift to \"us\" last year.

If you are tenured and lose grant funding, you don't get fired, but you do lose your salary.

I was given one quiet shy little girl who I was told right off the bat was \"difficult to work with\" and nobody wanted to work with her. I didn't have any issues with this as even though I don't want kids of my own (no pregnancy for me \ud83d\ude28) I am very good and patient with kids.So I get to know her pretty well over this semester, and I quickly really just grow to love this little kid.Turns out that she was incredibly bright and very gifted. She could reliably do both math and reading work waaaaay above her skill level and completed all her work (angrily) in 5mins and then did whatever she wanted for the following almost two hours.She didn't talk to the other kids much and was hyper aggressive. She hated her school work and called it boring. I sympathized greatly with her because as a kid I was ignored and not allowed to do work at my ability level. It was disgustingly boring for me and made me angry and hate school too. So, I started bringing 4th grade level materials for her to work on (she was in kindergarten) and she took to it pretty well she floated somewhere between 3rd and fourth grade level ability based on the different books and workbooks I got her. In math as well.However, she was perpetually unhappy and angry. I knew she was in foster care with her brother, and because of that and her young age and her school so obviously not catering to her needs that she would have some problems. On top of that no one really at all EVER seemed to truly sit down and listen to her. Since she was so good at her school work, we often had lots of time to chat and talk about her behavioral problems. She would hit and grab over kids, stab herself, lie, rip up her papers, throw things, kick the chairs, and throw fits.Anyway, so one time I caught her stealing her neighbors food again for like the third time, and so I grabbed the snacks back and told her \"you know the rules, you have your snacks, which you've already eaten, and these are her snacks. You cannot take what doesn't belong to you. That was a very bad thing for you to have done, you owe your neighbor and apology. Now please apologize to her and then explain to me why you felt the need to do that even though you know the rules.\"She quickly gave the girl her cookies back and said sorry to her.But then she burst into stressed out tears and cried to me \"Please, please give me more snacks, I'm so hungry! I just want the cookies.\" She grabbed my hand across the table.I was shocked and got up moved over to her and said \"woah woah- what's going on? Didn't you eat lunch today? What did you eat? Why are you so hungry? Are you trying to trick me? You know I don't appreciate when you lie to me that's not a kind thing to do.\" But I was really disturbed that she said she was so hungry.Mind you, I had zero training for this.So I got down to her level and looked at her and said \"are you really that hungry? Aren't you going to eat dinner soon when you get home? You might spoil your dinner then.\" And then she just started sobbing while clutching my arms/legs and told me \"they don't feed me.\"The more this girl talked the more horrified I became honestly.I said \"what do you mean they don't feed you?!?? What did you have for breakfast , what is lunch like- did you eat lunch today?\"Turns out her family who housed her, her brother, and a few other foster kids, did EXACTLY what my parents did to me- food was inconsistent,reward or punishment based, and not healthy, the cheapest shit you could find, and sometimes didn't happen at all. So I reported it to the program managers, I wanted someone to do something (you can guess where this is going reddit...).They said \"Well, that's just a claim she's making . She could be lying, we will report it though to her school who will contact her case manager. Really this isn't your job, so just make sure she does her work and we will look into it.\"I was angry and said \"well, she's hungry NOW, what are we going to do about that? She's just a child you know. She's shouldn't have to be hungry here forced to learn boring shit and then suffer forced to starve until whenever the fuck she gets fed next. Can I at least give her some more snacks just a second packet?\"\"No, I'm afraid you can't- that wouldn't be fair to the other children.\"\"The other children aren't hungry like her.\"\"You can't really know that now can you?\"I just fumed in silence. I thought this was the stupidest red tape bullshit I had ever seen. Someone's hurting right here right now in front of your fucking face and you're going to write a report throw the book at me and ignore the easy solution here. So, I decided I was going to ignore the rules.I started bringing her snacks and gifts every time I came, along with new school materials like more challenging books I got from the local library. At first I brought her cookies but then, I brought real food because she would eat anything. I tried bringing fruit like apples and bananas and real food from the dining hall like teeny salads I put in Tupperware or a peanut butter jelly sandwich whatever I could manage in between work and school.Mostly brought apples and bananas though cause I often didn't have time for lunch myself either. i had 60hrs of work/classes not even including my actual studying and clubs and stuff I did. (I was one of those kids lol)There were bigger problems however. She was very suicidal. Sometimes she would come to the program sullen and angry at herself. She would say \"I hate myself I want to die. I want someone to kill me-just kill me!\" and cry in frustration and stab herself with whatever was in reach.I was so shocked. She was such a lovely bright child and so sweet she called me \"mommy\" a lot. I immediately grabbed her pencil pen ruler whatever it was and told her \"never do that to yourself, not ever. No matter how much it hurts inside, you don't deserve to punish yourself for it- for anything. You're such a good girl, you're so smart and special- why do you feel the need to do that to yourself? What's wrong?\"Her behavior really hurt to see. I remember being her age and going through the exact same thing. I remember attempting suicide at her age- so I knew what other people might take as a childish threat \"she doesn't know what she's talking about- kids can't be suicidal, she's only 5.\" Could be very real.I reported it again to the program, and this time they took it seriously. Saying she would have to be evaluated and all this other stuff. However, I was worried that they might take her out of the program because of it. That would ruin this thing we had going. Luckily they didn't. I even met her parents a couple of times (the foster ones) and tried to explain the them how bright she was and that they might be missing some of her hints because it seemed like she was having trouble communicating her needs in a way that they understood and that she was often hungry after school, and \"had they thought of having snacks ready for them?\". They parents looked aggravated and annoyed. They didn't want to hear it, grabbed her roughly and told them to stop making noise and \"hurry up and leave already.\"They were uber religious and said they didn't believe in \"sparing the rod to spoil the child\". I swear flashbacks to my childhood.I'm an atheist now but grew up with insanely religious mildly cult-y/fundamentalist parents who would always make sure to have us pray the rosary for hours and go to church minimum 3times a week but fuck *actually* taking care of you.I didn't say anything to that but merely reiterated that she was a very good hardworking girl. I smiled at her a sad smile as it broke my heart. And hugged her goodbye for the day.I couldn't make the last day with the program, but was so sad I wouldn't make our last meeting together, so I made an origami butterfly for her in super pretty paper that I got especially cause she said she liked it. She didn't have any decorations or nice things in her room and she wanted some. I wrote a quote across the butterfly wings essentially saying to \"be strong and your a good person so you'll make it out alive\" I phrased it a lot better can't remember the real quote. I wrote it on the underside so if her foster parents found it they wouldn't see it right away and destroy it. She might get to keep it if they say it was \"just\" a paper butterfly and it wasn't really meant to be encouraging.I was almost hesitant to make it for her. But I did it anyway, and told the person I gave it to to give her a snack (gave her some fruit) and to tell her she's a great kid and deserves so much more.The person was confused by this and I grabbed her and looked her dead in the eyes saying \"please do this, it's so important. Please just give her the food and butterfly and tell her she's good\".The person said they did and that my little girl liked it and took it home with her and did great (as always) on her school work. I really do hope she was/is okay.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4068, "stickied": false, "score": 8, "submission_time": "Sat Oct  7 19:36:09 2017", "ups": 8}, {"body": "I wish we could hang them in the town square.

Had it been passed as a part of the ACA law itself then the Trump admin would not have been able to roll it back due to the separation of legislative authority (which belongs to Congress).I disagree with this decision, but when you rely on the use of legislation through administration to push your agenda, which Obama did, then you run the risk of having everything you\u2019ve done reversed by the next President.

But its instead become a symbol of pride for Wall Street. The Fearless Girl was commissioned as a promotional piece for a financial advisor firm to piggyback on women empowerment. Knowing the history of both statues to me adds a greater complexity and depth. I love it even more. The image of the Fearless Girl standing in front of the Charging Bull speaks volumes and I think will stand the test of time.
