It isn't clear how advanced Mr. Mueller's investigation of the alleged plan to remove Mr. Gulen is, nor is there any indication that any money changed hands, according to those familiar with the discussions and the FBI investigation.>But federal investigators' interest in whether Mr. Flynn was pursuing potentially illegal means to forcibly deal with Mr. Gulen indicates that the former Trump adviser faces another investigation stemming from his work on behalf of Turkish government interests, both before and after the presidential election.>A lawyer for Mr. Flynn declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Mr. Flynn Jr.>Before entering the Trump administration as the president's national security adviser, Mr. Flynn was lobbying on behalf of Turkish interests in the U.S., including on the Gulen issue. He didn't disclose that work until March of this year, after he was forced out of the White House for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Mr. Flynn served as national security adviser for just 24 days.>He is now facing military, congressional and criminal investigations into allegations that he improperly concealed his financial ties to Turkey and Russia, and into whether the ties played any role in his decisions as the president's adviser, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.>One person familiar with the alleged discussions about Mr. Gulen said Mr. Flynn also was prepared to use his influence in the White House to further the legal extradition of the cleric, who lives in Pennsylvania.>Mr. Gulen's legal residency in the U.S. became a major irritant in American and Turkish relations during the Obama administration, and Turkish officials pressed for Mr. Gulen's extradition so that he could face charges. Mr. Erdogan's government has accused the cleric of masterminding a failed coup and have called him and his supporters a terrorist network. Mr. Gulen denies both accusations.>The alleged meeting in New York in December, which came after Mr. Flynn was tapped as national security adviser, was a follow-up to an earlier discussion, on Sept. 19, where Turkish officials first raised the possibility of forcibly removing Mr. Gulen. That September meeting, held in a hotel room and attended by former CIA Director James Woolsey, was reported earlier by the Journal.>Mr. Gulen's removal was discussed as \"a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away,\" according to Mr. Woolsey, who said he attended the meeting at the request of one of Mr. Flynn's business associates.>Also present at the September meeting were Mr. Erdogan's son-in-law and Turkey's foreign minister, foreign-lobbying disclosure documents show. The Turkish Embassy has previously acknowledged that Turkish officials met with Mr. Flynn but declined to discuss the conversation.>A White House spokesman deferred all questions to a spokesman for the Trump transition process.>\"We don't have any evidence that such a meeting took place,\" that spokesman said, referring to the December meeting. \"And if it did take place it happened not withstanding the transition.\">At the time the plan was discussed, Turkey had been lobbying Obama administration officials for months to release Mr. Gulen to Turkish custody and wanted to avoid a legal extradition proceeding, according to a former official with direct knowledge of Turkish and American discussions. The Obama administration rebuffed those requests, the official said.>In Mr. Flynn, the Turks found a more sympathetic ear. Mr. Flynn wrote an op-ed published in The Hill on the day of the presidential election in which he praised Mr. Erdogan's government and called the cleric \"a shady Islamic mullah\" and \"radical Islamist\" who may be running \"a dangerous sleeper terror network\" in the U.S.>\"We should not provide him safe haven,\" Mr. Flynn wrote.>Mr. Woolsey said he informed the U.S. government about the September meeting by notifying Vice President Joe Biden through a mutual friend.>The mutual friend confirmed to the Journal that he told Mr. Biden about the meeting. Mr. Biden's spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, other than to say Mr. Biden felt the Gulen matter should be handled through the courts.>Mr. Woolsey, who served briefly as an adviser to the Trump campaign, said he turned down a consulting fee from Mr. Flynn's company because of what he heard at the meeting.>Federal records show that the company, Flynn Intel Group, was paid $530,000 for advocacy work that \"could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\">Federal investigators are currently looking at whether Mr. Flynn's work on behalf of Turkey violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires people to disclose when they are acting in the U.S. on behalf of foreign powers, according to people with knowledge of the investigation.>Mr. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has been indicted by the special counsel on charges stemming from his work for the former government of Ukraine, which he didn't properly disclose to U.S. authorities, according to federal charges disclosed last month. Mr. Manafort's attorney has entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.>The Journal reported in March that Mr. Flynn had sought immunity from investigators probing Russia's interference in the presidential election in exchange for his testimony. Mr. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, wouldn't comment at the time on details of his discussions involving Mr. Flynn, but said \"General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.\">Mr. Flynn, who was fired in 2014 as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is a central figure in the sprawling special counsel investigation, which is examining whether Trump campaign or business associates coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to steal private emails from political groups and campaigns and expose them publicly. Mr. Flynn's contacts with the then-Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, have been scrutinized as part of that probe, according to people with knowledge of the investigation.>President Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia.

America is looking itself in the mirror now, reaping what we have sewn. Regardless of the initial cause, there is a silver lining of women being driven to stand up for themselves. We are seeing it in Washington and Hollywood.

Is *very* disingenuous.  Yes, the truck driver was at fault, but the accident would have been totally avoidable by a human driver.  As anyone who lives in a city will tell you, sometimes you need to throw your car in reverse, or drive into the shoulder so that a large vehicle like a truck or a bus navigating an awkward turn in a tight area can get by. At the very least, the human driver knows to lay on the horn to try to get driver of the large vehicle's attention so they can stop while cars re position.The author even nails this issue on the head later:>On the other side, the shuttle did exactly what it was programmed to do, and that\u2019s a critical point. The self-driving program didn\u2019t account for the vehicle in front unexpectedly backing up. We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked) and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck. Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss. The shuttle didn\u2019t have those responses in its program.But somehow he hand waves away the severity of the situation.  Yes this accident wasn't that big, but self-driving cars are marketed right now as infinitely more safe than human drivers, due to human error. Yet it seems as if, at least this brand, has not even been programmed to avoid a common place problem and just stood there subjecting its users to an accident.I wonder what else is not programmed into it?  If a drunk driver is weaving down the side of the road the opposite way, would the bus know it would be prudent to pull as far to the right as possible to avoid a possible head on collision that would be no fault of its own?

Of course if the capability is desired (by Intel) for privacy invasion reasons there would be no reason to trust the BIOS setup options which disable it, supposedly, the feature is designed for Server management scenarios. Further, With the BIOS options disabled none of the Management Engine features are accessible, available, or visible.The concept and implementation of what is called a \"service processor\" which services requests at a low level for remote control of the system is not new and dates from the Mainframe days. The concerns today are with regards to:-Is this feature designed to \"spy\" on users, or was it designed to facilitate remote management scenarios? This is of particular concern given recent concerns and revelations regarding the revealed activities of intelligence agencies.-Does disabling this feature prevent the abilities that are listed? For example if a system has it disabled, is it still possible to connect to ME subsystem server? Does this shut down said server software, or does it continue to run, but in an isolated and unavailable state? This would need to be determined by external inverstigation, as we start from a position of distrusting the system and cannot trust it's own self-evaluations about things like open ports and such. -If the system is not available or visible in any way when disabled, is there still some way that it can be exploited or used by a malicious third party?-If the feature is disabled, is it still available? as in, when it is disabled is this just used as a flag by connecting management software to abort or is it somehow truly isolated or unavailable?I've seen very few articles that attempt to answer these questions. Just on my own using Management Engine software I've not been able to connect to any of my systems which are recent enough to have this included.It seems like in order for this to be made into such a big deal requires an assumption about all proprietary binary blobs that they must be specifically \"out to get you\" which is a conservative and safe assumption and is the typical default position of those within Libre/Free/Open Source software movements. However the 'safe\" assumption, while in many cases is the wise choice, it is not always.

So many people are currently being caught out for crimes (like hannity) and just quote \u201cnight deplorables!\u201d As they want to ignore their faults and get a trump vs democrat fight going expecting the trump fans to run in and protect him on social media by default. Because he knows America is so divided by name calling you he gets protection.

Even though his response was removed it want to share it because I believe we all should benefit from them. Wait so your telling me Papadopoulos who is on record on a \"foreign policy advisory team\" of the Trump campaign in march 16 was never employed by trump? Or do you mean he wasn't employed because he was working with the Carson campaign up till February 16? His time has to be worth something right? Or was he aiming for a comfy  Washington gig with his new buddies so he was being nice and not charging them? Everyone gets paid one way or the other and you can't alway hide those connections. Whether it's the panama or paradise papers or something comparable in the future, heads might start rolling. But remember, the smart guys always have the fall guys when the shit hits the fan.I for one, don't like to draw conclusions. I'm interested to see how this plays out, honestly. Take what you hear though with a big ol' grain of salt though because you need to weed through the bullshit that both sides push. The thought of the cheeto orange skinned talking ballsack going down gets me as hard as any \"libtard\" as I think you might say. But again I want facts (just like we still have no proof of Russians hacking the dnc emails but msm still churned out that narrative). This will continue to play out THAT BOTH SIDES of MSM will spin. I agree more cases such as the uranium 1 and the recent dnc funding structure/agreement with the clinton campaign have to be looked into. It gets swept under the rug and there's something else that's new and flashy to take your mind off it. Sleight of hand. Mass Shootings, pedos in Hollywood [fall guys, remember ;) interesting that spacey, slick bill, and trump were on different flight records going to Epsteins island]. My point is everyone forgets about it and continues on bickering between parties without seeing what's right in front of our faces. WE are getting bamboozled!I truly am embarrassed for our population as we continue to bicker and fight amongst the two party system. What is the easiest way to control a country? Divide and Conquer. 2 little parties with figure heads people blindly follow that fight, bicker, and argue all while the cameras are on in DC and elsewhere, but behind closed door meetings you and I will never see the likes of, are getting paid hand over fist from whosever interest their pushing. Constituents? Fuck em! Corporate interests =$$$ to run more bs campaigns to get them re elected so they can continue the cycle. Meanwhile the peasants have this party loyalty so fervent, nothing will change people's minds or opinions. Echo chambers occur and both sides are fucking regurgitating  and feeding information to each other like some baby vulture National Geographic shit. Again, it's BOTH SIDES AND ITS FUCKING DISGUSTING.

What does that accomplish? To drive away anything controversial from the site?IMO if Google/Youtube was being responsible it would choose one of two options:Option 1, go with a partially curated, whitelist model for content marketed for children. This would be a new revenue source for YouTube, because they could charge an entry free for creators who want to publish to that service in exchange for the vetting process. To seed it with content upon launch the company would go and pick out suitable videos that already exist. Also, being a more exclusive platform would make views more valuable to creators who do meet standards, creating a natural motivation to uphold them by incumbents.Option 2, Stop deceiving parents by marketing your automated algorithm based kids mode that doesn't work as some sort of babysitting app and just go ahead and let YouTube be a site for adults.Also it really is the parent's fault. There are some things society accepts that parents should not let very young children do unsupervised. We don't ban cars because wandering toddlers get run over by them. It never was healthy to let very small children play with tablets and phones all day anyways, and I say this as a millenial who watched a lot of TV and had a NES to play back in the 1990s. Children that age ought to be doing something more tactile, like building stuff out of legos or riding a toy outside.I don't like age restrictions as currently implemented.

China did so in September, at least, and has been closing down many North Korean restaurants in the mainland (which is the primarily investment vehicle by North Korean businesses).North Korea repatriating their workers is likely because they have no choice but to comply with these sanctions (i.e. Their workers abroad are about to get expelled from those countries anyway).Also, I can't speak for the Russian side but last week China just re-opened direct communication with North Korea, something they haven't done for over a year. China has also resisted from adopting tougher sanctions against NK (the tourism article which made the front page the other day was somewhat deceiving in that it's 1) currently a low season for tourists right now so the ban doesn't do much, 2) the ban doesn't affect day trips meaning a lot of tourism business is unaffected and 3) implementation of economic sanctions along the border have been tough to enforce before, despite what Beijing tries to say or do). Those are signs of proactive diplomatic rebalancing rather than rapidly fraying ties. All in all the past week does not indicate anything regarding the likelihood of war breaking out on the peninsula. Nuclear war would be catastrophic for China--the fallout into its Northeast would be devastating and potentially undermine the political leadership in the county--and Beijing will do anything it can to prevent it.

By spreading out US imports over smaller (and more democratic) countries, the US would have gained more bargaining power with these smaller trade partners.

Heck, even EU countries have higher anti-dumping duties on Chinese products than the US does.Not only does China win in trade, but it also causes 600 billion dollars of intellectual property damage to the US each year. Rather than pursuing these IP violations, the US backed itself into a corner with NK and was forced to ask for Chinese help there - who demanded that the IP cases be dropped as quid pro quo.And then you have all the bad publicity - the US looks increasingly mercantilist while China comes off as a supporter of free trade, which is the exact opposite of what they actually do.This is complex game of geopolitics and macroeconomics at the highest level of global power.

Isn't a scalper just someone who realizes an inefficiency in the market? It sucks that the tickets are more expensive but the whole idea behind a free market is that price is determined by what someone is willing to pay. If you refuse to buy the higher ticket price then the scalper losses a lot of money because they aren't going to go sit in 2000 seats. If it's a question of who should be making the money I go back to saying the venue and by extension the artist should just have higher prices in the first place so that they make the money and not the guy who realizes people will pay more. And if it's a question of being fair to the public I can't think of a fairer system than who ever wants to pay the most wins the good or service.

Everyone who's come forward are evil liars! Support me even more than before so we can silence them together!\"5. Donald Trump (accused of sexual harassment and assault by multiple women, including underage girls):  \"I'm a victim! Everyone who's come forward are evil liars! Support me even more than before so we can silence them together! Bigly! Lightweights! Sad!\"6. Louis C.K (exposed himself to unwilling victims and forced them to watch, before lying about it for years): \"I did it, it is absolutely unacceptable, and I have nothing to say other than I deserve this, I've learned from my mistakes, and I'm sorry.\"What Louis did was, like he said and like all these other examples (although admittedly not quite as bad), unacceptable and disgusting, and he very likely traumatized those women for the rest of their lives. That happened, and he got called out. He does deserve this. Here's the thing: people love to see celebrities fall, because it brings these people who've enjoyed and accepted so much love and fame and success and wealth while hiding skeletons in their closets, back down to our level. We feel betrayed, so when they go down it makes us feel superior. And if they DESERVE to fall, all the better. We feel vindicated. And I feel like people never accept celebrity apologies for these reasons. But what, then, is the value of a true apology? Why do we demand repentance so much if we're going to treat repentant offenders the same way we'd treat them if they'd said \"Liars!\" or \"I'll keep doing it! Suck it, I don't care.\" I think in society we need to leave room for second chances, IF the accused completely own up to their failings like adults and don't try to run (which, to be fair, he admitted he'd been doing). Louis needs to take time off and reflect on this. And I hope this purge of sexual offenders continues. its healthy and the more women who feel empowered to step forward because of it, and the more creeps we weed out (especially the ones still doing it at the time they're busted, like Spacey and Weinstein), all the better. Maybe in a few years Louis will pull a Tiger Woods and make a humble comeback. If that happens, and if society gives him a second chance BECAUSE he owned up to this, then maybe it'll convince more accused men to apologize and not try to ruin the lives of their accusers to protect themselves.

Thinning forests is valuable to local ecosystems and better for the long term health of trees. Forests are competitive; there are only so many nutrients to go around. By thinning out underbrush, foresters ensure the trees receive their full dose of sunlight and soil. Next time you drive between forestland that has been thinned and land that hasn't, take a look at the height of the trees. You will notice that the thinned land has taller, healthier trees. By nature, forests are regenerative. You can thin out a forest, leave for 20 years, and return to a vibrant landscape full of healthy saplings.On the economic side, it is not in the best interest of foresters to clear cut forests. Why would they cannibalize their pool of resources on the first run? The goal is to return in a few decades and harvest again. The process repeats.Trees are turned into products we rely on each day. The Pulp & Paper industry makes low emotion products with high emotion resources. Paper fiber is found in everything from coffee cups, diapers, food additives, copy paper, feminine hygiene products, steering columns, concrete bridge pillars, and of course that Amazon box on your front step.The Paper industry has made great strides in water management, responsible logging practices, and waste recycling. A wood fiber can be reprocessed nearly half a dozen times. There are paper mills who only process used corrugated containers to produce new boxes. Zero virgin trees are harvested to produce their product. How neat is that?The purveying narrative is that foresters and loggers are evil, land mongers.

Tl:Dr at bottom. I felt sick all morning and started throwing up fairly nonstop around lunch time. I decided to leave uni at around 2.45pm and begin the hideous (when you're unwell) 2hr journey back home via public transport. One of my train journeys is an hour long and I decided to set up next to the wheelchair access disabled toilet which is much, much larger than the other smaller cubicle toilets on the train (I'd already learned that trying to aim into a toilet in a narrow cubicle wasn't working very well and I now had puke leftover on my shoe). I set up in one of 9 seats that are labelled as set aside for wheelchair/priority users. One other lady was using a seat so there were 7 others left free. I figured that was as fair as it could be given the circumstances.Twenty mins into the journey a guy with walking sticks requires assistance to get on the train. As the train conductor walks by I ask her if she needs me to move to another seat for the man and she says no, he can sit on one of the other seats and that it's fine. The man overhears the conversation and starts shouting loudly: \"no it's not fine! I need that seat! She needs to move!\" And he shouts this over and over as he gets on. He then spots the other lady sitting across from me and starts to shout \"she needs to move too! I need both seats so I can stretch out my legs\". And he shouts this over and over too. By then I've moved and the other lady, bless her, looks up and says \"I'm disabled too, I'm registered legally blind\". Well this guy about turns in a millisecond and starts apologising so loudly for the next ten mins about how he didn't realise she was disabled. This made me so angry. You see, I'm dyspraxic so my coordination is not good at the best of times and it means that I am technically disabled too. I'd offered to move to be polite but technically I could have argued for my own disability, I generally just choose not to as I rarely view my clumsiness as being on a par with someone who doesn't have full use of their limbs. One of the things I had done on this train journey was attempt a cup of milky tea from the service trolley to help soothe my stomach. I'd moved from a set in front of a table to a new seat, still close to the toilet, but without a table and my tea now sat on the floor. Needless to say, my lack of coordination meant that I added spilled tea to the puke already dotted on me and my own misery for the day increased. I guess the situation annoyed me because I was asked to move from a disabled spot when I actually have a hidden disability. The other person wasn't asked to move cos she pointed out that she was disabled. Kinda made me wish I'd stuck my ground and answered back. Also, there was literally nothing about how the guy was sat that suggested he couldn't have used any of the other seven free seats, I genuinely think he just wanted to make a point. Tl:Dr: I took up one of the many free 'wheelchair user' seats next to an on train toilet whilst in the middle of an exorcist worthy tummy sickness bug.

Our hours we're always getting reduced for whatever reason and in an attempt to even things out they would assign us to work as ushers at certain concerts/events, which I imagine were being similarly under-funded. Midway through I think it was a sporting event/awards show or something, two guys walk out and then attempt to come back in. The first guy had his re-admittance wristband on, but I noticed the second guy did not so as they were walking back in I stopped the second guy and asked if he had his wristband. Sure enough, a split second after asking him I become aware that I'm staring right into the eyes of Samwise Gamgee. It took me a moment because unlike the rest of the celebrities there he was just wearing a t-shirt and shorts and looked like every other person on the casino floor.

They would be on Stubhub within minutes, prompting a lot of people to assume we were in cahoots with StubHub / ticket scalpers. Nothing they did was against the law.

We would have StubHub scalpers repeatedly cart the remaining few tickets on the day of a nearly sold out show. We would often get known ticket scalpers waiting at the front of a line for the box office onsale of a big show, and essentially be required to sell them what they wanted. Admittedly, we would quietly fuck with them in the only way in which we could: We would sell them tickets for about the fourth row behind what they asked for, and sell the better tickets to those whom we knew (to the best we could know), weren\u2019t ticket scalpers.

Howard Hunt\u2014has been described as a leading proponent of the theory that the CIA was responsible for the assassination of Kennedy.[11][12] Others who believe the CIA was involved include authors Anthony Summers and John M.

Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories, the \"Renegade CIA Clique\" theory, implicates Cabell and other alleged conspirators, including CIA officials James Jesus Angleton, William King Harvey, and Cabell's brother Charles Cabell.[4] This theory claims Earl Cabell re-routed Kennedy's motorcade as a favor to his brother.[4]The CIA document signed by Cabell seems to align with the above conspiracy theory about Cabell.
