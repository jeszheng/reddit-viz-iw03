So to the racists ( Edit: I'm sorry for this mistake, Muslims are obviously not a race, I'd like to thank /u/0signal0 to indicate this to me. I hope you understood what I meant, namely the anti-Muslims), we don't care if you pranked us in to eating pork. Quite contrary, we will pray to God to guide you to the right path to become a good person, ( not necessarily a Muslim ).B) We don't hate Jesus. In fact, we love him very much. To be honest, Jesus' role as a prophet will have a bigger impact on humanity in the future than Prophet Muhammed's actions ( pbuh ). C) We dislike ISIS/Boko Haram/Al Qaeda and other groups of low IQ morons as well, if not even more than you do. We really aren't dancing, partying, eating cake and singing victory songs when we hear of an \" Islamic \" terrorist attack  on television. D) We don't dislike non-muslims. Lakum deenukum wa liya din. You have your faith and we have ours. That's absolutely fine. E) This is something most people normally know, but I would still like to make it clear. Not all Muslims are Arabs ( Edit: and not all Arabs are Muslims. Credit to /u/30-xv for this ). You have Asian Muslims ( example: Indonesians ), you have European Muslims ( ex.: Albanians, Bosnians, Russians ), you have Indigenous North African Muslims ( Berbers ), You have Sub-Saharan African Muslims ( ex.: Somalians ), you have Persian Muslims ( Iranians ), etc. We are extremely diverse and we are not all the same!F) Allah is not a specific God for us alone. Allah means \" The God \" because we believe there is only one. It's the same God of the Christians and the Jews. G) Probably the most interesting for non-Muslims. Paradise is not only for \" us \". It's divided in 7 layers. The top layers are designed for the most pious Muslims and the lower ones for the less observant ones. An Atheist who dedicated his life to help poor and sick people or animals is more likely to be granted a place in heaven  than a \"Muslim\" who prays five times a day but smokes weed and doesn't respect his parents. It really isn't black and white. There is a huge gray area and you can get into paradise even for a single small deed.

I called my boyfriend to ask for his help to move some furniture around to make room for the hospital equipment coming to the house for my brother.He kind of sighed when I asked him and said \"Oh, I've had a loonnngg day at work and I'm realllyyyyy tired. Can't it just wait until tomorrow?\"\"Ummmm, no, it can't. The equipment is being delivered at 9am tomorrow. I need you now. This furniture is far too large for me to move on my own and my 75 year old mother really shouldn't be moving furniture.\"\"Well, I guess I'll come by and help\" and he hung up the phone.TWO HOURS LATER he comes over and moves the furniture, begrudgingly. We broke up not long after that. If he couldn't come through for me in that situation, he sure as hell wasn't going to come through in others. Buh-bye.Met my now husband about a year later. He moves furniture whenever I ask. :-)Edit - after reading responses below. My problem with the whole thing wasn't that he wasn't willing to drop what he was doing right that second to help. It was *totally* his attitude. I wouldn't have minded *at all* if he said, \"Hey Lena, I *just* got out of work. I'm going relax for a few, grab a bite to eat, get changed and then come over. I'll be there at 8pm.\" It seemed to be a bother to him that I needed help *at all* on a work night (and it wasn't like he was digging ditches all day - he worked in a cushy, air conditioned office) and it was particularly upsetting to me given the circumstances - my brother had had a serious, life-threatening accident the week before. Beyond that, we had lost my father to cancer the year prior, so my mom and I were truly on our own. I wasn't like I was calling my boyfriend every single day to help with an \"emergency.\"Among numerous other injuries, *both* my brother's legs were broken and he was going to be using a wheelchair for the next couple of months, so not only did we have to prep the house for the hospital equipment, we also had to make it as wheelchair accessible as we could in a very short time. It was truly an urgent, time sensitive situation and my boyfriend acted like it was an inconvenience *to him.* Yes, he did come over and move the furniture, but it was most definitely NOT with a smile and you could tell he was pretty annoyed and put out about the whole thing.The breakup wasn't due to just this one incident, but more that it was indicative of other, larger issues.

It\u2019s like she was his babysitter. My guess is he was always secretly in love with her. We had a class trip to Berlin. He wasn\u2019t allowed to go. We wanted him to come out drinking with us, and his mother said he was only allowed to drink at one place all night, and that she had to agree on where it was. She shot down everywhere, mostly because of experiences she had years ago when she was out round town. Bear in mind I worked in town at the time, had all the bars and bouncers by my side if needed.

He wasn\u2019t allowed to go to town alone unless one of us was with him. He isn\u2019t allowed WiFi at night, nor is he allowed chargers/plugs to be on at night.

Also if you need any idea of how disconnected he\u2019s become, his idea of picking up chicks (Virgin, don\u2019t recall him ever having an official girlfriend either) was to simply act like Barney from HIMYM. Not like, act like a confident version of yourself and just try for casual sex. I mean full on becoming Barney and quoting him and the show.

Everyone started kissing everyone for 'laughs' while high and getting extra light headed from smoking the hookah. Basically, we started off with people shotgun kissing each other, which led up to people trying to see how far we could 'pass the smoke on', in a group of over 20 people. People started getting so into the 'game', it went on for over an hour. Surprisingly nobody got offended when they had to shotgun the same gender and it soon turned into full-on making out; everyone was making out with everyone regardless of anything while simultaneously trying to be as sexy as possible, to the point where even guys were rubbing each other through their pants and girls were taking off their clothes. I'm pretty sure everyone got at least one satisfying kiss that night, and for some reason, I was a fan favorite, so I got heavily made out with by pretty much everyone in the room, sometimes by two people at once (I actually got to make out with a couple because one of them got jealous, so it was like a kissing threesome?). It was one of the most fucking bizarre situations I've ever been in, but I got kissed A LOT that night so I'm not complaining.In a way, it was kind of beautiful, a bunch of people coming together to get their kissing on. I would have shed a tear if not for the fact that I was too busy shedding my clothes because I ended up getting drunk(er) with one of the girls I had made out with during the kissing game and running around the apartment naked under a towel towards the end of the night, both of us trying to get one particular guy into bed.Threesome never happened, but again, I got a kissing/makeout/heavy petting orgy of almost 30 people that night that still makes me feel dirty TO THIS DAY.And I'd do it again, too.

Because that can start a premature detonation- \"nuclear fizzle\"- in the microsecond before optimum density is achieved.  Both these are so slow they're virtually non-radioactive.  Plutonium is especially toxic, however, chemically.  Uranium too.Thermonuclear \"hydrogen bomb\" weapons which use tritium (hydrogen isotope) *fusion* fuel have to deal with its 12 yr half-life.  In these designs, fusion is not actually a significant part of the energy- it's there to force a more through % of fission in the uranium/plutonium fuel, which increases the possible size of the explosion, also reduces the mass of uranium/plutonium fuel needed.  Now in many designs, lithium-6 deuteride is used to generate tritium during the detonation.  However, AFAIK some tritium is still needed to initiate this reaction.  All tritium is produced by lithium-6 bombardment in a special reactor, not related to nuclear power reactors.  It does not \"keep\" due to its 12 yr half-life and refrigeration does nothing to preserve it.Bottom line, thermonuclear hydrogen bombs DO need replacement of tritium every few years.Tritium is not integrated into the weapon AFAIK, whether it's part of the fuel or just an initiator, it's pumped in during the priming process from an external container.   All modern nuclear weapons are that thermonuclear \"h-bomb\" type and require tritium.Now the 12 yr half-life doesn't mean it's useless at 12 years.  It becomes diluted with new helium as the tritium decays.  Details on how enriched the tritium must be is very classified.  If the weapon still works at 12.5% tritium, that's 36 yrs after mfg.  If you had something in the storage container that adsorbed helium into a solid, the gas will always be 100% tritium, just losing more and more mass over the years.  In theory you could start with a large overkill of tritium in storage and still have enough left after a very long period to prime the weapon.Or, more likely, you'd have tritium (hydrogen) bonded into a solid/liquid such as iron hydride, as it decays the helium will always be an unbonded gas, which you could simply vent over time.  During priming you shut the vent, chemically force the iron hydride to release the tritium-hydrogen, and have high-purity tritium gas despite being after many half-lives.Outside of that, we worry about general decay of the tech.  Plastic explosives are used to compress the core have  a limited shelf life.  Electronics don't last forever even if unpowered.  A battery is essential to power the electronics.  A non-rechargeable lithium battery would last for like 10+ years, some dry-storage batteries that you have to mechanically mix the electrolyte into could in theory be dry-stored for hundred of years.Bottom line, if you're considering a fictional post-apocalyptic discovery of a long-abandoned nuclear weapon, it will probably not be usable due to loss of tritium.  Even the above \"iron hydride\" scheme would be a problem after 120 years=12x half-lives= 0.10% of the original tritium mass remains.

It has enough kinetic energy to get about half way up the valley way before it rolls back down towards the center. On the other side of the valley wall, the terrain slopes back down so that some distance away, it is at the same elevation as the center of the valley. Classically, that ball is destined to stay inside the valley for eternity. It doesn't have enough kinetic energy to get over the valley wall and down the other side. But if it was a quantum mechanical particle instead of a macroscopic ball, then as time goes on and the system evolves, the wave function expands beyond the valley wall and there becomes some probability that the particle will be found outside of the valley even though it's kinetic/potential energy never changed and never got large enough to get over the valley wall. It \"tunneled\" through the wall.This is how things like radioactive decay happen. An alpha particle being part of a nucleus is a low energy configuration because the residual strong force is attractive and stronger than the electric force at close distances so it holds it inside the nucleus. An alpha particle far from the nucleus is a low energy configuration as well because the strong force falls off and the electric force is repulsive keeping it away from the nucleus. The alpha particle being just far enough away from the nucleus to escape is a high energy configuration though. It's the valley wall separating the two low energy configurations.

In the spring of my second year, the head of the tutoring center I worked at basically smacked me upside the head and made me fill out the FAFSA.You see, California has something called the California College Promise Grant (formerly the Board of Governors Fee Waiver) which you can still be awarded even if you earn more than the official financial guidelines.I didn't have to pay my spring tuition and I was refunded for the fees I'd already paid the previous fall and winter terms, some $1300 or so in total.It's my understanding that almost no students who are over 25 or are considered financially independent from their parents have to actually pay their own tuition at California community colleges anyway.This bill will most likely benefit younger students 18-20 who are going to community college right out of high school or after taking a couple of years off. But, even so, someone taking the minimum full-time load of 12 units/semester, *yearly* tuition is $1104.And, while that is insanely inexpensive there *are* still those for whom it would be an unbearable burden, so this is great news!During my time there I, honestly, didn't understand what a gift I had been given. I was embarrassed to tell people I was in school or where. But, I had some truly amazing professors who, undeniably, changed my life.I transferred to UCLA after two years and I graduated this past spring with a double major in pure mathematics and statistics, and right now I'm a first year graduate student in statistics, planning on transitioning to the PhD program in a year.None of this would have been possible if it weren't for California's community college system. It changed my life and I will always support expanding that same opportunity to others. So, while this doesn't go as far as some might wish, it's a great step in the right direction.Sorry for the ramble, it's early and grad school is exhausting.tl;dr: I love California community colleges and everyone should move here and attend them.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2477, "stickied": false, "score": 963, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 14 18:32:57 2017", "ups": 963}, {"body": "Smart policy.

Those measures of success didn't reflect the actual success of the programs. If a student enrolls in an IT program, for example, and completes a year of classes before getting a job, the student is considered a failure. They have Microsoft and Cisco classes and labs that are surprisingly good for a community college. So if you're a help desk guy and want to improve your career, you can take a full CCNA and CCNP course in a pretty short period of time for a few hundred dollars, get a job as a network admin, and the system counts you as a failure.Anyway, the California community College system is an incredible opportunity for residents.

We usually have two other women with us, but they ran off to see a movie, so it was just me and three guys. They shall be named here as Dave, John, and Teddy. I'll be Jane.There's an entrance to a huge nature trail near Teddy's house, so we all meet there every time before we head out. We walk through one of many paths through the trail. Usually takes three to five hours depending on the path. When we reach the road on the other side, we set up for lunch and call an Uber to get us back to Teddy's. We met up at Teddy's at 7:00, ate breakfast, and hit the trail at 8:00. We were taking the longest path today. John is sort of the leader who buys all the supplies, decides where we're going and what we're doing, and carries the gun. Dave is the 'medic' who carries the first aid kit and knows how to use it. He also has this huge military-looking backpack in which he keeps the kit, a satphone, and a ton of other gear. Seriously, it's hilarious some of the random nonsense he pulls out of that thing. Teddy's the group mule. He's built like Terry Crews and he carries the tents / grill / food for days we plan on setting up out there.So we're hiking for hours, nothing is happening, then about twenty minutes from the end of the trail, it hits me. I didn't feel it coming at all, and it's like four days early. I immediately slink back like 20 feet from the group and start having a panic attack. I had NOTHING on me and I was wearing shorts. At least they were black, but they wouldn't hold much. I'd also 100% bleed up the Uber.Like five minutes later, after I'd decided on stuffing my bra down my shorts, Dave looks back and notices me walking like a goblin. To my horror, he falls back and starts walking next to me. He leans in and whispers,\"Do you need to pee?\"I'm like, huh? Then I realized I'm like doubled over with my hands on my crotch. Seemed obvious.\"No, I, that's not,\" I'm stammering.\"Period issue?\" he says next.At that point I'm [like this](https://i.imgur.com/gY2g9dP.png) and I just mumble \"yeah.\"And then, this guy, this fucking glorious, magnificent guy, he calls out to John and Teddy: \"Hey, Jane's scraped her arm on a tree or some shit, I'm gonna tend to it but it's gonna be like five minutes. Just get to the road and set up lunch and call the car.\"John says sure and the two of them keep on walking. Dave slides off his magical backpack and opens a pouch on the front of it. \"Pads or tampons?\" he says.I mutter \"tampons,\" completely stunned at all this. He pulls out three tampons, the good kind, and a handful of wet-naps. Hands them to me and then he opens the main compartment and pulls out a long sleeve black t-shirt. \"Go in the trees and take care of it, then tie the shirt around your waist.\" He then pulls out a big band-aid and slaps it on my arm to keep up his cover story.I ask him why he had these, he's just like, \"I've been hiking with women for years, you think I'm stupid?\"He turns and wanders like 50 feet away while I hobble into the woods. Come out a few minutes later all cleaned up and with the shirt covering my bum. He doesn't say another word about it as we get to the end of the trail. We eat while we wait for the car to show, get to Teddy's, and now I'm home.I think I love Dave now. Is it normal that I love Dave?It's true what they say, not all heroes wear capes.

Its 100% about these men knowing that they have huge power over young women trying to enter a very competitive industry and I think they do it just because they can.In my time I heard about other women and the gossip that they got jobs because they were happy to comply with these kinds of men its hard to know how true any of that is but it is true that a culture of sexual favours for jobs exists in the industry.At the time I was totally broken down by what I experianced in the industry and I had a kind of breakdown in my mid 20's. I feel bad I didn't speak out at the time but I felt so powerless as well as being young and stupid. I only told my Husband about what happened to me two days ago!With the truth about Harvey Weinstein coming out I really hope this disease in the film industry will be dealt with once and for all and that men will start to realise that they cannot treat women in this way.

I like a verbal warning right before anything touches my skin.May help to learn some imagery/breathing techniques.  Mindful breathing is helpful for me.If there are specific words or phrases or other things you're aware of that are particularly triggering because of the nature of your abuse, you can ask for those to be avoided.You can also \"practice\" or do the exam in parts - for example, one appointment just practicing lying down on the table with your clothes on, and stepping up to eventually doing the exam.Psychotherapy may also help, either by having someone to practically teach you some relaxation strategies etc. or, if you feel like it would be useful, to help you work through some of your history.

There are some things that help me get through it that I've discovered over the years.May be helpful to bring a supportive friend with you to hold your hand or just be there for moral support.  Can also bring some kind of comfort object like a rock or blanket or whatever you want.I usually wear a skirt or dress and I just take off my underwear and leave everything else on (including knee socks).  Feeling less undressed is way less freak out-producing for me.If the foot rests particularly get to you, there are other positions in which an exam can be done (knees bent and feet flat on the table is a good one for me - I like having something under my feet).  They can also tip up the top of the table a little bit if you don't like to be totally flat.You can tell them to either explain everything they're doing, or just say nothing and do it as fast as possible, depending on your preference.  I like a verbal warning right before anything touches my skin.May help to learn some imagery/breathing techniques.  Mindful breathing is helpful for me.If there are specific words or phrases or other things you're aware of that are particularly triggering because of the nature of your abuse, you can ask for those to be avoided.You can also \"practice\" or do the exam in parts - for example, one appointment just practicing lying down on the table with your clothes on, and stepping up to eventually doing the exam.Psychotherapy may also help, either by having someone to practically teach you some relaxation strategies etc. or, if you feel like it would be useful, to help you work through some of your history.  Not everybody with an abuse history wants or needs psychotherapy, but it can be really useful and healing if you find the right person :)This is also a great article: https://www.xojane.com/healthy/i-promise-you-can-get-a-pap-exam-even-if-you-are-traumatized-weirded-out-grossed-out-or-really-really-not-into-those-bits", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2379, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 14 17:25:55 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "I worked with client who had been sexually abused and was non verbal.

I just had to pick up a few things for breakfast tomorrow. As I was walking around the store, I get to a corner, and I feel someone\u2019s eyes on me. I look up to this guy just so he knows I am aware of his staring; now he\u2019s not just zoned out staring, he\u2019s purposely staring right at me. Right away I knew something was off.A little side note: I\u2019m generally a very observant person and was told throughout my raising \u201calways be aware of your surroundings.\u201d Because of this, I seem like a pretty paranoid person. I am always looking over my shoulder, around myself, how many people are around, and what would I do/where would I go if I was in a sticky situation. I enjoy my life just fine, but I\u2019m just very aware because I know terrible things can happen to anyone.After exchanging glances with this guy (I like to assume the best in each person so I give a slight smile because I do kinda have resting bitch face and people who don\u2019t know me, think I look unpleasant), I immediately walk around to get the rest of my groceries. I noticed his eyes were super bloodshot and he has this blank expression. He started following me down aisles, pretending to look at items near where I was. The last encounter I had with him was walking down an aisle away from the front while he\u2019s walking past towards the front; I looked up again, and he looks at me and mumbles, \u201cmmm, blue eyes.\u201d And this was sooo not okay to me. I am very paranoid, but it takes a lot to make me feel uncomfortable. And I was beyond uncomfortable. I was terrified. Who is this guy to say something so inappropriate and creepy to me? I called my mom to just have something to do while I waited for this guy to go through the checkout. I briefly explained the situation and told her I was going to have someone walk me out to my car. I walked to the end of a different aisle where I could see him, but not vise versa. I notice him looking around, looking for me. Even after he\u2019s checked out, this creepy dude looks for me again before finally leaving.I go to check out and explain to the cashier that I was being stalked while trying to shop. I asked for her to walk with me to my car and she, thankfully, did. Another woman behind me in line said, \u201chey, I noticed that guy. I assumed you guys were here together, but after he was following you around, I assumed otherwise. He looked at me too, and I gave him a dirty look.\u201d I walked to the car with the cashier, and I didn\u2019t see that disgusting stalking human again.I just wanted to share because it was my first time experiencing such (what for me was) a very traumatic event. I never expected this to happen. I\u2019m overly observant and paranoid about my surroundings, but I thought about others who weren\u2019t. What if I didn\u2019t catch onto this guys signals and stares? Would the woman behind me in the check out line would have said something to me before letting me walk out the door by myself? What if that man would have been waiting for me?It scared me so much and terrifies me to think what could have happened to other individuals out there who didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t think anything suspicious of it. It disgusts me that this human being thought they could stare and follow whoever they pleased. I wanted to share to remind everyone out there to be safe and aware of their surroundings. I know if it would have been someone else than me, I definitely would have said something. It\u2019s not okay and it\u2019s not your fault if you\u2019re being stalked. If you feel uneasy about a situation, it\u2019s 100% better to be safer than sorry. Sorry for the long post, everyone! Just a friendly reminder to be aware of yours and others surroundings!

I was hanging out with a male friend on a Friday morning. We had just gone for a walk on a local beach and were on our way to a coffee shop, when he had realized he had forgotten his wallet.Or so that was his claim.We went back to his house, where I had been many times before, and I followed him into his bedroom as we continued our chat about seabirds.Suddenly, he turned to me and threw me onto his bed.I thought little of it, as he could be \u201cplayful\u201d at times.Not this time.He started to peel my yoga pants down like he was opening a ripe banana. I was in shock. I started flailing, but he had my thighs pinned at this point.Next, he pulled my underwear down and inserted his fingers into my vagina.I tried to push him off of me - to give some context, he\u2019s 220lbs and I\u2019m 120lbs - but he had managed to maneuver himself atop of me and was in the process of taking out his penis.I was screaming at him to stop, still in shock that this was happening (to be honest, my memory is blurred for a lot of it which is a symptom of PTSD).At this point, all I remember is screaming \u201cNO / STOP / GET OFF OF ME / HELP\u201d and covering my vagina, where he was forcefully trying to insert himself inside of me.\u201cI need this. Please. I need this. Let me put it in, let me put it in, let me be inside of you.\u201dAfter what seemed like half an hour, he finally gave up trying to rape me, and proceeded to jerk off over me into a condom. When he finished, I just lay there, still as could be.I couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened, but more so I couldn\u2019t believe his reaction to it:\u201cDid you need a drive home? I can take you, I\u2019m headed your way anyway.\u201dUm. What?I left in silence. I went home, curled up in a ball, and cried for three hours. I felt disgusting. I felt nauseated. I felt like a whore. I started to blame myself for everything that had happened.He messaged me later that evening, pretending as if things were \u201cnormal\u201d. I ignored him for a few days, then finally responded. I told him how he had made me feel. I told him he had violated me physically and mentally. I told him he sexually assaulted me and, had I not stopped him, almost raped me.To this, he responded with mockery and disbelief.I told a few of my closest girlfriends, more for support than anything, and one called him out for it. He called me a liar and said I was being over-dramatic.And that\u2019s still his stance.I think about this situation at some point each and every day. It's incredibly soul-crushing.I have him blocked on all social media, phone numbers, etc. I've cut ties with most mutual friends, but there are some situations (like this weekend) where it's inevitable we'll cross paths.I'm dreading this wedding.

Every single one of my relationships has started out with a dude who has his shit together. Usually good job, career ahead of him, active, has lots of friends. All great guys. Then we start dating and it all goes to shit. These were all great guys. We have about a year of being all over each other, then in year two, I start to do my own things again. But they dont get back to their life. They kind of stagnate. They dont get back to the things that make them happy. They pull back from their friends, stop playing sports, get bored or fed up with career stuff. Generally they just all get to this point of depression. So because this has happened in FIVE of my relationships i'm pretty sure its got something to do with me. This sounds pretty terrible but they always tell me its not me. They all have said that they are happy with our relationship and that its got nothing to do with the relationship (on my end, I also believe this because we are generally still happy together). In ALL cases we were open and honest in communication, i'm a pretty chill girl so i dont care about a lot of things. Usually I just encourage them to be themselves and be honest with me. I encourage them to do whatever they want to do. If they want a new career, pursue whatever you want. If they want new friends, I understand. If they want to hang out with their old friends totally fine. Now because it has happened in ALL of my relationships. I think it has something to do with me. Now most of the time, I try to weather the storm and just support them through it. The past relationships I waited about 2 years (Im only 33 so two years is a long time in dating life). THEY NEVER RECOVER UNTIL AFTER WE BREAK UP. Most of them are now in happy relationships... I dont understandAnyway, I am dating my 5th guy. It took him two years... hes now depressed. I really like him and I think I want to marry him and for his sake I feel like I need to change something to save him. So about me... I am extremely independent. I have a bunch of stuff I am super passionate about, and a small friends group (which is all i need). I can get wrapped up in my shit so I dont leave the house for days.We have sex like once a week, so its not about sex. My girlfriends tell me just give him time to get out of it but. wtf. this happens in all of my relationships. I feel like its me. Does anyone have any advice or think they know what is going on?

The past year or so, I have been trying to make positive changes to my life, as I'm living with my SO and my depression was understandably getting on his nerves. I've started excercising, eating healthier, and studying more consistently (I'm last year on my bachelor's degree). I also work part time at a job I really enjoy, so I'm comfortable economically. In the beginning, I made sure not to be impatient, because I know things take time. However, its been a year ish, and somehow things have gotten worse. I started feeeling very tired all the time, and my immune system is probably failing because I always have a cold. I went to the doctor and did some tests and they told me to get vitamin supplements, which I have started taking but it isn't helping much. About a month ago I started noticing some red spots appear on my leg/stomach/breasts, and I have never had any problems with my skin, so I went back to the doctor. He gave me some cream, but he couldn't figure out what the spots actually were, and now i have three times as many (and the cream isn't helping so far). Lastly I also have had this issue with my SO about contraceptives, since he isn't a big fan of condoms. I stopped taking the pill a year ago since it was really bad on my depression, but I've started again since we're very much not wanting children.

I had my IUD placed a year ago. The sensation of insertion was like a very concentrated period cramp, uncomfortable but honestly not painful. I had no bleeding with insertion and had moderate cramps for about 3 days. I'll admit, the first few months of periods came with significantly heavier bleeding than I'd ever had before, along with some of the worst cramps I've had. Nothing was ever bad enough to keep me from going to work or school, though. After about 8 months of having it, I noticed I was taking less Ibuprofen for period cramps than in the previous months, and the heaviness started to ease up as well. It continued to lessen each month until now. This past cycle, I didn't take any ibuprofen at all, and the bleeding seemed to be about what it was before I had the IUD placed. Also at around 11 months, I had an ultrasound just to check the placement and my GYN said it looked perfect. I guess I should also mention that it's been an effective birth control method, if that wasn't obvious. I know that this probably isn't the typical Paragard experience, and that everyone has different bodies and therefore will have a different experience. I just wanted to share this because when I was doing my research on this device, it seemed that all I could find were horror stories of people experiencing bloodbaths or extremely intense paid. Even though those were the reviews I read on it, I still went through and couldn't be happier. I hope my experience can help to provide a new viewpoint for anyone thinking about getting a Paragard.

I remember it being the same even when I was a kid 8 or 9 years ago. For nearly the totality of the company's existence, the company sold us [herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring#/media/File:Herring_catch-Sep200.jpg), but now they sell us the detached heads or [Acadian redfish from Icelandic waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadian_redfish#/media/File:Sebastes_fasciatus.png). The problem is that seagulls love herring, its gummy and soft and the bones are thin and also soft, compared the the 90% bone skull of the Acadian redfish. The only thing the seagulls can eat out of these heads are the fish's eyes. This has, by definition, decimated the seagull population. Before there would be a crowd of over 30 seagulls. At the start of this summer, at least we would have 3 or 4. Now, in October, we are lucky to have 2. Also I just found out that Acadian redfish are endangered and are likely to go extinct. It is hard to believe we can be this wasteful. We are sending a species towards extinction and destroying the local population of another and can't even use the body of the Acadian redfish.

A longer read, but it will really help you understand how awful puppy mills are on a different level than just shouting hate/protest. Dear Martha,It\u2019s been fifteen months since you and I first met. More than likely, you remember very little about me. After all, we met in your world, on your property in fact. Since that day, elements of your world have become a very big part of mine. For that, myself and many like-minded people are very thankful to you.In February 2007, I received an email \u2013 \u201c50 Italian Greyhounds in need\u201d and with that, a phone number. Having had a lifetime affinity for the breed, I called the number to find out what the story was and how I might be able to help. I\u2019m certain you know where this letter is going now.Yes, February 17, 2007, after 40+ years, your kennel would be going out of business. Time to retire and relax after four decades of mistreating dogs. Five hundred and sixty one dogs would head to the auction blocks that day, 49 were Italian Greyhounds. It was without question that I would help, though I must admit, I had no idea what I would come to learn through the process. Due to transportation issues, I realized that if I were to be of any use to these dogs, I would have to drive out to Lamar myself. So, on the 16th of February, my daughter and I headed to Missouri.Understand, I\u2019ve been involved in dog rescue essentially my entire life \u2013 fostering and placing homeless dogs, caring for sick or injured dogs, assisting overpopulated shelters, etc. I have always known about puppy mills and pet store puppies but have never shared my home with anything other than rescued animals. For the record, I AM NOT AN ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST. What I am is a person who believes in the right to humane treatment for all living things.Martha, what I witnessed on your property was far from humane. Hundreds of terrified ailing faces, imprisoned in their wire confines, some staring at me, but most too fearful to look into my eyes, so unsure of how to interpret human contact. That experience has caused me countless sleepless nights and to this very day, the sadness and the fear in their eyes haunts my very being.I am completely aware that you were operating well within USDA standards \u2013 what a despicable thought that is. I am also aware that in your circles, commercial breeding dogs are considered livestock. Dogs are not livestock, Martha. Thousands of years ago, man domesticated dogs to be our protectors, hunters, herders, guardians, but most of all, our companions.I came home with thirteen of your dogs \u2013 nine Italian Greyhounds, two Dachshunds and two Papillons. Not a single dog that I had cared for in over 25 years of rescue work came anywhere close to the physical and emotional damage that your dogs had suffered. As it related to rescuing dogs, the next several months would become the education of a lifetime for me.The entire purpose of this letter though, is about just one of those dogs, the one who would find her forever home here with my family\u2026.. #251 \u2013 AKC registered \u201cReedgate\u2019s Swift Motion\u201d. Oh, the irony of her name \u2013 Swift Motion \u2013 an Italian Greyhound who was never able to run. Caging her for her entire life stripped her of ever having enough strength in her legs to experience the joy of running. A cruel reality for a breed built to run.In our home, we cut the chain from her neck, replaced it with a soft collar and named her Lily. At the age of seven years and one month Lily had been set free.Lily was one of several of your dogs that was missing her lower jaw. I wonder how you might explain why so many of your dogs were suffering from this condition. I wonder if you were ever concerned about their pain or perhaps about how they were able to eat enough to stay alive. I wonder how many died in your care from the results of this condition. I wonder if you even noticed. I\u2019m very certain you did notice one thing beyond the rotting faces though \u2013 their ability to produce puppies. That\u2019s what your business is all about \u2013 producing puppies, at any expense.Lily became an absolute treasure in our home. Despite her many health issues and her extreme fear, in time, with lots of love and care, she found her courage and when she did, no one was immune to her love. Men, women and children brought to tears to hear her story and to have the untold pleasure of meeting her. Lily\u2019s life was no longer about what she could do for you but instead, how we could make it up to her in a warm and loving home.It was agonizing for our family to watch her suffer through four surgeries to remove mammary tumors, to attempt to repair her decaying face and to spay her \u2014 removing the papery black, pus filled organ that was once her uterus. How selfish of you never to see her pain, just the dollars.Directly because of your gross neglect, every meal Lily ate was a struggle. We tried so many foods and so many different ways to make it easier for her to eat. But in the end, she had to do it her way, the way she learned at your place, the way she kept herself alive for you \u2013 picking kibbles out of her bowl, a few at a time with her feet, spreading them around the floor, then rubbing the \u201cgood\u201d side of her face along the floor to catch a kibble on her tongue, then extending her neck upwards and swallowing it whole. Think about that, Martha. How would you like to eat just one meal that way?Do you remember sitting in my car when the auction was over? The guys were gathering up the dogs that I had \u201cwon\u201d. You said to me, \u201cI just love my Italian Greyhounds\u201d. Oh, the thoughts that went through my mind when those words came out of your mouth. You don\u2019t love any dogs, Martha. What you did was spend more than forty years of your God given life using dogs for your personal gain. No regard to their physical or mental well-being, just cashing in on their ability to reproduce. Think about the thousands of dogs that passed through your hands \u2013 you robbed every single one of them of the simple joys they so deserve. A good meal, a warm and comfortable place to sleep, medical attention, and most of all, a human companion to make their lives whole.Lily learned so much in our home \u2013 about being a family member, being a dog, being worthy. I will always be bothered that she never learned how to run or really how to play. But she learned how to love and be loved and for that, there are no words. She changed our lives forever.Lily died on May 13, 2008 at the age of eight \u2013 about half the life expectancy for an Italian Greyhound. Martha, she died as a direct result of the neglect she suffered for seven years in your care. How many others have suffered the same fate?This industry has been hidden far too long. The word is out, the days are numbered. People like you will soon venture out into fields of honest work and leave the care of God\u2019s creatures to those of us who truly love them.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1229, "stickied": false, "score": 256, "submission_time": "Sat Oct 14 09:09:35 2017", "ups": 256}, {"body": "That's good, but how do you legally define a \"puppy mill\" over a regular dog breeder?
