There was a big division in our church regarding the 2016 election. You would think all Catholics would vote for the pro life candidate.....but many people believed that trump wasn't a true social conservative anyway, having flip flopped on those kind of issues throughout his life. Anyway not all Catholics are one issue voters like me. A lot of them really think it's more important to help the immigrants and the poor and also to protect the planet and stop wars and stuff like that. Things democrats traditionally support. In my parish, many are descendants of Irish immigrants who consider themselves proud \"lifelong democrats\". But it's also a wealthy beach community and people want to lower their taxes, etc. Which would usually favor the republican candidate. So as a result most of us avoided discussing politics! Add to that, the fact that most priests I know also have varying political opinions. And for the most part, the priests themselves wouldn't want to drive away half of the congregation by supporting one candidate or the other. Pope Francis came close when he (sort of)criticized Trump ( in not so many words) for the border wall. I was actually surprised at the reaction. Sean Hannity (who as everyone on r/politics knows, is one of my favorite people. Really ! Not being sarcastic). Actually said on his radio show that the pope had no business commenting on such things and he disagreed...rather strongly I thought....with the Popes actions. But Sean himself is a Catholic who actually went to a theology school at one point (if you look up his wiki bio. He never talks about it. ). So you see there's a public example of what would happen in our churches. I think it's fine for church leaders to talk about social issues in general, from the pulpit. I was actually really glad when our pastor preached against abortion a couple weeks back. As I said, I'm a one issue voter who of course voted for Trump only because of Hillary's radical pro abortion rhetoric. But I can understand the other pressing issues of our day that we as Christians should be concerned about. And when someone preaches on those issues, I'm also glad those were addressed. (Such as helping immigrants). I think we are all keenly aware that there *Is No* ideal candidate.....but who among us is ideal? (Except Marco Rubio ). :) Now maybe if there were a candidate who espoused ALL the tenets of a particular faith...then maybe....but no political party would back such a person since they would take political positions from both sides of the aisle. Or, because they weren't \"secular \" enough....being approved by a religious group would have people accusing the candidate of being a religious zealot trying to impose a theocracy. Like they did to mike huckabee perhaps? (Or even....Marco Rubio?):)TL;DR as a practicing Catholic I think it's a bad idea for a church to directly endorse a candidate.

Most of Mueller's team have experience in prosecuting RICO trials, including guys like Weissman and Goldstein.    The biggest name I noticed back in the Summer when these guys were brought on board was Greg Andres. Greg Andres was another former DOJ prosecutor, having worked in white collar crimes (As do most of Mueller's team) and fraud.

In addition to the civil money penalty, the casino is required to conduct periodic external audits to examine its anti-money laundering (AML) BSA compliance program and provide those audit reports to FinCEN and the casino\u2019s Board of Directors.>Trump Taj Mahal, a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, admitted to several willful BSA violations, including violations of AML program requirements, reporting obligations, and recordkeeping requirements. Trump Taj Mahal has a long history of prior, repeated BSA violations cited by examiners dating back to 2003. Additionally, in 1998, FinCEN assessed a $477,700 civil money penalty against Trump Taj Mahal for currency transaction reporting violations.>\"Trump Taj Mahal received many warnings about its deficiencies,\" said FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery. \"Like all casinos in this country, Trump Taj Mahal has a duty to help protect our financial system from being exploited by criminals, terrorists, and other bad actors. Far from meeting these expectations, poor compliance practices, over many years, left the casino and our financial system unacceptably exposed.\">Trump Taj Mahal admitted that it failed to implement and maintain an effective AML program; failed to report suspicious transactions; failed to properly file required currency transaction reports; and failed to keep appropriate records as required by the BSA. Notably, Trump Taj Mahal had ample notice of these deficiencies as many of the violations from 2012 and 2010 were discovered in previous examinations.    I really wouldn't be shocked one bit of Mueller folds a bunch of separate charges into RICO predicates for those involved. I'm still a bit unsure about the President's actual role in all this, as it's become apparent that he is a figurehead and fucking moron to everyone he's dealt with. But I wouldn't be shocked if people like Manafort, Don Jr., Jared Kushner, Flynn, Stone, etc. got popped for RICO violations. It's starting to come together that they almost all acted together as a conspiracy or racket, thus opening the door for RICO to be used. Money laundering, tax evasion, mail/wire fraud, bribery, etc. These are all hallmarks of a major Mafia trial. And given the reports that no respectable bank or lender loaned/did business with Trump after his string of utter failures of bankruptcies, it's not crazy to deduce Trump likely reached out to non-legitimate sources for his real estate projects in New York.

Brazille is a part of the problem.  Remember when she was caught [sending](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/donna-brazile-finally-admits-she-shared-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign/article/2617742) primary debate questions to Hillary?  Yeah, she was a part of the corription between the DNC and Hillary.  Shes tried so hard in that piece to paint herself as the hero savior.  But she is the pond scum she writes about.I hope the DNC under Perez does a better job investigating and making sure this injustice never happens again.

Unfortunately coronary artery disease is a highly complex process. The majority of heart attacks are not actually due to the narrowing of arteries, but rather the rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque which then gets lodged further downstream into a narrower part of an artery or arteriole. This effectively cuts off blood supply to that area acutely and so the cardiac muscle can't compensate. It's why everyone has heard from someone that their friend/family member \"had completely clean arteries\" on cardiac catheterization imaging after a heart attack / myocardial infarction (MI):Atherosclerosis development is a very slow process. More recent literature suggests that due to its slow nature the heart has time to grow collateral vessels (off-shoots from branches that have good blood supply) that feed portions of the heart that are having their blood flow limited by atherosclerosis, and that there might be a cardioprotective effect to this in patients.  Basically now you have 2 or more small blood supplies to one area instead of 1  good one. So,  if you lose one of those supplies due to a ruptured plaque, you still have another small one that may or may not save your heart tissue, decrease the area of tissue death, or at least buy you more time until appropriate intervention.  Cardiac muscle  that slowly loses blood flow and oxygen delivery due to atherosclerosis also changes its metabolism and decreases its oxygen consumption. This tissue doesn't work as well as normally perfused heart tissue, resulting in other issues, but again it may give this lower energy tissue more time to receive intervention than  tissue  that's working full throttle on an empty tank of gas.That's not to say that atherosclerosis is benign, and not all patients compensate well. The decrease in blood flow through a stenosed artery can lead to problems of demand ischemia. Basically, if a muscle has to work harder, it needs more oxygen that it just can't get through a hose now half its original diameter, but they are okay at baseline. It can cause debilitating chest pain with exertion (stable angina) if it affects the coronary arteries, and if affecting the arteries of your arms and legs can lead to pain with walking or muscle use (peripheral arterial disease). It's extremely painful, and if it gets bad enough will lead to death and necrosis of distal tissue as not enough oxygen is reaching further parts of the limb to meet their basic metabolic demands. This leads to ulcerations that often become infected and lead to a whole host of other problems. However, unstable plaques in distal arteries can also rupture resulting in a peripheral arterial embolism that clogs a downstream artery and will cause a finger/toe/limb to acutely lose blood supply. This is a surgical emergency that requires revascularization by breaking up the dislodged clot with drugs or possibly surgery. Sometimes intervening to remove plaques will actually rupture one, resulting in a treatment induced analogue to the aforementioned process (ex. blue toe syndrome).My fear in a drug like this would be that it actually weakens already formed plaques, making them more likely to dislodge and cause an MI or acute life/limb threatening event. Maybe it would serve a purpose in preventing plaque formation, but might be dangerous in a population that already has atherosclerotic disease... which is the population they intend to study. In science we can theorize all we want, and talk ourselves in both directions. What we need is data and empiric proof. Like most of the articles on futurology,  this  is still in very early stage animal models. I'm not holding my breath.

When it became sexual, he was really 'nice' about it, not forcing me to do things to him, but asking & begging. I felt like I had something he wanted, that I had a certain kind of power over him. He never told me he loved me, but said that's what loving brother do for eachother.  So I 'willingly' gave him blowjobs and jacked him off multiple times, because I wanted him to continue being nice to me.  I don't know what he told our parents, but somehow I ended up sharing a room with him. He had the top bunk and I had the bottom bunk. He'd jump off the top bunk and stand there while I sat on the edge of my bed and did things to him. He never crawled into bed with me. I remember wanting him to be in bed with me. I wanted him to lay next to me. I remember exactly what my desires were; full body contact, nothing else. I craved it. He never did that, or reciprocated.  I was very alone and untouched in this thing he created.  I also couldn't see his face when I did these things. I would close my eyes and imagine what his face looked like. I wanted to see the pleasure on it. I wanted him to look at me. It was very cold & impersonal. All I could see was from his feet  to his upper chest.  But at that time, it was worth it, because he never beat me up after that. He even protected me from his younger brother who was 3 years older than me.  I just never realized I was still being abused. He created a situation he knew I would view as 'better & safe'.  All these years later, I still have a dream every now and then of him laying in bed with me, both of us fully naked, and he's running his fingers over my skin and looking me in the eyes. *spelling", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 17034, "comment_id": "dp9a0y3", "score": 8, "submission_time": "Thu Nov  2 21:45:02 2017", "ups": 8}, {"body": "That is such a sad interview.
