I'm basing my opinion on what happened before the [Nixon impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_process_against_Richard_Nixon#Pre-Watergate_impeachment_efforts). tl;dr, a handful of articles were introduced, but nothing actually voted on. The one time articles were introduced and nearly voted on, people became worried about the future likelihood of impeachment.

This basically forces \"sides\" and forces some members of Congress to make a decision NOW. Here's why that's a problem:1.) It's a well known psychological effect that if you are shown information that is contradictory to your current beliefs, you will try to ignore or discount it. By forcing Republicans (some of whom may secretly be on the fence but not ready to publicly support) to decide on impeachment right now, they're less likely to accept additional information in the future that would otherwise warrant support for impeachment hearings.2.) Layering it on, forcing Republicans to make a *public* stand or statement on impeachment even further cements their resolve. This is why motivational coaches always tell people to publicly announce their intention to diet/work out/whatever because they will feel an implied social pressure to follow through. Turning NO votes YES and vice-versa is very difficult because they become public contradictions.3.)

Some of it will end up being incorrect. However I believe like Steele does that most of it is true.

James Clapper, director of national intelligence, later confirmed the \u201csensitive\u201d stream of intelligence from Europe.

Honestly, I have looked into this \"extra judicial killing\" situation a little more as my gf is filipina and if you actually examine the numbers, you will see there is a huge exaggeration of the facts being exported to western countries.  While it is true that there are more people being killed in police raids overall from the past administrations, there has also been an increase in police raids as part of the crackdown on drugs that he has initiated.  You can have a concern  about the policy itself, but the numbers show that the ratio of criminals killed during raids are similar to before.  This means the increase in overall deaths can be attributed to the increase in police activity rather than a system of state sanctioned executions.  Also, the number of reported extra judicial killings has been reported as high as 7,000 or more, whereas from police records during Duterte's administration there have been only 9,432 total homicides reported with 2,692 resulting from police operations.  This means 6,740 represent all other homicides (crimes of passion, disputes, drug activity, etc).  In addition, since I already explained that the ratio of criminals being killed during raids has remained similar as in past administrations, there cannot have been a significant change in the way these raids are being conducted (ie. reports of summary executions).  Also, it is important to note the degree of support he has within the Phillipines as he is somewhere around 80% approval rating.  His policies have also enjoyed wide support despite the growing condemnation from the international community, as average filipinos feel that he is making the country safer.  In the US, we have so many mass shootings, our rate of incarceration is by far the highest of western countries, and we also have a significant drug omabuse problem.

Jackie Speier (Calif.) said on Tuesday that around $15 million in settlements has been paid out by the House of Representatives on behalf of those who have been accused of sexual harassment in the past 10 to 15 years.MSNBC host Chuck Todd asked about the taxpayer money that has been used to cover up sexual harassment allegations against members of Congress.> \"If the taxpayer is involved, don\u2019t we have the right to know?\" Todd asked the congresswoman.> \"Well, I think you do have the right to know, but right now, under the system, you don\u2019t have the right to know,\" Speier said.WTF?

You will be stunned.* Right now it takes about 90 days for someone to file a complaint against a congressional rep.

The tendency of US culture is to \"Squeeze every penny\" from the end user. And as of the last twenty years, we've entered full-on tyrant mode. Single player games and other software today will not even install and run without connecting to the Internet first. In some cases, the publishers have even taken away content or features after the user buys the product.\"Tyrant mode\" enables the establishment to further chip away at your rights to for example buy, trade, and sell content second hand that you bought. This means that the only way to get a legitimate copy of a product is to buy it from the publisher, and so they will charge \"whatever they fucking feel like\" for it, because there is no competition from second hand sales anymore. They will also monitor anything and everything that you do with the product and sell it to both advertising networks and the government.As for how to fix things? I don't know. All I know, is how to slow the progression down. I don't buy games or other proprietary software anymore. Supporting tyrants only leads to more tyranny. And this trend does not only affect the software world. When HDTV was standardized, the entertainment industry tried to push for a broadcast flag mandate. What is that? Any device which supports recording was going to be mandated to check the incoming broadcast for said flag, and if the station chose to embed the flag, the recorder would refuse to record the show.

On top of that, you can't just give everyone equal service while charging them different amounts, at least not easily.Using a future Microsoft Windows 14 as an example:  - There's a base version that everyone can get for $0 (because they can't afford it for more and would steal it if it wasn't free).  - But, MS knows there are people who can pay too, so they charge $10 for a version that lets you use 2 monitors and some other nice but minor features.  - MS also knows there are people who can pay *more*, so they release a version for $50 that allows people to use any number of monitors and all the RAM they can fit in their computer.  - But then there are corporate clients and they just want everything and don't really pay attention to price, so MS adds a version with bonus features that are useful to corporations.  99% of home users don't care about these features btw, so paying for this version is overkill for them.  Then MS charges $150 for this corporate edition.  Everyone buys the best version they can reasonably afford and, generally, the features you can afford to use are all included in the version you bought.  This hypothetical example is variable pricing done well.  The people who can't afford to pay for windows aren't going to have an awesome computer with 5 monitors, so they aren't really losing much, if anything.  This is great for Microsoft because they are getting as much money as they can from every level of their potential user base.  The examples you're mentioning tend to be worse examples of the same thing.  Where not being able to pay for the more expensive versions actually prevents you from using features that you're reasonably likely to use.  Free-to-play with micro-transactions is especially big because the price point starts at $0 and goes up as high as people are willing to pay.edit: missed the questions at the end.> Why are things changing now?

A big part of the answer here is that rising income inequality has put extreme amounts of money into the hands of a select few, which they without fail use to invest in the stock market. This means that it's now more likely than ever that a single investor or small group of investors can gain a controlling stake in any given company, which they can then use to exert significant control over the direction that company takes by hiring or firing its top executives.

But they never quite deliver.](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2017/11/14/on-human-rights-and-climate-change-justin-trudeaus-actions-dont-match-his-talk-walkom.html)The prime minister did not, for instance, warn Duterte and Suu Kyi that they could be subject to Canadian sanctions unless they mended their ways.In fact, Trudeau said, he pointed out that no one is perfect and that Canadian governments, too, have done bad things in the past.Which, while historically accurate, doesn\u2019t help either Duterte\u2019s victims or the Rohingya.While all of this was going on in Asia, McKenna was in Germany promoting a scheme to phase out coal-fired electricity generation globally in order to reduce carbon emissions.She pointed out that Canada has already made a start on this \u2014 which indeed it has.The former Conservative government of Stephen Harper came up with a plan to phase out most coal-fired generation. The Trudeau government accelerated it. Ontario has closed its coal-fired plants and Alberta has promised to do the same.But Canada is not phasing out coal.First, the federal government plans to exempt coal-fired generating plants that are able to reduce their emissions significantly through new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage. This is perilously close to the notion of clean coal that Trump is mocked for discussing.Second, Canada continues to mine and export coal for other countries to burn. In 2015, it exported more than 30 million tonnes, mainly to Asian steelmaking plants.All of which is to say that McKenna\u2019s crusade against coal, while welcome, isn\u2019t exactly as advertised.But then little in the climate-change struggle is. The UN has reported that the carbon reduction targets secured under the much-ballyhooed 2015 Paris Accord are grossly inadequate and that much more must be accomplished if the world is to keep global temperature increases within safe bounds.More to the point, most countries \u2014 including Canada \u2014 do not have mechanisms in place that will allow them to reach these targets. Ottawa\u2019s proposed $50 per tonne carbon tax, for instance, is nowhere near high enough to do the job. Some experts say it would have to reach $200 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions to be effective.For the Trudeau Liberals, climate change and human rights are defining political principles.

No outsider could ever understand the corruption that targets politics in the Philippines. Every politician could be bought by money, and the votes of the people within the regions were also bought by money. The politicians, generals, and police could also be bought by the drug lords who run the show. The media you see that is highly shown on international television is also bought and paid for by whoever pays the highest price. The rallies you see where the \"people\" are rallying against Duterte? All paid for. They are the poorest in the country, give them a few pesos and they will do whatever they are paid to do.ALL the money raised internationally for Yolanda? Gone. The victims of Yolanda received the breadcrumbs of that.If you were a tourist back in the day, good luck getting in/out without going through bullsh*t. They could put bullets in your suitcase and when you scanned through, you would be extorted for money.Customs agents took bribes for shipments. Police would turn a blind eye to crime. Imagine you walking home, being assaulted, and you cannot report it because the gang that assaulted you is paid by the police. Go to the media to tell them the police are corrupt? They are paid by the same gang. Go to the politicians to ask for change? They are paid off too. So you are screwed left, right, and sideways.Duterte, while extremely harsh in his methods, is the best solution the Philippines has at the moment. The Philippines needs leadership that will take out corruption. Duterte cannot be bought. The Philippines needs progress, Duterte wants that. He has gone on the record to say he is aware his life is in danger because of his drastic methods. There are many who stand to lose because Duterte does not give two flying sh*ts who gets screwed over. As long as the bad guys are gone, that's what matters. The matter of \"how\" is what seems to have the Western world up in arms.My mom also knows that his use of language may seem vulgar, but that's the way he talks. The translation into international media does not go over well. My mother's brother is a local politician within the Philippines. He was a vice-mayor within the local town, he then was a councilor. At the last election, he lost because he could not BUY votes. Again, BUY votes.

These are often drip-fed at best to the players with the incentive to buy more, and several big name studios/publishers are utilising a classic mobile app technique of introducing a premium currency. Players buy this currency with real world cash, and then use that to buy the loot boxes in which they receive random stuff.The important thing to bear in mind with premium currencies is that they distance the consumer from the money they're spending, and this is an effective technique that dominates the mobile games market. The difference here, though, is that this is becoming a feature in games that people have already purchased for $60.**Variations of loot boxes:** Most gamers will often get nit-picky about games that do loot boxes. Microtransactions (in-game payments) in games are often quite common these days, but there are variations. One of the most praised systems at the moment is in Titanfall 2, where one can purchase specifically what they want, with no premium currency. The key thing with Titanfall 2 is that every microtransaction is cosmetic, meaning that absolutely none of them affect gameplay for you or another person in any way. People like this, but to keep things clear, this is *not* a loot box, as there is transparency and the knowledge that you're getting what you want.Loot boxes sometimes have the same kind of content. For example, the Destiny games, while having their premium currency \"Silver\", only offer cosmetic items, and are totally optional purchases. Many other games do this, with some variation in how they're incorporated. I often see gamers on both sides of the argument when it comes to this kind.However, not all games' loot boxes are like this. EA's Star Wars: Battlefront 2 does loot boxes very differently, and they're not the first to do so in the way that I'll explain next.**The important part - Battlefront 2's loot box controversy:** Now we come to the loot boxes that caused such a storm over EA and this new Battlefront - **gameplay-affecting loot boxes.** These are the things that gamers get very vocal about, myself included. What this entails is a player being able to purchase these loot boxes (with or without a premium currency involved) and receive gameplay-affecting items. This includes, but is not limited to, weapons, equipment, and modifiers to character abilities, health, aim assistance, and damage/duration of attacks.Why is this a problem? It's a problem because it instantly skews the playing field to no longer be even. A player who drops $200 on these loot boxes will have a chance of obtaining items in-game at a much faster rate, or even acquiring better stuff all-together, compared to a player who hasn't spent a penny on loot boxes. This effectively turns the game into a pay-to-win or pay-to-progress environment.These loot box features in Battlefront 2 are dominating the progression system in the game. Coupled with a distinctly slow progression through traditional means, EA have been shamelessly marketing the loot boxes with intent to squeeze extra money out of consumers.Battlefront 2 is by far not the first to incorporate these business practices, but it is certainly one of, if not *the* most aggressive games currently doing this.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 34146, "comment_id": "dpvu1w1", "score": 43, "submission_time": "Thu Nov 16 03:12:19 2017", "ups": 43}, {"body": "This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.pcgamesn.com/star-wars-battlefront-2/battlefront-2-loot-box-gambling-belgium-gaming-commission) reduced by 52%.

It was a relatively small earthquake, but likely fairly shallow and close to Pohang where the most intense shaking has been reported so far.Edit: A few Q&As\u2026* **Will it cause a tsunami?** This earthquake was near the coast but not offshore or underwater. With no water above the fault to displace, the earthquake will not produce a tsunami.* **Was it natural or a nuclear test?** Seismologists can distinguish between a test and an earthquake from the waves that are generated and recorded at seismic stations. They look [very different](https://ds.iris.edu/media/specialevent/2013/02/12/north-korea-nuclear-explosion/NK_NV_1.png). The main difference is that an explosive test will have large amplitude pressure waves but little to no shear waves, whereas the shearing motion of an earthquake on a fault will produce larger amplitude shear waves than pressure waves.* **Okay, it was natural, but was it triggered by a nuclear test?** Probably not. The two mechanisms we know of for triggering earthquakes is through static stress triggering and dynamic stress triggering. Static stress would require the triggered earthquake to be within about a fault length (>5km) of the triggering test. Dynamic stress triggering would require the triggered earthquake to occur as the waves of the triggering test were passing by and stressing the fault, mere minutes to hours after the test. More about triggering in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/52ex23/south_korea_just_got_hit_with_a_54_magnitude/d7k3h9m/?context=3).* **Then what was it caused by?** While South Korea does not have a major plate boundary running through it, there are [active faults](https://www.intechopen.com/source/html/45498/media/image3.jpeg) in the area as seen in this cross-section interpretation  [[Egawa, Intech, 2013](http://www.intechopen.com/books/mechanism-of-sedimentary-basin-formation-multidisciplinary-approach-on-active-plate-margins/east-asia-wide-flat-slab-subduction-and-jurassic-synorogenic-basin-evolution-in-west-korea)].

It does not, even when the birth is not itself the result of a felony sexual assault.While it is true that there is no \"anchor baby\" clause in any of our laws, it is a fact that some folks can apply for \"Cancellation of Removal\" when in deportation proceedings. This includes having U.S. children, but is not enough by itself to stave off deportation. Cancellation of removal has the following elements:(A) Physical presence in the United States for a continuous period of 10 years; (B) Good moral character during that period of time; (C) No convictions for certain criminal offenses; and (D) **Exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to** the applicant\u2019s spouse, parent, or **child who is a citizen of the United States** or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. So the news article is correct in some way: having an \"anchor baby\" will not save you from deportation, however, if you have those other things mentioned above in addition to having a baby, AND you can show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the U.S. citizen child, then yes, you can apply for cancellation of removal.
