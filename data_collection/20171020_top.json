He has a lovely wife and works very hard as a dog catcher, which is an elected position in his town due to a very antiquated law. He runs unopposed every two years because he is the best at his job. He catches stray animals without every having to hurt them, earning him a lot of respect.After six years on the job as dog catcher, the mayor in Juan's city resigns after a massive sex scandal. People are disgusted, as it is a very closely knit community and they can't believe the number of affairs the mayor was carrying on, nor the fact he was apparently drunk and abusive towards his wife.The opposition party immediately realizes they have a great opportunity in the upcoming election to have a mayor they agree with. They go to Juan and offer him the nomination.Juan is hesitant at first. \"I've only ever been a dog catcher, what makes you think I'll be a good mayor.\"The party leader is insistent \"I know you to be a hard worker, someone who does everything he has to do to the best of his ability. I want you as our candidate.\"Juan runs and creates a great slogan: I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't beat my wife. He has no primary challengers and wins the general election in a landslide.Juan finds out the previous mayor was incompetent and that lead to a ton of wasteful spending. Juan does a major overhaul on the city's finances and manages to even cut taxes. He is re-elected in an uncontested race.The Governor of New York announces he is not running for another term. Juan's town urges him to run for governor. He is hesitant to do it at first, but the voters beg him to do it and he decides to run. Same slogan. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't beat my wife.He beats his challenger easily again and he becomes Governor of New York. He is able to work across the aisle because everyone likes him and he is re-elected twice with soaring approval rates.In the middle of Juan's third term as governor, the President of the United States is term limited. All eyes are on America's favorite governor, Juan. He is hesitant to do it yet again. President is a huge responsibility, but his party pressures him to at least try. He uses the same slogan again: I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't beat my wife.He crushes his opposition in the primary and wins an electoral college and popular vote landslide. Juan is elected President and his inauguration breaks viewership records (he is the first Hispanic president after all). He immediately pushes through popular legislation and begins writing up genuine free trade agreements, meant to help the little man and not just big corporations.In the first year of his presidency there is a new President of Cuba, a young guy willing to end tensions with America. Juan works with him to write up a trade agreement.As they are to sign the agreement, the President of Cuba offers Juan a cigar. Juan is hesitant, he always told America that he didn't smoke. But the Cuban President is insistent. Juan smokes a cigar.Juan tells his wife that he broke part of his pledge to America. She comforts him saying that once in a while, everyone makes a mistake. He still never drinks and has never hurt her. Juan is inspired and goes back to work as hard as ever.In the second year of his term, Juan makes another trade deal, this time with France. France has just left the EU and is looking for a closer relationship with the USA.As he signs the treaty with the French President, she offers him some wine. At first he is hesitant, but she begins pouring the glass and he decides to drink it.He returns to his wife and she is mad that he broke his platform again and that he was drinking with another woman. Juan can't handle the pressure and he snaps, slapping his wife across the face.\"Oh my god.\" he says \"I just broke my entire platform.\"So he walks out of the Presidential bedroom, down some stairs, past a bunch of offices, down some more stairs, enters the Oval Office, opens up his desk where he finds a golf gun.

He then slowly slides the $50 check across the bar to the horse. The horse picks up the check with his hooves, passively looks at it, pulls out his credit card, slowly slides it and the check back, and then calmly goes back to watching the game as he laps his beer. Now the bartender is still confused, the situation is difficult to get his head around, but he doesn't want to risk offending a 1000lb horse by asking the wrong questions.

When smoking weed didn't destroy me, I did a lot of research in college, and spent the next several years trying every drug I could get my hands on.  Here is my learned opinion:1. Weed is pretty safe, but if you smoke it everyday, you will lose your initiative and ability to think long-term.  Use in moderation, to accentuate a good time.  Don't let weed BE the good time.2. LSD is amazing stuff, makes you see and think about things in a way that would've been impossible without it.  Also makes my teeth feel funny.  Do in a safe place, and have something very sugary around to help speed things up if you aren't enjoying the sensation.3. Mushrooms.  Same as above, bit more complex and organic feeling.  Also, you'll crap out a big ol' hot toxic turd once all is said and done.4. Cocaine.  Imagine the best day of your life, when you were just the big winner from start to finish.  That's the rush/feeling of cocaine, which doesn't last long, and leaves you feeling empty and desirous of more cocaine.  Stay the hell away from the stuff if you have even the slightest addictive personality, it will wreck your life faster than you thought possible.  Luckily, that's with good coke.  With bad/watered down coke, meh, didn't do much other than make my throat and nasal cavity raw.5. Heroin.  That warm, wonderful feeling you have when you just wake up after having a great sleep, that's about how I'd describe heroin.  When you aren't on heroine, everything around you is fingernails on a chalkboard.  Stay the fuck away from that stuff at all costs.6. MDMA makes you a highly efficient and fun party animal.  Sort of like being really horny, but minus the need to rub parts of yourself on other parts of someone else.  Coming down off it, I felt like I was about to take a really tough exam; super anxious.  Frankly, more trouble finding the stuff than it was worth.7. Ecstasy, sort of the same as above, but more of a \"super confident and cool\" sensation.  I couldn't sleep for shit afterwards though.8.

Anyway, I really felt like the Lord was speaking directly to me through the priest, telling me it was okay to feel the way I felt sometimes and that things would get better.

You are never allowed to know the time). The entire weekend is basically you being lectured by adults (think of a pastor's sermon but 8 hours long) and never being left unchaperoned. It was an annoying way to spend a weekend but not the worst thing ever, until the final night. Everything was super secretive and none of the attendees were allowed to know the itinerary, so you'd just go where you were told and sit there for hours. On this night, we were led into the chapel with the lights off and surrounded by a group of chaperones so that we couldn't see behind us. We went through a cycle of intense prayer and meditation and led to believe we were otherwise alone in the room.Except we weren't, because when the lights came on, the \"surprise\" was that everyone's parents (and a bunch of random community members) had filed into the church. But we weren't allowed to chat with them; instead, they formed a receiving line and we were instructed to *hug* each and every person (there were several hundred). I am very private with my body and do not like being touched; I tried communicating this to multiple chaperones who insisted I go through the hug line regardless.To this day, that remains the biggest panic attack I've had in my life. Being surprise-forced to hug 300 strangers probably doesn't sound traumatizing until it's one of your worst fears. When I got to the end of the line, I was greeted by the head priest, who had always made me really uncomfortable as he would go out of his way to touch people (imo) unnecessarily. I grimaced and offered a quick side hug, to which he announced, \"that's not a real hug!\" And gave me an extended full-body squeeze. I was trying so hard not to cry.The worst part is that all my friends and classmates who had already been to the retreat knew full well that the hugging line was the advertised \"big surprise!\" but refused to tell me.

We were baptist, but came to the church when I was around 8 or so, so when I was 11 or so I had to make the decision to be baptized and also to be saved.I remember being baptized felt good because there was basically a crowd of people cheering for me. When I made the decision to be \"saved\" I had been told over and over that it would be this profound and beautiful experience. But, when I met with my Sunday School teacher to do it... I didn't feel anything. I tried to force myself to cry. Nothing happened. I felt nothing.I thought there was something wrong with me, so I decided to study really hard. I thought I could figure out how to be a really really good Christian by reading the Bible myself. I started from the beginning, read through Genesis, and all the begetting and so on and so forth. I tried so hard to understand, because I wanted to have the spiritual experience like they told me I was supposed to have, but a lot of it went over my head, or I didn't absorb it because it was just so dense and dry for my kid brain.It wasn't until I got to the story of Job that I really started to question things. When I read about how Job's kids were allowed to be killed to prove a point, I got really upset. I mean, I WAS a kid at the time. I was just property? Able to be destroyed? But I was my own person with my own thoughts and feelings. How could God allow that many people to be murdered to prove a point when they didn't have anything to do with it? What if they weren't good? Did they go to Hell? How is that fair? They didn't have a chance to repent or learn. Did they get a free pass into Heaven? How is that fair? What if they were shitty? Why is God making bets with the devil anyway? Why was Job not allow to be killed but all his kids could be?From that point on I started seeing the holes in things. More contradictions of the bible and from the adults around me started to become clear. I spent a while trying to have my own version of god, then spent awhile being agnostic, then eventually just realized I was functionally atheist, and that I could be a better person being atheist than I saw most Christians around me being, so I just focused on being kind and understanding and trying to be a good person in general.

For a really simple example - at some point we both realized we mostly got into fights when either one or both of us were: a. hungry b. tired c. stressed or d. all of the above. If we're both well rested and fed and relaxed, we do disagree about things, even argue vigorously about them, but it doesn't turn into a fight. So nowadays if things are getting heated one of us usually will say, \"you know, I'm too tired/hungry/stressed to talk about this now\" and we leave it until the next day or so. Or if it really can't wait we both try extra hard to stay calm. The more I think of it - a lot of things haven't really changed a lot over the years, it's more that we both have accepted each other's quirks where in the beginning we might have tried to change each other more. And we've learned to recognize the ways we both show love to each other, also in the more subtle less obvious ways. And being together for a longer time, feeling more relaxed and secure, makes it easier to be more open about feelings, which in turn makes us closer, so that's a sort of positive feedback loop going on. The practical side of living together has gotten easier because over the years we've had all the little household negotiations and by now we know pretty well what an acceptable compromise looks like.

We started living together the day after our first date due to a series of unfortunate events so that definitely made us more serious much more quickly. You get so used to having someone that loves you and is with you that sometimes it gets forgotten- like when you think you lost your watch but it's been on your wrist the whole time, you just stopped feeling it. Realizing again that there is someone there loving you always is a huge rush. Our arguments have changed. We get more pissed off about things that regularly come up, but there's not the same do-or-die feel to the arguments themselves. There aren't any huge existential differences, even when big bad things happen. Example- I was recently laid off and was the sole income source. We didn't fight over that but we engaged in quite the bitch fit over me buying the wrong peanuts at the store. Which leads to the next thing- shitty things are going to happen. Getting through a hardship together is, you know, hard. But the way you do it forges your relationship. Somebody's going to get sick, or fired, or a loved one will die, or any number of shitty milestones. And it can be very unpleasant in the meantime- being forced to deal with that unpleasantness together shows you what your relationship looks like when it isn't all dates and flowers and butterflies. Because just like wounded animals we all get more snappy when hurt. The person who made you dizzy just from smiling at you is suddenly going to seem like the biggest asshole in existence. Whether the actual bad thing happened to one or the other of you doesn't matter- you'll still find the other to be a real shit heel at some point in the process. I know people point to that hackneyed Marilyn Monroe quote as being total shit. And it is, especially when you use it as an excuse to be an asshole. But the uncomfortable truth is that at some point in a long term relationship, they will see you at your worst.

Some latitudes are regions of upwelling (zones), and have high ammonia cloud-tops, while other latitudes are regions of downwelling (belts), and have low ammonia cloud-tops, as shown in [this diagram](http://i.imgur.com/TbVjwr6.jpg). In between these high and low heights sits a thick brown hydrocarbon haze (not shown in the diagram), very chemically similar to smog. The cloud-tops in the zones are sticking up above most of the haze and thus appear fairly white. The cloud-tops in the belts, though, lie below the haze layer, and thus appear colored brown by the overlying haze.For the occasional bluish regions seen just to the north and south of the equator (as indicated by the arrow [here](http://i.imgur.com/hlKqKnu.jpg)), these are some of the rare cloud clearings that occur in very strong downwelling regions. We're actually peering through the ammonia top cloud layer, and perhaps even down through the ammonium hydrosulfide middle cloud layer and the bottom water cloud layer. So, in those regions we're looking at just clear air, which has the exact same color as it does one Earth, blue. This is entirely due to Rayleigh scattering, the same reason that Earth's sky is blue.Then there's the reds, notably in Jupiter's Great Red Spot, although also occasionally seen in another big vortex here and there. As of right now, we *don't actually know* what makes the Great Red Spot red - this is generally known as the Jovian chromophore problem. Since this color is only seen in very large vortices, it's believed to be caused by some mixture of compounds already present on the planet getting pushed very high in the atmosphere by these vortices. In three dimensions, the Great Red Spot is essentially shaped like a wedding cake, so the cloud-tops at the center of the spot are at very high altitudes where there's a lot more ultraviolet light. You can end up producing all kinds of odd substances through UV photochemistry of trace substances in the atmosphere, and the working hypothesis at this point is that it's some kind of [imine or azine](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103516001494).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 88104, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 20 17:37:37 2017", "ups": 5}], "subreddit": "askscience", "selftext": "Relevant to other planets too, but Jupiter seems like a good example.

It's also simplified the method they use for reinforcement learning, bringing it down from two separate neural networks that are pulled together using a Monte Carlo Tree Search, to just one neural network. >[AlphaGo Zero] learns from self\u00ad play reinforcement learning, starting from random initial weights, without using rollouts, with no human supervision and using only the raw board history as input features. It uses just a single machine in the Google Cloud with 4 TPUs (AlphaGo Zero could also be distributed, but we chose to use the simplest possible search algorithm)AlphaGo Zero was also trained in a matter of days! So not only were they able to strip away all human supervision and abstraction above the raw inputs, but the speed at which this algorithm was trained was pretty impressive, too.

This can also be misused to supress criticism of the Commander in Chief.

This is a astoninglishly simply way to supress those critics by just calling them back on AD and putting them under the UCMJ again.Ok this is painting it black - I know - but orders like these always give me the creeps, because they keep you (a vet) from being a private citizen if you don't keep pleasing your former command essentially...", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 21149, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Fri Oct 20 23:04:56 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "I'm retired Air Force.

Wilson truly did the impossible, and we are eternally grateful,\" FBI Director James Comey said.> The gunbattle that had the highest casualty count in FBI history happened 29 years ago Saturday in southwest Miami-Dade County, in what is now Pinecrest.> Two robbers of armored trucks and banks had murdered several people during a seven-month spree and they were cornered at 12201 SW 82nd Ave. Dove and Grogan wounded the gunmen but were trapped in their car and killed, the bureau said.> The six other agents who responded were outgunned and their protective vests did not withstand fire from the robbers' .223 caliber Ruger rifle and .357 Magnum handgun.> During a fusillade of 145 shots, one of the seriously wounded agents thought he was going to die, too. But one-time U.S. Marine Edmundo Mireles Jr. charged the gunmen and, with one arm, fired a shotgun and killed them.> \"I am the lucky one,\" said Mireles, a consultant for a Washington, D.C., defense contractor who is retired from the bureau and was singled out for recognition Friday. \"[Grogan and Dove] took the brunt of the attacks.\"> Two other special agents who survived that day, Gilbert M. Orrantia and John F. Hanlon Jr., were also present Friday. They and relatives and friends of Grogan, Dove and Special Agents Gordon G. McNeill, Richard A. Manauzzi and Ronald Risner received tri-folded American flags that have flown over the new headquarters.> \"There are no words that are adequate,\" Comey said of the men's sacrifice that day. It changed how agents and police officers arm themselves and respond to such incidents. Risner was the only agent who was not hurt; Orrantia and Manauzzi were injured and Mireles, Hanlon and McNeill were seriously wounded.> \"We will never, ever forget,\" Comey said.

I think they need to remove quite a few C-level leadership there because it displayed behavior that hurts their company themselves as well as everyone in the industry, the businesses that buy their system, as well at the product itself which could soon be unreliable.  Then, they tried to cover it up, sold stock on knowledge, ruined the liability available while almost destroying their industry due to negligence and not installing an update.  They likely ruined their product, the lives of the people that don't have the income to buy stuff outright, and the industry itself.

They put out an \"all new\" lineup of heroes. This included Thor (they made a point of calling her [Thor](https://www.sideshowtoy.com/assets/products/300523-thor-jane-foster/lg/marvel-thor-jane-foster-premium-format-300523-03.jpg) and not Lady Thor or Ms. Thor), [Hawkeye](https://img.purch.com/o/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdzYXJhbWEuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9pLzAwMC8xODMvNzA5L29yaWdpbmFsL0hhd2tleWVfMV9Db3Zlci5qcGc=) ([Kate Bishop](http://68.media.tumblr.com/227cded5232da10ef130dfe3e3cfcc4a/tumblr_nj3xxjyR821rqu9t0o1_500.png)), [Wolverine](https://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2016/09/559c283632b35-1.jpg) ([Laura Kinney](https://i0.wp.com/www.comicbookrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/All-New-Wolverine-017-1.jpg)), and [Ms. Marvel](http://ultimatecomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1-11-2015-15.jpg) (a young muslim who wears a lot more clothing than the previous Ms. Marvel did). DC is behind the curve on this one, but I expect them to follow suit following the financial success of Wonder Woman (which has also been one of their best selling books of the last few years.

I typed out a bunch of different facebook statuses but couldn't bring myself to hit submit, because of the drama it would cause and it feels like I'm in a minority.I shared my #metoo on facebook, a few days ago when so many other women were doing so too. I didn't add any details, just the copy-paste message that came from the original tweet. Initially I found it quite liberating, nice to be part of something where a trauma that was so painful wasn't just my problem. Other people were hurt too, in the same way. It was cathartic.Then, somebody well meaning wrote [this](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2017/10/man-metoo-has-made-me-reassess-my-past-sexual-encounters) article. I don't think it's a bad article. In a way, I think it's good that the #metoo campaign has made men rethink their behaviours and reflect on where they might be going wrong.HOWEVER. First one male friend posted it. And I saw that my abuser, somebody I haven't spoken to in two years and who I don't have as a friend on facebook, was commenting on and liking this mutual friend's article post. He, and a few others of his friends (not my friends on facebook, but we have mutual friends and their social media is pretty public) started reposting the article, with their own hashtags. #Ididthat. #NowIknowbetter.They were all liking each others statuses. Other men who I didn't know were liking, and commenting about how brave they are, how wonderful they were for coming forward with this information, what good guys they are for treating women well now.He never once apologised to me. He wasn't like the men in the article, making naive mistakes and assuming consent. He systematically and maliciously abused me over four years. He gaslighted me. He cut me off from my support system. He hurt me, physically and mentally, in so many ways that are still hurting now, three years since I left him. When I left, he laughed in my face. He mocked me for staying for so long. He moved straight onto the next girl to treat the same way. He never said sorry. He isn't sorry.So many women have posted about how the #metoo campaign has dredged up old trauma, and how they've found it a difficult process and that they can't contribute. When I posted my #metoo, it felt a bit better. Now it just feels empty. Like it doesn't matter, because he and these other men have co-opted this movement and made it about themselves. They're congratulating each other under the #Ididthat hashtag. Like, I can not even begin to explain how angry I am. How much I want to tag all of them and lay out exactly how dismissive and disgusting their hashtags are, and how they make me feel. But I can't even do that, because then it'll be public knowledge on facebook, the rumour mill will kick off, and no matter how I phrase it I'll come off as a mean bitter bitch.This hurts so much more than I thought it would. I don't know how to deal with it. I hope these hashtags aren't spreading further than this social circle. I'm sorry if this whole post is just a word vomit. This has brought up so much unhappiness that I hid away from that time. It feels like they're laughing at me, at all the women under #metoo.

I wasn't going to post this. I was going to let this trend go on like those hashtag trends usually do, until they are forgotten a few weeks later as though they never happened. But last night I went to get groceries. As I got out of the store there was a man in a black track suit. Probably going on a run I thought, as he gave me a weak acknowledgement smile. I have the right to get fucking groceries at night. I won't let a single experience that happened a decade ago deprive me of food, through a fear of being assaulted. So I started walking home, and the man stayed behind for a while, but then started slowly running towards me. I started walking faster, until he started catching up to me, at which point full panic mode set in, and I started running, but he started sprinting as well, and I just remember my mind screaming \"No\" over and over again, as I realized there was no way in hell I could outrun this man. Then he ran past me. He was just going on a night jog. Maybe he was just trying to screw with me on purpose, maybe he was oblivious to the terror he caused me. It doesn't matter, as much as I wished in that moment that he would have said something like, \"just doing a night jog, no need to worry,\" or something, I realize it is also a hell of a world to live in where you can't even go jogging without some psycho woman thinking you're a rapist. So #metoo, ladies. And I'm not sharing this because it was an unbearable experience. Because truth be told, the experience itself wasn't that bad. Lots of pain, lots of blood, but it didn't last that long. It was over soon before it started. It's having to live with it, the inability to cope and the terrible, terrible, and absolutely terrible life choices that came after it that made it post worthy. It's the knowledge that it will never be undone, and neither will be a million of its side effects, stemming from a naive 16 year old just not being emotionally, or otherwise equipped to deal with rape. Or getting pregnant from it. Or the nightmares that just wouldn't stop and only get worse as time went on, until the only solution that made sense was sleep deprivation. All the things that came next, getting kicked out of the house for being a pregnant teen, having a miscarriage for a baby that I knew would ruin my life, but I still saw as the only good thing to come out of it, now gone too. Years of trying to have sex with anyone that would say yes, just to show myself that I could, and with each failed attempt, convincing myself that I will never be normal. The nightmares, never ending, always something to look forward at the end of the day. Cutting, when too afraid to go for the kill. Failed suicide attempts. Therapy, years later after finally having insurance that would cover it, only to realize that won't undo it either. And finally, being slapped in the face with reality each time I allow myself to believe it was just something that happened a long time ago, and it's over, and I can totally do normal things, like buying groceries after work, without being crippled by it. So #metoo ladies, and it won't ever be over.

But I\u2019ve probably encountered it the most in my own mind ever since I realized that some of my experiences were forms of sexual assault. Even since realizing that the things that happened to me were wrong, I still have a very hard time for seeing them as they are...sexual assault. I had wrongly only associated the word \u201cassault\u201d with violent bodily harm, which has made it harder for me to be real with myself about what happened.I\u2019m posting to come out with my own #metoo story because I\u2019m not comfortable sharing out on Facebook, but also to let others know that if they are wondering if something that made them uncomfortable \u201ccounts\u201d, it does! I've never shared this in this detail with anyone, not even my boyfriend or best friend. A lot of it was with my first boyfriend who was emotionally abusive. I was a virgin when we started dating. The sexual abuse started when he made me feel bad for putting a stop to things when we were making out and getting physical, that it was basically the worst thing to do to a guy, which affected the way I was intimate with some guys after him. So I just gave in to please him, without really thinking about what I wanted out of it. I lost my virginity to him, but what I didn\u2019t realize until several years later was that I didn\u2019t get a say in losing it. At the time, I was religious (no longer anymore) and had been dating my boyfriend for 2 years. He knew I wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, and we had done everything except sex until that point. We were messing around with no clothes on and his penis just slowly crept into my vagina, not all the way but still penetrated. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on. Looking back, I think I froze. After it took his penis out, he looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad we did that\u201d. At no point, did he ask me if I was okay with it or if I was ready, despite us having waited 2 years to have sex at that point and knowing how important it was to me at the time. I think I was so shocked and ashamed with myself for \u201cletting\u201d it happen, that I kind of had to just accept that I lost my virginity. What\u2019s more fucked up is, with cognitive dissonance in full gear, I convinced myself that I actually was okay with it (after all, people my age were having sex anyways), and even told him I was glad it happened, despite the shock pulsing within me. Later on, I went through bouts of shame and expressed to him multiple times, sometimes while crying, that I wanted to stop having sex and to wait until we were married (I had naively thought we would get married, thank goodness that didn\u2019t happen). But he would say \u201cokay\u201d and dismissed what I said, and try to have sex with me anyways, and I just \u201clet\u201d him. Sex was never enjoyable with him, I always felt it was something to endure. Even though I know the majority of sexual assault and rape happens from people we know, the fact that it was my own boyfriend still made it hard for me to really admit to myself what happened even as I type this. I would kind of freeze similarly with other guys I got intimate with in the future, and blamed myself \"letting\" it happen. There were a few other guys I went on first dates with who had tried to kiss me even though I wasn\u2019t comfortable yet. All of these experiences, I felt were hard to \u201ccount\u201d for a #metoo experience because it was with someone I was dating.

Which I guess isn\u2019t end of the world, just kind of a weird thing to say. But the main issue I have is the non stop questions. He asks me nonstop my \u201cfeminist opinion\u201d on certain topics. Like sexism in gaming. Or sexism in relationships. A good example is the recent #metoo campaign. He messaged me to ask me what it was about and I explained that anyone writing #metoo was openly identifying that they were victims of sexual assault/harassment. So he asked me how I defined sexual assault. What is assault? What is consent? Is there a gray area with consent? He had the whole attitude of \u201cit should be sooo obvious what consent is. I mean if a girl shirks away from my touch, that\u2019s obviously not consent. Guys need to be like me and learn to read the signs\u201d. He asked about why abuse is not reported / dealt with legally more often, and went off on a rant about corrupt cops when I responded. It felt like pandering. He asked me what I think of abuse within family context. He wanted details. What about a scenario where a father abuses a daughter? Why would he do that? Why would the girl not speak up? Why would the mom not do anything?He asked me in exhausting detail to explain how that could possibly happen. Then he asked me the exact same questions but with regards to \u201cless close family members, like an uncle or a cousin\u201d. And at this point I lose my temper and tell him he needs to do his own research. I tell him that if he cares to actually be an ally to women, he can do the research on this very common topic and he doesn\u2019t need a woman to baby step him through why abuse is bad. The entire thing felt like instead of caring about the topic, he was trying to pander to my strong feminist belief system and get on my good side, but I didn\u2019t bite because it all felt so sickly sweet and insincere. He acts like this 100% of the time around me. When ever we play a game together, he announces over mics \u201clet\u2019s do this, boys \u2014\u0000\u2014\u0000 and girl!\u201d If someone says a sexist slur like bitch or cunt, instead of telling the guy off, he makes a comment about how he would never say that because he\u2019s a gentleman.

My main account is known by real life acquaintances. Excuse the wall of text, it's quite a long story.)I was 18. A \"late bloomer.\" Most of my friends were religious or had unusually strict parents. There wasn't a lot of sexual experimentation in my social circle. Even though I was legally an adult, I was still thrilled if a guy I liked put his arm around me at the movies... Transferring to a new school in my final year meant there were required classes I hadn't taken yet, so I was placed in classes with mostly freshmen. I didn't mind. I was slightly immature for my age, after all. In photography class, I quickly became friends with a 15 year old student, let's call him \"Jake.\"One school holiday when my parents were working, Jake called me and asked if I wanted to come hang out at his grandma's house. She was a rich old lady who let Jake convert part of her garage into a sort of game room/lounge for him to hang out in. I said yes. I had done it a couple times before. I had to take the bus across town since I couldn't drive. At the time, I was prescribed a cocktail of sedatives for my panic disorder. (I had recently been in a car accident because I \"blacked out\" behind the wheel.) This time, losing my memory would ruin my life much worse than a shattered windshield ever could. I remember sitting with Jake, drinking sodas and talking, and the next thing I can recall, he was holding me down, forcing a foreign object I couldn't see into my vagina. I tried to push him off... I had just had my first kiss a few months ago, I didn't WANT this... But he was a football player and wrestler, stronger than me. He kept whispering \"shh, shh.\" I froze. When he was finished, I excused myself and went home in a daze, knowing my first sexual experience was NOT supposed to feel how it did. I decided I would keep it a secret... Until the next day when I was cramping and bleeding, not on schedule for my period. I told the school nurse and she told the police. The investigator didn't understand why I couldn't remember details of the encounter, even after my mom telling her my psych meds had caused those effects before. When she visited Jake to get his side of the story, Jake told her I had visited him more than once. (YES. HE WAS MY FRIEND.) He said I came onto him and coerced him into touching me. It was a small town. The investigator was friends with his family. If I had known what was coming, I probably would have committed suicide at 18. Suddenly, I wasn't the victim anymore. I was the defendant in a year long court case to prove my innocence. Jake was weeks from the age of consent. (16) My therapist defended me, reporting that I was unusually UNinterested in sex for a teenage girl... My mom gave testimony of my inexperience in relationships. (Dad stayed out of it because he was afraid the case would \"tarnish his reputation as a city employee\" -- he was a city bus driver.) JAKE'S OWN PARENTS reported that their son had manipulated other girls and they believed my innocence. I lost anyway. The prosecuting attorney originally wanted me sentenced to prison for five years and on the sex offender registry, based on hearsay. My public defender talked her down to a plea deal. If I plead no contest/Alford plea and remained on unsupervised probation for five years, the charge would be dismissed, what was called a stay of adjudication. I knew I couldn't handle a jury trial with my anxiety. Taking the plea was the only way I was guaranteed to go home to my family. For five years, I couldn't work the most basic of jobs. Wal-Mart, Subway, a local grocery store, all turned me down because when they did a background check, this is what came up: 3rd degree felony criminal sexual conduct with a minor. If my mom hadn't died and left behind retirement and pension savings, I would have been homeless. Thanks to that unfortunate luck (and a lot of loans), I was able to finish college without working. I graduated with a bachelor's degree and no work experience. I'm 27 now, and just starting to see how this has (and will continue to) affect the rest of my life. When I was background checked in order to volunteer with special needs children at my church, the charge no longer comes up. But the federal government will have this on file until I die. It can never be expunged. I can never live in another country, or even visit one that requires a background check like Canada or Australia (and it would be nearly impossible to sponsor an international fiance or spouse if I met one). I can never adopt or foster a child. I can never work at a school, in a hospital, or for the government. I am 5 years behind where I should be in work experience. I'll be 28 in a month and work for $8.20 an hour at a shopping mall. Jake joined the military. He has a girlfriend now and a well-paying job. After the assault, I was left with vaginismus, which means I can't have sex without intense pain. I can't even wear tampons because they hurt too much. If someone expresses sexual interest in me, I'm immediately repulsed by them (or worse, afraid)...even if I had romantic feelings for them before.I'm not in the financial situation to afford therapy (even the low-income clinic costs too much), but I hope someday I'll find healing. I don't know what it's like to not feel broken. I'm carrying a weight that's so heavy and I don't know how to let it go. I don't want to feel like a criminal anymore.#metoo", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "77j9ei", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "#metoo - Accused of a felony sex crime after being assaulted by a minor.", "num_comments": 5, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 9, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 2, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/77j9ei/metoo_accused_of_a_felony_sex_crime_after_being/", "submission_time": "Fri Oct 20 06:30:06 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Idk what to say except that I am so sorry that you had to go through all that.

I am a 23 year old, who is largely involved in politics. My demographic is often referred to as a Millennial or twenty something\u2019s. I have been actively engaged in calling anyone who holds any power or influence in Colorado. This includes the governor, Congress people, judges, city council members, ect. Anyone who has authority and anyone who is willing to listen. I just called an individual, and asked them what their stance was on Net Neutrality. After they explained to me what their stance was (it was for stripping away Title 2 regulation), I asked if I could politely attempt a counter argument. This individual then asked me what my age was. I said 23. Then the individual said \u201cI do appreciate you reaching out to me today and asking me questions. However, the Millennial voter base doesn\u2019t matter, when it comes to voting time. I will gladly listen to your counter argument, but I want to make it clear that I will be listening to my voter populace, and that you are the first individual to approach me about my stance on net neutrality.\u201dWhile this did make me angry, I thanked the individual for their time and hung up. I was so angry, that I immediately went to Reddit afterwards and started typing up a flaming hot post that was jam packed with all my anger and frustrations. Then I stopped. I went through and re-read my freshly typed and still smoking post. It was so angry, and pointless. What good will it do to post something like that to Reddit? Instead, it got me thinking... Why is the Millennial vote unimportant? Why am I the first person to reach out to a particular representative, when I\u2019ve been seeing top page posts on the same subject for months on end now? Then it hit me - Millennial\u2019s aren\u2019t voting. Millennial\u2019s aren\u2019t attending city and state events and hearings. Millennial\u2019s aren\u2019t calling their representatives and making their thoughts and opinions heard. But what are we doing? We\u2019re being incredibly loud on Reddit and social media. Seriously, every time I log into Facebook, I see all my friends passionately posting and debating issues that matter to them. I get onto Reddit, and the front page makes me feel like there is a political revolution going on. But in actuality, all that is happening is someone sees something they agree with. They upvote it, and they might make a comment. Then they move on, feeling good about themselves. So I raise you all this - Something needs to change! Our representatives don\u2019t think Millennial\u2019s opinions are worthless. In fact, they know we are an untapped gold mine of votes. However, they will not focus on issues that matter to Millennial\u2019s, because it alienates their actual voter base, and Millennial\u2019s simply do not vote enough. So please, please, PLEASE! If you are a Millennial, and you haven\u2019t made your voice heard in the form of a phone call of a vote, start today! We all have done it. I\u2019ve done it, way more than once actually. We all see a post that we are super passionate about, we upvote it, we read some comments and maybe contribute a comment. But then we do nothing about it. We just assume someone else will make the call. Someone else will fight on my behalf. Think that you might be the first person to contact a representative in your state on a particular issue. Also, don\u2019t think of yourself as just a drop in a bucket. There is powers in numbers, and you can easily flood a bucket with thousands of drops. Sorry for the lengthy post. If you\u2019ve been on the fence, or need help getting started, then please ask me or anyone whose willing to help in this post! It\u2019s easier than you think, the hardest part is convincing yourself to get involved! Thanks for your time and thanks for the read!

The problem is that they know full well that once the mother started using the samples, the mother's own milk would dry up and she would be hooked onto the formula, which she would have to buy, or else her baby would die.- The expense meant that mothers could not afford it but now also meant that they could not breast feed. Their babies died of starvation. - Some mothers had some money and started using less powder, which wasn't enough to sustain a baby. Guess what happened? Yep, babies died of malnutrition.- Even if mothers had money, there is a severe lack of clean water to mix the formula with. Yep, more babies died from water contamination and diarrhoea.- Even if the mothers had money and clean water, breast milk is especially important in developing countries as it contains antibodies which the mother passes onto the baby - these protect against diseases. This could no longer happen. Guess what? Babies died of diseases which they would otherwise have been protected against.- Nestle knew this would happen, just as tobacco companies knew their products kill people but lobbied for decades to have the evidence and studies buried.EDIT: People were asking for sources.

I'm not saying I don't think a good athletics program isn't important folks, my problem is that it's going straight to the boy's football team and not much elsewhere.  A bit of backstory, in 2001 the school used tax money to build a multimillion dollar stadium, but they ALSO built that awesome library at the same time.  Fair enough, right?   Well I'm guessing that big stadium brought in enough money to do the big remodel that happened around 2011.   However, they cut a shit load of arts, music, language and drama programs while I was in high school between 2005 and 2009.  Then they go and turn that sick af library and computer lab into a fucking gym.  We already had 3 gyms, including a soft floor wrestling gym that was put in during that first remodel. So here's the boy's football team getting bathed in money, yet the girls' teams and the less popular boy sports teams are out begging for money along the roads every weekend during their seasons as fundraisers.  It's not okay to lift up one tiny, tiny percentage of students but ignore the rest of the population.   They also cut a lot of AP science  and language programs too, that's not cool!  I had to go from French III to French V Honors because they cut languages and didn't have enough teachers for every level.  That sucked, I struggled keeping up with the more advanced students but I really wanted to learn French and I'd already devoted several years to it. Just because some kids might not be interested in science, languages or music, doesn't mean you should punish the ones who are.  We're all in school to learn and develop interests that will build us into adults, how can all kids do this if they're blocked from participating in things they're interested in?

This fu**ing guy.  No other felon in the entire state of Arizona gets to EVER, I repeat EVER have their felonies expunged. It's the b.s. law in that state - doesn't matter if it's been 50 years and it was a non-violent, non-repetitive, lowest possible class of felony. According to the current law you will die with that on your record. The best any felon in the state can ever hope for is to get their conviction \"set aside\", which means and changes literally nothing because your felony STILL shows up on your record and the listing might or might not actually mention it being \"set aside\". I ought to know, the same thing happened to me 20 years ago. I've clawed my way back from that and it was a nightmare to get there. I've had five official job offers rescinded (even though I was 100% honest about my conviction), I've been prevented from doing charity work ffs, I've even recently had an application for apartments rejected (they didn't care how long it had been or the nature of the offense). So while most states clear your record in seven years, I get to live with this stigma my entire life because of where I lived when I was a stupid 18 year old kid who- brace yourselves this might shock you - made a bad choice. It doesn't matter that I've educated myself. It doesn't matter that I've never broken the law again. It doesn't matter that I served no jail time and got out of probation early.  It doesn't matter that I've actually slogged my way out of one job after another that knew I was overqualified and took advantage of my record, paying me nowhere near what others in my field routinely make because they knew I had few choices. None of that matters, my records WILL NEVER CHANGE. And you know what?  I made my bed, I should sleep in it. I learned from the experience, I've worked extremely hard to make up for it, and I'm stronger because of it. But this WEASEL, this cringing loathsome, nausea inducing attention seeking lying cheating sack of excrement knowingly and willingly made the choice to break the law he pretends to uphold, gets away with it entirely, doesn't even have to deal with the nightmare of a prison system he spent YEARS making as demeaning and unpleasant as he could possibly make it (beyond anything even close to resembling a normal US prison), and he has the gall to try to weasel his way out of having a record?  Unbelievable. This man has learned nothing. He is a criminal and will never be anything else.I would say that I'm happy that he got denied, but that would require me to believe for one second that he won't find some other way to get it expunged. He can't just live with it like others have had to do their entire lives, no, that would mean he's just like every other citizen (read: peon) in this state. Why live with it when you know you can call in a favor, game the system, and come out smelling like roses?  This COWARD deserves to live with that stigma, but clearly he won't.

It is the largest sheriff's office in the state of Arizona and provides general and specialized law enforcement to unincorporated areas of Maricopa County, serving as the primary law enforcement for unincorporated areas of the county as well as incorporated cities within the county which have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services. It also operates the county jail system. Elected in 2016, Paul Penzone is the current sheriff of Maricopa County. Penzone replaced Joe Arpaio after his 24-year tenure as sheriff.According to the Washington Post, on 17 August 2010, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division opened an inquiry into the Sheriff's Department in relation to alleged racism and abuse of power, as well as refusing to cooperate with a federal Justice Department investigation.[1]On December 15, 2011, the US Justice Department released its finding that the Sheriff's department repeatedly arrested Latinos illegally, abused them in the county jails and failed to investigate hundreds of sexual assaults. The Department of Homeland Security, reacting to the Justice Department report, revoked Maricopa County jail officers' authority to detain people on immigration charges.[2] The Justice Department report found that the Sheriff's office carried out a blatant pattern of discrimination against Latinos and held a \"systematic disregard\" for the United States Constitution.[3] The Department's racial profiling expert found the sheriff's office to be the most egregious case of profiling ever seen in the United States.[4]IN HISTORY for fuck sake how much more do you need to - PARDON HIM - wait what the fuck just happened someone pardoned him!@?

I lean to the left but this does not pass the smell test. A few things.1. I don't like kids being used by their parents as political proxies. I don't think he wrote those questions.2. I don't think what she said about race and health was coming from a place of hate but rather an instance of poor wording. There are some health factors that come from genetic predispositions , cultural habits and lower socio-economic status. When she talks about food she is saying that despite what she said about genetic factors the food is so good that pretty much everyone would be impacted to some degree but those with those predispositions more so. This was an attempt at humor and an appeal to southerners since quality food is often considered a source of pride. The fact that chicken was mentioned has people's racism  feelers out.  The news report also says fried chicken and she only said chicken.3. He asked why she was mocking black people. He did not do his research before asking this question because she was not mocking. She responded very well to this accusation. 4. The second question was misleading. The bill she voted against also included a provision that would remove gun rights from people subject to certain protection orders. Things get tacked onto common sense bills that make it not possible to vote for. The right political machine pushes for weak gun control but I could see this part of the bill being a legit problem given her beliefs. I am for pretty strong gun control but I think the question she was given intentionally painted a false/misleading narrative.4. Both questions were poorly researched and misleading. The fact that they were so misleading makes me think the parents were in on it.5. The news broadcast was pushing their view hardcore. Saying that her comments were racially charged puts a slant on what she said before the viewer even hears what she said. Saying she said fried chicken when she just said chicken makes it sound worse. Saying she was rusty on her recollection says she was lying or wrong about what she said when from what I have seen she maintained her stance and her recollection of events remained consistent.EVERYONE LOVES CHICKEN and she said that everyone loves chicken. Saying one group of people likes chicken is not racist but she did not even do that. She said that people in the south eat unhealthy food and black people are hit harder by the negative effects of that type of food.As far as the kid getting kicked out I think that is the wrong way to go. I would rather see them talk the issues out with him and his family. I think that his mom is pulling his strings and I don't think he should be punished for that. This could have been a critical learning experience for the kid and they tossed it out. Both sides should have been focusing on the development of the kid but they want to play politics with a child.
