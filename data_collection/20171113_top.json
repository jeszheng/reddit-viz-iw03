Possible answers...- Nothing. Wikileaks has always been falsely claiming nobility and is nothing more than a nihilist anarchist organization that wants to do something along the lines of tear down existing governments (more or less Russia's goal too).- Ever since Assange was framed by the Clinton/Obama faction of the U.S. government he's diverted the organization's mission into doing whatever possible harm he can do to them. This was my theory as to why they happily leaked the Podesta emails during the campaign, with no dirt from the Trump camp. The only way out for Assange was defeating Clinton. This even explains why they'd urge Trump to contest the election (imagine what a headache that would be for Hillary).- These messages to Jr.aren't from Wikileaks at all, but a Russian operative pretending to be them. Most actions suggested by Wikileaks would benefit Russia's standing in the world by sowing chaos in rival governments. Some were just to just to bolster Wikileaks credibility, but that too would help Russia.Some in this thread are suggesting this is direct evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. I don't see it that way.  There have been a lot of accusations from the left about Wikileaks being a Russian front, but there hasn't been direct proof. Even if it is found that Wikileaks is working directly with Russian intelligence, the Trump campaign members still have deniability. It was Wikileaks they thought we were engaging with, not Russia.

We have Putin running a successful oligarchical dictatorship in Russia, and people like Trump (and Pence and many of the authoritarian right) simply wish they could do this themselves. It\u2019s come from believing their own rhetoric. They seem to genuinely believe democracy is a failed institution, and that they want to distance themselves from the democracy of Europe which they view as a socialist basket case; shared goals of destroying the EU, which of course is in Putin\u2019s interest given his desire to retake Eastern Europe, and in US oligarch\u2019s interest, because they regard EU regulation of global interests too invasive on their business practices.Coupled with a shared social enemy - the conservative right would like to put gays back in their place with all the violent vigour that they see Putin enacting (enforcing a genuinely homophobic society).I don\u2019t know that Putin and US as allies would, or should ever be possible. Putin is backing various US-hostile interests (Iran etc) in the Middle East as various buffers against US influence in the region; they are not natural bedfellows.I think this is where the dichotomy comes. Trump plainly admires Putin, and plainly wishes he could run the US more like Putin runs Russia. I think he sincerely believes Russia can help him, and that the US and Russia could align.I think what he probably doesn\u2019t realise is that Russia has much broader, longer goals. They will help Trump in the short term - but he is being used as a pawn in a longer project of destabilisation. They know that Trump weakens America by his very personality, and they know that Trump\u2019s desire to be like Putin gives them considerable power over him.So I think we have Trump WANTING to be in cahoots with Putin because he firmly believes it would be best for America - but unable to admit to this publicly for the reasons of treason etc.... at the same time he, and his supporters in the right media, have been gradually making the message palatable that \u201cRussia is OK\u201d - and they seem to have been successful with that message to much of their base, who would all clearly prefer Putin as president rather than Clinton.On the other side, we have Putin, like a Cheshire Cat, in an unprecedented position of power; actively interfering with foreign elections through some very clever \u201ccyber-warfare\u201d, and probably slightly astounded that Trump is even there in the first place. Who knows what he has on Trump - I bet there\u2019s leverage from all sorts of dodgy dealings with Russians, even if there\u2019s no sex video or whatever. Apparently able to influence US policy (Russian sanctions) and all the while able to claim ignorance despite the mountains of evidence about Russian troll-factories etc. Getting Trump elected would have been an entertaining goal for Putin - no other candidate could have swung the balance of power further in Russia\u2019s favour - but that it happened at all must seem to Putin like all his christmases have come at once.

I am vehemently anti-Trump. But there is this thought that gives me trouble. Trump is right when he says that we need Russia to resolve the situations in North Korea, Syria, and elsewhere. Syria is a particularly convincing case. North Korea -shit can you imagine the response if the attack came from the North?Personally, I have long been interested in the \"europeanism\" of Russia. I have felt they have been ostracized from Europe because of the rift between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Byzantium, the head of the Church and the head of the state were the same, which mirrors the Church of England  (not to mention Islam). I don't recall that Putin has proclaimed himself head of the Russian Orthodox Church, but I could be wrong. He may well also be the head of Church in Russia.The issue is this - maybe Trump's pro-Russia agenda has to do with securing Russian support for solutions in multiple foreign policy crises. He doesn't give a shit about traditional morality. He's a psychopath/sociopath. But having Russia on our side is important for a wide variety of reasons. Russia could help us re: North Korea, but they won't do so until sanctions are lifted. Russia has been helping us in Syria. but who knows how far that will go? (It is their test case.)I know that the (successful) attempt to influence our elections is beyond words. But I also know that we need Russian cooperation to solve many of our foreign policy dilemmas. My question is, how the hell do we do that?There are people here a lot smarter than me. To me it seems that Trump is trying a strategy, essentially, of appeasement (toward Putin).

The left argues that people are to greedy and evil to be left alone and free. We must be controlled by the bourgeoisie-left. Only they and their supreme form of moral can guide us.

Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. These were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results.The infected and vivisected prisoners included men, women, children, and infants.Prisoners had limbs amputated in order to study blood loss. Those limbs that were removed were sometimes re-attached to the opposite sides of the body. Some prisoners' limbs were frozen and amputated, while others had limbs frozen, then thawed to study the effects of the resultant untreated gangrene and rotting.Some prisoners had their stomachs surgically removed and the oesophagus reattached to the intestines.

The thing is that cities/large towns are just better suited than rural areas for young people to live the kind of lives we (by and large, I'm generalising, there will obviously be exceptions and that's fine) want to lead. I'll give some examples.If I decide that I want to go, say, clothes shopping in my home community, that's a decision I have to make a week in advance because, not being able to afford a car, I will have to structure my shopping trip around the reasonably infrequent, expensive and unreliable buses which will take me the 45-minute journey to a medium-sized town which has shops selling what I want to buy. I will have to allocate a day and make sure I don't have any plans on that day, because the likelihood is that going shopping will take up most of it. This is particularly difficult around Christmas time, when bad weather making rural roads unsafe for buses and vastly increased amounts of shopping to carry home are also a consideration. Now let's say I want to go clothes shopping in my university city. The most I have to do is take a 20-minute walk, a 15-minute bike ride (unlike at home, this is a safe transportation option here), or a cheap 5-minute bus ride, which comes every 5-10 minutes. I can do however much shopping I like (money permitting obviously), because if I forget something or decide it's too much for me to carry, I can come back hassle-free. This takes at most an hour and a half.Let's take another example. Let's say that I have a day where I don't have work or study to do, and I want to have a day out and do something that interests me. There's nothing for me in my home community, as surprisingly, I am not intensely interested in agricultural history and while we get a lot of tourists I see what they come for every day (there's only so much time you can spend walking round National Trust properties anyway). As such, I will probably have to go to London, or possibly Canterbury or the Medway towns depending on what I want to see. This will involve me getting one of the relatively expensive and infrequent buses to the station, which is in an even smaller village, and then paying too much to get one or possibly more slow af trains. Already, we're getting to the point where the amount of time and money I've spent travelling is probably too much for what I wanted to do. I'll probably decide to stay at home and clean my desk or something. And I'm actually lucky in this regard because my interest happens to be history: if you're the kind of person who likes live music, or going on nights out, or that kind of thing, that's just a no. In my university city, I only have to step off campus and I have more history than I can shake a stick at, including what is despite the result of the Twitter poll clearly England's most beautiful cathedral, and more other interesting things to do than I have free time to do them in. As for nights out, I wouldn't know but the state of my flatmates on Sunday mornings is good testimony.You might be thinking if by any chance you're still reading this and haven't been bored to death yet that I'm just moaning about minor stuff, but there are more serious problems as well. There are very few police regularly on duty in my local community  - after all, it's tiny and they have limited resources. That means that if there's a serious crime here, it will usually take about 20 mins to half an hour for them to get here. Granted rural areas are generally safer, but a few years ago my mum saw a local handyman's van being broken into, his tools being stolen, and the tyres being slashed. She called the police, it took them half an hour, by that time the man in question had arrived on the scene and been beaten up and the culprits had got away, not ever being caught. The man subsequently went out of business because of the cost of repairing his van and getting new tools. If that happened in my university city, then judging from what I've heard from others the police would have been there within 5 to 10 minutes. There's a reason more people have guns in rural areas, and it's not just for hunting.Leading on from that, we also have no hospital nearby, meaning that if you have a medical emergency, you're fucked because it's at the very least an hour before you get beyond paramedic level medical care. That's relevant to me personally because I'm autistic and also have mental health issues that have been severe in the past: from past experience I know my mental health can get very bad very quickly and I am genuinely scared about what would happen if it was to get bad enough that I was a danger to myself or others while I was in my home community. Here in my university city, I know from having experienced freshers' week that it takes at most 10 minutes for an ambulance to get to you and about the same time to get to the hospital in the city centre. I feel much more comfortable with that time frame.You've also obviously got the issue of jobs. I want to actually have an income at some point in my life, and that's going to require me getting something other than 'helped out one day a week in the local library' on my CV. In my home community, the options for that are stacking shelves in the convenience store, stacking shelves in the supermarket, or working in the one out of our two pubs that tends to actually be hiring. (you're probably thinking what about agricultural work, but since Brexit the local farmers are mostly leaving what they can't pick themselves in the fields) Not great, particularly when there are several other people who are not all young and who are probably better suited in some way competing for the minimum wage job you want. I could go on. Now, I'm not trying to make out here that rural Britain is some third-world hellhole - it's possible to have a very nice life living rurally, and for all the problems there are some real positives. The countryside is beautiful, as are most small settlements, and if you like outdoorsy hobbies then that's obviously much easier in a rural setting. You also have the social side of having a close-knit community which a lot of people find comforting (though it can also be a bad thing). But the point I'm trying to make here is that rural life is just not compatible in most ways with what millennials (mostly) want or where we (mostly) see our lives going. Better broadband will bring a lot of benefits to rural communities, but it won't stop the outward flow of young people - trainline loading more quickly doesn't make my ticket to somewhere more interesting any cheaper.**tl;dr** It's not just internet speed, there are lots of other reasons why cities/large towns are better than rural areas for young people, better internet is a good thing but won't stop young people leaving.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 1955, "comment_id": "dpr42e1", "score": 37, "submission_time": "Mon Nov 13 17:03:08 2017", "ups": 37}, {"body": "Gotta get that ping in CSGO. aint nobody stopping them getting MG2", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 8718, "comment_id": "dpqyxc1", "score": 14, "submission_time": "Mon Nov 13 14:17:36 2017", "ups": 14}, {"body": "Soon as I see \"MELLENNIAL\" in the title, I immediately consider it an article by some 60 year old hack who is past his prime trying to sound edgy.But on point here, OH NO NOT WANTING TO LIVE IN THE STONE AGE?

Indeed, the first wide area fibre optic network was set up in Hastings, UK. But, in 1990, then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, decided that BT's rapid and extensive rollout of fibre optic broadband was anti-competitive and held a monopoly on a technology and service that no other telecom company could do.>\"Unfortunately, the Thatcher government decided that it wanted the American cable companies providing the same service to increase competition. So the decision was made to close down the local loop roll out and in 1991 that roll out was stopped. The two factories that BT had built to build fibre related components were sold to Fujitsu and HP, the assets were stripped and the expertise was shipped out to South East Asia.>\"Our colleagues in Korea and Japan, who were working with quite closely at the time, stood back and looked at what happened to us in amazement. What was pivotal was that they carried on with their respective fibre rollouts. And, well, the rest is history as they say.>\"What is quite astonishing is that a very similar thing happened in the United States. The US, UK and Japan were leading the world. In the US, a judge was appointed by Congress to break up AT&T.

Here's how charge out rate work.First, you need to find out average flat labour rate. Let's say you have 10 employees. 6 linesman paid at 40 bucks an hour straight time. 2 office workers at 20 bucks an hour, a foreman at 50 bucks an hour and an electrical engineer at 80 bucks an hour.   You add up all their wages and divide by the quantity. So, (6x40) +(2x20) +(50) +(80) = 410/10 = average labour cost of 41.00But that is just wages, and these lucky ducks also have medical coverage and a pension, each of which for simplicity sake is valued at 20.00 a person.Bid cost is now up to 61/hourBut the workers were brought in from outside their home, so they need somewhere to sleep! The secretaries and engineers don't so we save a few bucks. Hotels are running 168 bucks a night right now due to a hurricane frigging things up. 166/8 hours is an extra 21 bucks an hour for 7 of your workforce. 64 bucks now, still not bad.But now you need a machine for your guys to get to the polls. Let's say you have 3 teams of 2 guys and a Truck on the road and the super gets his truck paid for.  You're renting 3 cherry pickers and a new 2017 f150. Well the pickers are a 1000 bucks a day after insurance and the truck is 100. Well, 3100 a day divided by the hours your using them can increase your rate by 412.50 bucks,Bringing us to... wow 476.50! Not to mention your employees are just working 8 hour days! Theres a push, better get the lead out!If the linesmen, foreman and super work 12s, at 1.5x for OT, you need more math.(40x8) + (60x4) / 12 = an adjusted linesman rate of 47. (50x8) + (75x4) / 12 = and adjusted foreman rate of 59(80x8) + (120x4) /12 = 94Let's punch that into our earlier labour calculator(6x47) +(2x20) +(59) +(94) = 475/1047.5, a difference of 6.50 an hour 483 an hour is where are at now. (We don't pay trucks overtime!). We still need to pay workers comp, insurance on the contract, cover tools and consumable, materials and our profit.  This is getting expensive to hire a linesman isn't it?Materials may be supplied by the energy utility as are consumables. We still need that tool allowance which bumps our bid up by 5 bucks an hour. Our profit is 5% on top of that, and insurance 10% of the whole pie at the end. We are now at 563.64 on the bottom line of our bid for hourly cost, even though the linesmen are only getting paid at 60 bucks on their OT. But its just hit the news, so we probably lost the contract and people think we are skimming. Too bad we had to rent 3 cherry pickers on an storm ravaged island! You could have done the job for 161 bucks an hour otherwise.TLDR; Without the submitted bid to see what was involved in the contract, there is no need for this bid to be suspect. We would need to see the low bid of just electricians and compare to what they need to cover to rebuild the island.

Well it would have to be ours.That means a tax increase.The government is shaky as it is.  There's no way that they will increase taxes any time soon.They wont do it for the NHS and they wont do it for housing.We're about to be hit by further economic woe's when everyone realises that we're not going to get a deal from Europe that works in our favour.We will see less growth, higher living costs and less pay rises.This housing crisis is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.What can the government do?  Not very much.What will the government do?  Nothing.So that means if you're worried about this issue and the people who are homeless...  Then you as an individual should help them.

Every case should be fairly and equally investigated.2. People are innocent until proven guilty. Many people are commenting some form of, \"so sad that our society doesn't treat sexual harrassment and assault seriously,\" which may carry some weight, but likewise you cant assume every accusation and statement is true at face value. You can't make these alledged perpatrators automatic monsters without also giving them fair chance and let the investigation play out. Which goes back to point one, let the investigation play out and it should be fair. 3. As I said before, sexual harassment and assault is very serious and no small matter. I'm not defending anyone or attacking anyone. But assuming accusations are automatically true is just as unfair as assuming they aren't. Just because I believe the claims need investigated, doesn't mean I don't respect women or understand the severity of sexual harassment and assault.

Focusing on her is ignoring the bigger picture in favor of a western focused individual narrative, which is a poor method of interpretation when dealing with an Asian, majority-Buddhist country.  Suu Kyi is ultimately just a convenient scapegoat for the real power in Myanmar; it's military, a role she has interestingly played for her entire life in some form or another.What really happened 7-8 years ago when the Junta seemingly gave up power is that the military leaders started using western PR strategies to end their long isolation.  During the transitional period they put up this long fight with Suu Kyi, and got her to concede on numerous fronts so that when she ultimately became the head of state she had zero control over the military and the country's security policies.  While the rest of the world was overjoyed at Myanmar's return to normal civilian rule, the military leadership was taking advantage of the easement of sanctions to modernize and build up their forces, and ultimately used that to end the long stalemate for control of the Rohingya majority provinces.  It was an ingenious strategic move, and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if the money grubbing vampire squids of Wall and K street played a major part in this.
