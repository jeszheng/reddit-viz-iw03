Get all the gun control you want, you'll never stop criminals from having illegal access to weapons, and by adding more gun laws, you're only going to affect law-abiding citizens from being able to practice castle doctrine and protect their families. The other problem that I have is the solution to the wrong problem. Gun control is not the answer to stopping deranged metal people from committing mass shootings. We need to seriously address mental issues instead of making it about guns. Any person can buy a gun, but it takes a seriously unstable person to shower over 1000+ people with bullets. Normal people just don't do that, and by taking away the gun, you're no step closer to solving their personal issue (aka, the danger is still out there). Any person can literally go to Home Depot, buy a nail gun and cause the same amount of damage as a gun would, without an ID. All it takes the damaged mind to use a weapon, let it be a pistol, nail gun, saw, knife or rubber duckie.Thirdly, there are more guns in American households than Americans themselves. And in almost every mass shooting in American history, there seems to be some sort of emotional and mental relation to it. Normal, law-abiding citizens have respect and proper handling of weapons because they KNOW what they invested in. With so many guns in so many peoples' hands, you'd expect a bloodbath beyond your imagination. But there isn't, and will never be. Taking away a weapon from a protective father, or a hunter, or a collector, or an officer is a recipe for disaster. A murderous sociopath will just commit his/her murders using a different weapon, it won't change a thing, unless you address and tackle their mental instabilities. That is my concern, wasting time and resources tackling the wrong issue with a wrong solution that will only affect those who abide by the law itselfBut we all know how this is gonna go. It's another Sandy Hook or Columbine gun debate:- Liberals/Democrats: Guns are the problem. It's the gun's fault, we need to ban guns because guns kill people- Conservatives/Republicans: The whole thing was staged. The government made this up to justify banning our guns.Edit: Guys, I don't advocate some random Joe owning an assault rifle or a bazooka or flamethrower. When gun control is usually mentioned in America, it usually means outright banning of weapons. That's what I'm talking out, full-out banning of guns.

For that I had to fill out the proper paperwork with my local police, and provide them a photocopy of my drivers license. By state law unless your local police have a reason to disqualify you, it gets granted 7-10 days later. Once I found the gun I wanted, I went to the FFL and ran a background check on me. I built my AR-15 myself, and under current law, the part that's regulated like a gun is the lower receiver. When I bought mine I had to ship it to a local FFL to perform the transfer (for a fee), but all of the parts that go around the lower receiver I could ship directly to my house.

Without the license, you can't buy a gun.  Guns are serialized and tracked (like registering a car), and if your gun is found to have been used to commit a crime, you lose your ownership rights unless you've previously reported it stolen.  More than one stolen item incident and you also lose ownership rights.The license would require a firearms class, multiple ones which detail how to shoot, safe handling, shooting from holster, and more, so you'd be automatically eligible for CC.  Your safety instructor could at any time raise a red flag and potentially stop you from receiving a license (with ability to appeal).

Not a lot of people are too upset that their neighbors own guns, or that people use guns to hunt, or that people just enjoy using guns. To my knowledge, the main argument *against* the possession of firearms is their capability to incur large casualties before anyone has a chance to escape.The Las Vegas incident is a prime example of the argument, from many angles.From the limited amount of information I have on the incident, there was a lone shooter, so one gun. From what I saw/heard, it seemed to me to be a Light Machine Gun. It may have been something else, for instance a more standard assault rifle with an increased magazine capacity, but for the sake of the discussion lets just say it was an LMGSo the shooter has an LMG. And the question we're trying to answer is, what should we have done, and what can we do for the future, to prevent this sort of thing. The obvious answer to is try to take the LMG out of the hands of the shooter. Assuming we can't look into everyone's mind and determine whether they're going to try to go on a killing spree, this means we're going to have to take away *everyone's* LMGS.This runs into 2 problems. Which is really just one problem* Where do we draw the line on what should and shouldn't be illegal* Why shouldn't we just take all the gunsHere it may be helpful to review why people may be opposed to stricter gun laws. From my perspective, the arguments for gun ownership can be summed up with 2 points:1. We should allow people to have guns because they're useful for hunting/extermination of vermin and [other utility I couldn't think of here], and just in general fun to use.1. People should have guns so that in the event of the rise of an immoral government, the people have a chance of fighting back.The first argument I think bears the least relation to this discussion, because no one needs an LMG to go hunting, and I don't think anyone is going to prioritize the fun of shooting over the possibility of saving lives. That leaves the second argument. I believe this is the main point of friction in these discussions. It seems to me that one side wants to reduce losses at all cost, and one side wants to protect our future children from possible tyranny.

I also believe in shall issue concealed carry permits in all U.S. territories. A citizen of a free country deserves the right to defend themselves against a violent attacker. If we are talking strictly the purpose of the 2nd Amendment, it is there to allow the people of this nation to defend the country from a tyrannical government and/or a foreign invader. We can't do that with muskets and shit, we need firearms similar to those that would be used by a hostile occupying force. People seem to be inexplicably fearful of the AR15 AKA the dreaded black rifle. It is not \"high-powered\" it is regular powered and under powered in comparison to something like the previously mentioned Garands and hunting rifles. The media doesn't help when they only report when someone has been unlawfully shot but hardly ever report on the numerous people who use firearms to effectively defend themselves or others. I also believe things like the California Hand Gun Roster is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to keep poor people from accessing firearms, every single firearm on that roster cost more than $400. I have no problem with things like background checks, licences and even waiting periods but arbitrary restrictions on things like what kind of guns are allowed, what features are allowed on rifles, and restricting ammo sales don't protect anyone. Most importantly these kinds of draconian laws don't reduce violent crime and only serve to propagate illegal trade operations. *cough cough* Leeland Yee *cough cough* I guess my point is this particular debate is a waste of time considering last I checked something like 48% of the country owns at least one gun. Not only that it takes away from things that actually need to get done like the sky rocketing homeless population, lead in our drinking water, affordable healthcare, the impeding nuclear winter and disastrous climate change.

Here are a few thoughts on the Second Amendment which is:*A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.*(NOTE: the framers proposed the same text with a comma after Militia and a comma after Arms - a subject of much debate over the years, but the text above was ratified and is law).- My opinion is that the intention behind the specific text of the amendment was quite obviously specific to a \"Militia\", which has a very exact definition and 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms' was only with respect to a militia. However, that debate was lost a long time ago, so I won't even go down that path.- The amendment was formed during the infancy of firearms, therefore it gave no considerations to the weaponry of modern times.- We could (and should) stick to its original definition of 'Arms' - which would have been single action firearms. That's all that is required to take a huge leap forward in with respect to gun control. It is somewhat similar to what Australia enacted decades ago and has been successful - please don't listen to anyone arguing it's lack of success, they are lying or mistaken. Unfortunately, there are a ton of \"articles\" out there that argue the success of this law, but my feeling is they were politically motivated.  - If we did enact a law like the Aussies, it would cost us billions in gun buy backs, not to mention a great deal of violence in the process of collecting illegal firearms. However, I feel it's necessary and the cost could be easily derived from a less than 1% cut of the national defense budget.- No, regarding the ability for a citizenry to rise up and overthrow their government, which is a big counter argument 2nd Amendment supporters raise - I just feel like that's not how it's going to happen in today's day and age. It doesn't matter how many AR's you have, you're not going to be match for a targeted drone strike and if the federal government is coming for you, they're going to get you. This concept itself needs to evolve. No one's overthrowing the US Government with any \"Arms\" referenced to in the constitution. It would be like bringing a slingshot to a flamethrower fight - actually, that be a 100 times more fair of a fight.- Many would argue guns are too much a part of our history at this point, and this is a big factor, Americans *love, love, love* their guns. It's a problem, perhaps the biggest one in this whole debate, it would take a long time, but it ultimately has to happen.To answer the original question, I would simply change the current text to:*The right of the people to bear arms shall be limited to >insert simple categories that allow for single shot firearms for hunting or self defense, etc.<. The categories referenced herein shall be necessarily evaluated every twenty years to determine if such assignments had become antiquated.*FINAL NOTE: I'm not an expert on guns or the specifics of what determines automatic weapons or weaponry that is deemed valid for home defense and hunting. I realize this is a very contentious issue, so I'd ask for respect of what merely amounts to my opinion. And for anyone curious about the categories in question, I would use the Australian law I referenced earlier as a guide, it may not be perfect, but it's a start.

As it has been brought up by others in this thread, retinoscopy (streak) is the definitive (currently) way optometrists and ophthalmologists calculate prescriptions in cases where verbal communication is not possible, i.e. babies, infants, young children, mentally challenged or elderly patients. Retinoscopy works by shinning a retinscope into a patient's eye and observing the reflex of light that is reflected back. This system is built on the optics found in the eye, no different to the optics of a camera lens. There are two movements we expect to see, they are an against or with movement. An against movement means you need a negative lens correct (myopia) and a with movement means you need a positive lens to correct (hyperopia). You can also calculate astigmastism with retinoscopy, and this is where it becomes difficult. In the hands of a capable operator, retinoscopy is far more accurate than any modern autorefractor (for now) as operators have trained many years to use a retinoscope. The problem with current auto-refractors is that they do not account for accommodation in the eye; think when you switch between looking at something far away like the horizon and then looking at your phone quickly. Do you sometimes notice it takes a microsecond or two to adjust? Thats your accommodation working, your eye lens physically changes shape in order for you to see your phone clearly; think chaning focal lenghts on a camera zoom. Accommodation breaks down around 40years old progressively until around 60 and this is why people need reading glasses. I digress.

Speaking as a pre-registration optometrist in England I will try and explain why this is the case as best i can.Subjective results are generally better because we must control a process we call \"accommodation\"  i.e. the ability young individuals have to focus for near. Optics 101 also shows that you can use this additional focusing power to focus through some prescriptions, for example \"long sighted\" or plus prescriptions, this causes long term issues in patients because this requires effort and causes eyestrain. In children the ability to accommodate is very high. Trust me when I say it is much easier to relax this accommodation in someone who a.) Has less ability to do it and b.) Can understand subjectively when a lens makes no difference to their sight. These are both adult qualities, as a result we must do it differently for children. The way we generally do it is by relaxing the accommodation with drops called cycloplegics, these drugs then have side effects which then make subjective testing EVEN harder. For example it makes your pupils larger which can then cause glare which could be mistaken for blur. We must then use objective methods to determine a rough estimate of the prescription because the patient cannot operate subjectively, it is by no means more accurate. BUT that's not to say it is going to damage your child's sight, we tend to give these prescriptions simply to relax the child's eye muscles and allow for NORMAL ocular development. Normal ocular development shows that children tend to be slightly long sighted and become more short sighted until they have no prescription, this is normal because the larger your eye the more short sighted you become. It's obviously normal for your eyes to become larger as the body gets bigger. This is why we only correct gross long sightedness (we rarely intervene with short sightedness because glasses may not help much, specialist CLs are generally used for these children). As you can probably deduce now, it does not matter if we leave the child slightly long sighted because they have a large amount of accommodation, so the fact our prescriptions will be slightly off when obtained objectively (which they will be) will not be an issue. It's all about reducing the amount of long sightedness to a point which will not cause the patient to accommodate TOO much, which will then cause eyestrain and even lazy eyes (accommodation also stimulates the eyes to turn in as well). Lazy eyes are the worst case scenario in children undergoing ocular development, because the brain is still malleable or \"plastic\". Therefore, it can develop to IGNORE the visual information being sent by the lazy eye (therefore, the brain is avoiding double vision and blur) and cause very reduced vision in that eye in later life. In my experience, I generally prescribe long sighted prescriptions causing problems (for example lazy eyes) then use further tests to monitor whether the prescription has removed the lazy eye at future visits. I refer short sighted/ different prescriptions in each eye (anisometropia) to specialists to fit contact lenses etc. Some children also need patching to remove this dominance issue which is undertaken by other specialists. TLDR: we generally prescribe children to relax their \"accommodation\" to the point where it doesn't cause them any issues (lazy eyes/eyestrain). The long sighted child will see fine regardless of if a prescription is in place or not because their ability to accommodate through long sighted prescriptions is so good. Objective methods are not superior but are our only alternative. Prescribing for short sighted children or children with prescriptions which are different in each eye are more complex and require contact lens intervention. We prescribe for those children to slow the progression of short sightedness or to make the images formed by each eye more equal. Again, having the exact right prescription may not be possible for these children without subjective methods but we definitely allow the children's ocular development to be less affected by their incorrect prescription. The goal in prescribing for children is usually not to let them see clearly but to improve their ocular development.Phew, that's hard to explain in layman's terms.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 16, "stickied": false, "score": 13, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  2 16:16:53 2017", "ups": 13}, {"body": "There are two ways that I know of, one being retinoscopy, and other being teller cards.

I'll do my best to answer your question, but disclaimer, I only know the capabilities of the NSA as of a few years ago (Snowden leaks). They may have new toys since then that defeat these methods, but these are good guesses. I'm taking this as seriously as I can, assuming the threat is even greater than I know.1) Buy all hardware locally and at once. Computer, router, even the monitor and cables, all new, all local, all today. This may sound counterintuitive, but unless your system is already pwned, it's pretty hard to identify hardware serials or something over the internet. What you should *really* be afraid of is that [entities like the NSA are known to intercept mail to 'persons of interest' to install hardware bugs](https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/29/5253226/nsa-cia-fbi-laptop-usb-plant-spy). They (probably) can't bug every single device in your local stores, so you get the best chance suddenly buying local, all at once.2) Buy AMD, not Intel. I haven't seen any obvious evidence of backdoors in AMD processors, but [Intel's suspicious AMT and microcode have already had several demonstrated vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#Known_vulnerabilities_and_exploits). You really don't want them to get root on your CPU microcode somehow.3) Install Linux immediately. The last thing you need is a backdoor in Windows or [bundled vendor crapware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfish#Lenovo_security_incident) to give you away. For slightly better odds, don't use any non-free packages (binaries) you can avoid.4) I hope you used full-drive encryption on that Linux install, just in case.5) Get Tor. The current version. Immediately. The more you do online without it, the more of a profile they'll have on you. Even looking for Tor may be suspicious, if they find out somehow. I'd see if you can download it with a USB stick and a local library, preferably a lazy one that doesn't have the computer validate your library card. Tor isn't perfect, but it's a huge pain to compromise you entirely through it, even for governments, as far as we know. You won't be using it unshielded for too long, though. Don't do anything to garner attention yet.6) Don't write like you. Deliberately misspell things you spell correctly, change how you capitalize, how long your sentences are, how you use punctuation. Be very aware that you may be using local or national slang that could identify you. Turns out [many things about your usual writing style may be identifiable](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/why-hackers-should-be-afraid-of-how-they-write-20130115-2csdo).7) I hope you grabbed some good hardware, because it's time to mine cryptocurrencies, preferably Monero at the time of writing. Buying them might leave a trail, but if you set up your miner through Tor and use an anonymous wallet, it would be damn near impossible to know you did it. We'll be using these to fund further excursions.8) Time to go to the darknet. Use your mined cryptocurrency to rent a server somewhere uncooperative to the government you're most afraid of, Russian if you're after the US, etc. Make sure you'll be able to install VPN software on it: I recommend OpenVPN or CJDNS-Tunnel, but a lot of OpenVZ boxes can't install tunnels without an extra module being enabled, for example. Linux only, obviously, preferably very up-to-date.9) Enjoy! This is most all you can do, and it should be resistent. Through Tor, connect to your new VPN box. Now you have an IP address that isn't obviously a Tor node, and any logs of your traffic will be in a country your opponents won't be able to subpoena. Make sure you stop paying your bill on that server occasionally and pick a new one, to make it a pain to build a pattern or hack your VPN exits to get to you.Again, though, I should stress: **This is a best guess, presented for educational purposes only.** I know these fields, but governments have staggering resources and talent.

I hated my exes fingering me, it did nothing for me. But my current boyfriend figured it out. It's pretty fun. Showing him how I liked it, and really letting go and enjoying what he was doing, even when it didn't really get me anywhere to start with seemed to help a lot. Lube also was really effective! Changed how it felt like a _lot_ for me. And then boom, it just worked one time. Never thought that was gonna happen. :) Worked more times after that too, so wasn't a one off (that I was afraid it would be). I never fake. I don't fake pleasure either. But I know moving my body helps trigger good feelings, so I will move, or mm if something feels extra good. But your man is _never_ gonna learn if you aren't honest with him. Just say that this is something no one ever managed before, and you don't think it can happen, but he's welcome to try. And if he enjoys trying, even if you don't come (which mine did!), then just treat it as a massage or something. Don't aim to come, but aim to enjoy. If it does nothing, perhaps lube helps. If that does nothing, perhaps some other time will be better. I'm not always sensitive, it varies a lot. As for PIV... I'm absolutely convinced I can't come from PIV alone. I've tried so many times on my own. Can't do it. Been close, but still need clit stimulation to come, even if it's just a feather light touch. So I just rub myself when we have sex, works for me.

I\u2019d like to share why I made this decision because if I think women need to make fully informed decisions about what happens to their bodies. And please understand, this is NOT a critique plastic surgery or implants--they were just totally wrong for me and I hoping someone can learn from it. Then, it at least wasn't for nothing. I got my implants 10 years ago when I was 20 years old. Submuscular. Saline. I went from a 32A or B to a 32DD. I\u2019m 5\u20191 and about 110lbs (on a good day). At that time, a popular TV show was Nip/Tuck (an FX drama about a Miami plastic surgery practice). And the characters would always start a consultation by saying \u201ctell me what you don\u2019t like about yourself.\u201d 10 years ago, I could have written an entire book attempting to answer that question--there wasn't much that I did like about myself. Least of all, was my body: I HATED it as most women are, unfortunately, conditioned to do, starting at a very young age. I had also spent some of my teenage years being overweight (gotta love that \u2018Mercian diet) and I couldn't stop seeing myself that way, no matter how much weight I lost. But then when I was FINALLY thin enough, I thought my boobs had become too small. Never mind that I'm petite and 5\u20191 and was born to have tiny (but perky!) lil boobies. And, evolutionary biology studies have shown that what actually makes breasts attractive is the perkiness, NOT the size. Those were (obviously) not factors in my decision. Nevertheless, at first I really did enjoy all of the extra attention I got when my boobs were small-melon/large grapefruit-sized. But, as time went on, I realized I really don't want *that* kind of attention. Sometimes, I just want to go to a bar and be left the fuck alone. I don't like being stared at, I'd rather someone try to make eye contact with me, so the staring can at least be mutual. That thought had never once crossed my mind. I also failed to consider how difficult it would be for me to find bras--I have teeny tiny shoulders and my chest boulders needed to be supported against gravity but I rarely found a size 32DD bra with short enough straps. Having your bra strap continually slide off your shoulder is SO annoying, especially when it's for 10 goddamn years. And, I didn't think about the consequences it would have on my body. The extra weight made it more difficult for me to sit up straight and I've noticed gradually worsening back pain over the years. I also just feel like it's so much easier to breathe without that weight. Every time I gave someone a hug, I could  feel them in between me and the person I am hugging, it's kind of sad feeling like you can never get hugged as hard or as closely as you would like. I'm also a stomach sleeper for at least some of the night and when I had implants, I'd often wake up because it was uncomfortable. Every time I would lie on my back, they\u2019d drift down to the sides into my armpits-they didn\u2019t even look like boobs anymore when I was laying down--they looked more like weird armpit tumors. When I was upright, they caused a very deep divot in my armpit making it very difficult to shave without cutting myself. Ever done that without realizing it and put on deodorant? It's unforgettable. Also, when I was sweaty and I would move my arms, my armpits would make involuntarily armpit fart-noises. And think about the things you do that make you sweat. Yeah. That's. Totally. Attractive. When I\u2019d go an hour without wearing a bra, I was sore. I LOVE not having to wear a bra all the time anymore. When I would do yoga there were certain positions where they wound up right in my face and I felt like I couldn\u2019t really breathe, which is something you're kinda supposed to in yoga. Despite my practice of yoga, I'm not the most graceful human, so sometimes, when I ate, food would fall down my cleavage and I wouldn\u2019t find it until the end of the day when I changed into my pajamas. There were rare instances when I found something intact and delicious, like an M+M, but most of the time, it was just disgusting. When I had sex, I\u2019d have to explain to men why my breasts look and feel weird and overly firm and that it kind of hurts if they're touched a certain way (so please don't). Fantastic foreplay. Before, when I had my implants, my nipples felt cold more (I think because they were further away from my body) but now, they actually get warm and they're not irritated. Breast cancer runs in my family. So in 10 years, when I need a mammogram, the implants would have made it more difficult to detect cancer, not to mention way more painful. Not worth risking my life, even if it's a small risk. Implants also require maintenance, which means surgery every 10-15 years (20 if you're lucky), and more often if there are complications (such as capsular contracture). I never thought of any of that when I decided to get implants. And, surgery, is NOT cheap. That being said, it's one of the best things I've done for myself.

I'm looking for advice if you have any,This morning I was finishing up work when two women came in and sat down next to me. For context, they were black women and I am a white women.They were talking loudly enough for me to hear, and were discussing the shooting that has just taken place in Las Vegas. They were discussing the shooter, and a lot of the discussion revolved around race and the media. Soon after they arrived, I began packing up to leave. The women assumed I was leaving was because of their discussion. They started whispering about me, calling me an ignorant white women. They said I refused to acknowledge the truth and it was white privilege that allows me to do so. I don't think they intended for me to hear this. I honestly strained to listen because I could tell they were talking about me.On one hand, I get that they've probably dealt with a lot of stuff like this in their lives that I can't even imagine. Being a black person in America is obviously much more difficult than being a white person, and maybe what they assumed I was doing was something that has happened before. I can't put myself in their shoes.On the other hand, it was really upsetting to have those assumptions put on me. I hate that they assumed I was some racist, bigoted individual just because I'm a white women who happened to be leaving the shop as they were having the conversation. I also felt as if I was put in a situation where I couldn't defend myself. Obviously I didn't want to start a public altercation with strangers, but also anything I said to defend myself would come across as defensive and reactionary. I left without saying anything, but this interaction is still weighing on my shoulders later in the day.

There is no legitimate reason semi auto, hi cap rifles like an AR-15 should be legal for civilians. Aside from recreation, they serve no purpose other guns couldnt fill. you dont carry a long gun as your every day carry and home defense can be accomplished with a handgun or shotgun. the only difference is that these rifles are much better at shooting off many more rounds, much faster- which is something no civilian should ever need. And while i think we can all agree guns are fun to shoot, a hobby this dangerous needs to be restricted. I'm not saying we should ban all guns. I'm saying we should move semi auto rifles like AR15s into a more controlled category. maybe the same category as machine guns, which are extremely hard to get. This obv wont stop mass shootings since handguns can be just as deadly, but i see no downside and anything that would make a shooting like this less successful is a good thing. and yes, we need to have better mental health treatment but that can be nearly impossible to find and treat. finding these people before would be ideal but also extremely hard, so regulating the guns they use seems like a better option. Also, yes, criminals will likely still get guns from mexico or something, but gang members arent usually the ones involved in mass shootings of innocent civilians. most mass killings are done with legal weapons anyways. *the police reports are of a semi auto rifle. he was likely using an AR with bump fire, as shown by [fps russia here](https://youtu.be/I6BFarrICWs?t=53s), which allow you to shoot as fast as the videos were showing.

If we are to start to simply follow whatever people call themselves  despite our personal feelings on the matter.    There are two real concerns I have the second may some absurd but it's actually happened to me.1.  There are so many variations of preferred pro-nouns already how can we even be expected to remember them all let alone who they are and aren't associated with?    This growing trend may have popularly used ones but I've noticed more and more people just making up their own.     It's going to become impossible to get right even for die hard supporters of this.2.   What of the absurdities?   I have met not  one, two, or three but four people who have claimed their gender is angel/angelic.   You read that right angel.   These four were all separate occasions none even claimed to be otherkin or anything of the sort.    All claimed to be angels in gender and expected people to refer and respect them as such.Now, what am I suppose to do in that situation?   If I deny their divinity  and accept Xer,  shkle,  (yes really)  than I am special pleading for Xer, shkle, and others that are on my personal approved list.     I have no evidence based reason to accept that Shelly is a Xer anymore than Robert is a angel.So what exactly is even a liberal minded person like myself to do?  I don't want to be a asshole  but I can't give special  treatment to some and deny others the same.   I most certainly cannot reasonably be expected to accept them all including the insane ones like the angelic gender claimers.    This isn't even a slippery slope position I am taking as I've already encountered what is at the end of the slope.
