I was traveling via train with my fiance from my home town back to my current residence when I feel the bloat come on. I'm uncomfortable, but nowhere near the kind of pain needed to use a commercial transit bathroom, you know?After some time and some tactical SBD farts (sorry honey) to relieve pressure I'm starting to think I'll make it home without the need to make poo-poo on a choo-choo. I take some Pepto-Bismol and go to sleep.I wake up in the tunnels entering my city. I'm so groggy from the long weekend of partying and eating badly but the urge to purge is gnawing at my mind. I can't make it home. I have to commit myself to this bathroom before this train makes it to the station, which takes like 10 minutes from the time I wake up.I make my way to the bathrooms. One's occupied, no biggie, I'll just use the other one, right? WRONG! This thing is already a fucking disaster. There is literal anal spray everywhere from the seat down to the floor. My stomach becomes more insistent.You can do this!, I tell myself. My stomach makes sounds like a whale with Downs. I have to do this.Now for those who don't know, riding a train? Not smooth. You practically need fucking sea legs when these things are in motion. This particular train line sometimes makes a handful of short stops along the way for track changes. Do you see where this is going?I drop my pants. I grab the hand-helper rail and the sink to support myself and hover over the shit-caked john. I go to let loose. The train stops suddenly. The turd hits the seat. All of it you guys. \"Fuck\" I mutter to myself. Now it's around this time I notice the worst part....The door is open.*Wide.**Fucking.***Open.**I panic. The people in the front row definitely saw. I hear them cackling madly. I run up and close the door blood pounding in my ears from embarrassment. In my haste I get poo on my sneaker. Is it mine? Who fucking knows, there's shit everywhere in this stinking box I've now trapped myself within. I panic again. I can't go out there now. They've seen me in my most vulnerable moment! THEY SAW ME MISS THE SEAT!I start to get my shit together (HA!), mentally. I start texting my fianc\u00e9 in a flurry. I tell her what happened in some detail. I tell her to grab the bags. That I need to wait for this train to clear out, I CAN'T BE SEEN!Did you think the embarrassment is over guys? It isn't.I started to notice something weird about my text thread. There's two recipients. I chose the thread my fianc\u00e9 and I used to text my dad on his birthday. I just told my dad this entire story. She's calling. He's calling. I'm dying inside. I don't answer.I feel the train come to a stop. The smell and emotional trauma are making me woozy. I wait until everyone else leaves the train and sneak out of the bathroom and then the train. I see my fianc\u00e9 there flushed with laughter, tears rolling down her face like some hysterical maniac. I tell her to take me home, feeling like I just lost my will to live. I beg my dad to never mention it again. What comes up every time I visit now?You fucking guessed it.TL;DR: Stomach trouble on a stop and go train ride, forgot to close the door.

Then I heard a high-pitched, womanly cough - maybe a gag reflex? - which was definitely my fault, I knew. Suddenly I began replaying the last few minutes in my mind: *did I see urinals when I walked in?*Thankfully, the lady next to men was quick about her business, flushed and skedaddled.  I hurried up and finished, trying to bolt before the next person came in. But then another person came in. Then another.  There were a couple women by the sink conversing and then I *knew* I was in the wrong bathroom.  I began to sweat. There I was, pants down in a women's restroom....could that be considered a sex crime?  Would they I say I had some sort of pooping-in-the-presence-of-women fetish? How was I going to explain this to my wife?  And how the hell were they still breathing after the stink bomb I dropped?When the voices faded and I was sure I was alone, I quickly finished up and bolted.  Sure enough, there were no urinals on the way out.

Food, housing, and childcare can vary massively, but each has a floor and most have a \"reasonability\" ceiling.

You can't reasonably have transportation (to work) for less than $50 a month. That is $9000 or 50% of the poor person's take home pay after 10% taxes only on food, housing and transportation.  In order to be in the same position, the rich person would need to spend $900,000 a year on the same.  And while Whole Foods may be \"whole paycheck\", a rich person does not reasonably spend 100 times what the poor person does on the basics.  So while that $200,000 is 10% of rich person's, the same as the $2000 is 10% of the poor person's income, it is a substantially lower percentage of their necessary expenditures, even accounting for \"fancy\" or \"luxury markups.

The problem is achieving orbit; and that means you have to be travelling fast enough that even though gravity is still pulling you down, you're going [sideways fast enough that you miss](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjQvejln-bWAhVEIlAKHbO6CggQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcse.ssl.berkeley.edu%2Fbmendez%2Fay10%2F2002%2Fnotes%2Flec7.html&psig=AOvVaw2fru2DIXwGDNBwj8xKzMu4&ust=1507731496354842).So a rocket needs a massive amount of fuel because it has to go really *really* fast (between 7 and 8 km per second for low earth orbit). So rather than taking off sideways, and having to fight through all that dense atmosphere, the best thing for a rocket to do is get up and out of the dense bit of the atmosphere as quickly as possible, then start tilting over to try and gain that orbital velocity.

Either way, there are a lot of challenges in feeding those plants. We proposed using composters to recycle human waste to make the system fully sustainable, as plants \"breathe\" pure water out which could then be utilized as drinking water as well. I don't know all the details about that part of it, as that wasn't my section. We also intended to use Fresnel lenses with fiber optic cables to deliver sunlight directly to the plants, with blue and red LEDs as a backup (it'd be placed underground because the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris).Unfortunately, hydroponics would have difficulty in a low gravity environment like the ISS without some real specialized design, which the plants may not like.

Short answer is yes, but not infinite and not without disadvantages.Note that plants aren't the only way to recycle oxygen. Currently they use water electrolysis to inject oxygen into their atmosphere, and use the resulting hydrogen to apply the Sabatier reaction with CO2. This yields methane as a waste product, and captures oxygen from CO2 in the form of water, so they can later apply electrolysis again and recycle oxygen.A clear advantage of using plants would be trapping carbon into edible forms, so you'd be recycling not only oxygen but also food. However, not all plants have a 100% edible mass, and those who do usually offer very few calories if not negligible (e.g. lettuce).A problem with plants is that they could die under some conditions, so this system isn't 100% reliable.

Consider for instance the reaction of moving an electron from a sodium atom to a chlorine atom: Na + Cl --> Na^+ + Cl^- . From what most of us learned in grade school that the right-hand side of that equation has filled shells, so it is more stable. It is not. Two _isolated ions_ by themselves in a vacuum are not stable compared to the neutral atoms. (The ionization energy of sodium is 496 kJ/mol and the electron affinity of chlorine is -349 kJ/mol, so you're short 150 kJ/mol). It's _in water solution_ that the two ions are stable, thanks to the additional stabilizing interaction with the water molecules. As a rule, the neutral form of a pair of atoms/molecules is almost always more stable than an oxidized/reduced pair, even if they get to have filled shells. It's only when you form an ionic bond or a introduce a stabilizing solute that ions become stable. So there are a lot of competing effects here. Just from a Coulomb's Law guesstimate, it clearly should require twice as much energy to remove a second electron from a positively-charged ion, three times as much to remove the third. (This assumes the electrons have the same energy other than the potential charge from the nucleus) Now look at the first three ionization energies for the [nitrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen). They're 1402, 2856, 4578 kJ/mol. So this shows that it actually follows that trend, roughly. But only that far - the fourth ionization energy is 7475. This goes for them all, for instance Magnesium: 738, 1451, 7733 kJ/mol. As soon as you start pulling electrons out of a lower shell, there's a dramatic jump in the amount of energy required. Which is to be expected, since those electrons have a different amount of energy entirely. It works the same way for the electron affinity. If acquiring another electron requires moving it into a higher shell, the affinity (amount of energy en electron loses by being added to the atom, relative a free electron) will be significantly lower.Now, you're not wrong in pointing out that the electronic repulsion increases. It does. However, you're overestimating its effects. Consider Helium for instance. The ground-state electron energy of a [hydrogen-like atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-like_atom), in Hartree units, is -Z^(2)/2. Which means the H ground state is -1/2 Hartrees, and the He^+ ground state is 2^(2)/2 = -2 Hartrees. Now introduce a second electron that _doesn't repel the first one at all_ and the ground state energy for your two non-interacting electrons is simply twice that, or -4 Hartrees. The [actual ground state](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0605018) energy is -2.903... So the electron-electron repulsion is indeed quite significant, increasing the ground-state energy by 27% compared to fictional noninteracting electrons.However, this is once again making the 'mistake' of looking at the absolute numbers and the energies as compared to a free electron.  Again in these 'stability' discussions you're interested in the _relative_ quantities, so the amount of e-e repulsion you're interested in is really the relative amount of repulsion in the orbital an electron is leaving relative the orbital the it's entering. Now when you consider electrons in different orbitals in the same subshell (px vs py vs pz for instance), then those orbitals don't actually overlap that much more than any other ones. And all else being equal, electrons should and do ( per [Hund's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hund%27s_rule_of_maximum_multiplicity)) first spread out evenly to minimize e-e repulsion^*. Filling a complete shell or half-shell, however, gives spherical symmetry and increases the effective nuclear charge per electron (Uns\u00f6ld's Theorem), lowering the energy and making filled (and half-filled) shells particularly stable. You can see these things compete in the copper-silver-gold group of metals, where one of the formerly lower-lying s-orbital electrons is promoted up to fill the d-shell, because the gain of closing the d shell is relatively great while the electron repulsion is relatively high in the s shell.So in short, there are many competing things going on and it's, to say the least, rather complicated to explain. (\\* Wikipedia and Levine's book claim that Hund's rule isn't because of e-e repulsion and was only formerly believed to be so.

We definitely see both of these circumstances in the ED.However, the more common circumstance is children refusing medication because of the taste.  It is not common to develop drugs that really taste good ... usually the effort is to prevent them from tasting awful.  A substantial percentage of emergency visits in our centre are from children who won't take their pain meds, or won't take their antibiotics.  And while the nurses can almost always get the meds into these little ones in the ED, many parents don't have that skill set for home.So:  I have not read a professional body consensus on this that is clear ... however it would seem to make sense to work on this problem by a) limiting access to ALL medications (and cigarettes, and street drugs) to kids.  Many of us will advise getting a fishing kit and a combination lock, and putting ALL medications (and your smokes!) in there.  Putting them up high doesn't work ... I have seen the two year old who climbed up the kitchen cupboards to get the \"candy\".b) ... we should work very hard to limit unnecessary medications.

I cannot remember specific names, but I'm sure we all recognize the ones I'm referring to from memory. Are these deliberately made gross to prevent self administration I have always wondered?So ...

We definitely see both of these circumstances in the ED.However, the more common circumstance is children refusing medication because of the taste.  It is not common to develop drugs that really taste good ... usually the effort is to prevent them from tasting awful.  A substantial percentage of emergency visits in our centre are from children who won't take their pain meds, or won't take their antibiotics.  And while the nurses can almost always get the meds into these little ones in the ED, many parents don't have that skill set for home.So:  I have not read a professional body consensus on this that is clear ... however it would seem to make sense to work on this problem by a) limiting access to ALL medications (and cigarettes, and street drugs) to kids.  Many of us will advise getting a fishing kit and a combination lock, and putting ALL medications (and your smokes!) in there.  Putting them up high doesn't work ... I have seen the two year old who climbed up the kitchen cupboards to get the \"candy\".b) ... we should work very hard to limit unnecessary medications.  Antibiotics for ear infections, for example ... a very common script but one for which there is very little support, scientifically.  And jeez don't get me started on antibiotics for the \"flu\".

This initiative is hugely important because:- there has never been a city-wide initiative like this before in Scotland (or in fact the UK).- events will include art exhibitions, seminars, conferences, film screenings, talks and workshops among others- events will be for everyone who wishes to be involved, from all communities and walks of life- discussions will include: sexual abuse/harassment; domestic abuse; mental health; female genital mutilation/cutting; child protection; forced marriage/child marriage; gender justice; slavery and human trafficking among others- most importantly, these events are being planned on a budget of exactly \u00a30. Partners have kindly contributed their own time/skills/energy/talent/resources in order for these event to take place, and the aim was that when men and women work together peacefully and collaboratively, great things can be achieved. Please take a moment to check our website: http://16days.org.uk/ and our blog: 16daysofempowerment.wordpress.com to see what is happening. Please post your (constructive) feedback and we look forward to hearing from you!", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "75jxpt", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Dear fellow feminists, I would like to let you know what is happening in Edinburgh, Scotland...", "num_comments": 0, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 2, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/75jxpt/dear_fellow_feminists_i_would_like_to_let_you/", "submission_time": "Wed Oct 11 00:32:38 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/75jxpt/dear_fellow_feminists_i_would_like_to_let_you/", "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "This is a link to a terrific article on 6 women who were snubbed.

It's a very common occurrance that among adults men are called \"men\" and women are called \"girls\". Why do people use a word that's meant to be used for female children when they talk about adult women? It even happens that \"man\" and \"girl\" are used in the same sentence when both persons that are being discussed are adults. At least to me it feels almost patronizing, as if a woman isn't adult enough to actually get called a woman, so she gets called a girl. And I know some people use it as a sort of endearing term, like the commong thing in movies where a charming man saying \"hi girls\" when he walks into a room and all the women sort of giggle and look coyly at him. But really, calling an adult a girl is a bit weird because the word girl carries with it some connotations, like na\u00efvety and childish innocence, that I wouldn't really see as suitable for a grown woman.Another similar thing I've noticed is that when talking about famous people, men are most often spoken about using their last name, while women are often spoken about using their first name. I've most often seen this in my studies (comparative literature) where many female authors are spoken of using their first name while for male authors their last names are used. Why is this? Personally I believe it's because there's a tendency to make men seem more professional, which using their last name enforces, and women are made to seem softer and more approachable, so their first names are used.While this are pretty small issues compared to things like violence and discrimination towards women, language does affect how we think and behave. And because of that it annoys me when grown women are called girls.

Back in the early days women were part of CS. You can look at computer magazines and books of the era and validate this. Boys and girls, men and women, played with computers. Black people are mostly missing here.Then video games became associated with computers, and then video games that were once targeted at boys and girls became gendered thanks to toys stores segregating toys by gender, and nintento buying into this. Video games became a boy thing; and with it computer became a boy thing. This plays out between 1986-1995ish... During this time video games and computers, and boys who use them, are made fun of. These things are toys, or they are for nerds, and all that kinda stuff.So when it came time for collage and CS, the girls in the class would be behind the boys; because their parents didnt by and large give them computers, and they didnt ask for them. With the boys being more advanced the girls quit because teachers didnt really understand what 101 is, and the boys might have been dicks. So girls and women started to disappear from the CS world. With no women role models, and the social stigmas, this just continued.In my experience here are a lot of women in CS around my age, the mid 40s, who got into computers in the late 70s and early 80s. I dont find many in their late 30s. Those I know are very unique women. Many of them the self starter I can learn it on my own kind./u/Idontpostmuchok's downvoted post shows you what CS types have to put up with as far as bigotry and assholism. Many people believe this kinda shit; and many women use things like this as venom against men. The lingering hatred of people who know things, the hatred of nerds and so on. Its much better now, but the effects linger, and people still love to invoke stereotypes that they dont get that also hurt women.... Many women look at CS as if only the unworthy should apply because of the narrative society has spewn all this time. The Hacker's Manifesto encouraged a generation... There needs to be a new women's perspective version to inspire women today.\" I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...                Or feels threatened by me...                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.\"These words empowered nerds of my generation. A middle finger to idiots... Women of today embrace flipping off the sexist status quo... CS and IT could really aid women here. And you dont need to pay to go to school for various fields, from systems, to networking, to programming all you need is the internet and a computer. People without degrees do get hired. NOCs and Helpdesks are great places to get your feet wet. Local computer clubs, like the 2600 meeting or maker meetings, are great communities to join and network from. These networks can help those without degrees or formal education link up with people who are concerned with skills and not pieces of paper. Too often people with certs turn out to be clueless. When I was a kid in the early 80s I knew as many girls with computers as I did boys. And we all pretty much typed in programs from the backs of magazines and learned basic to write our own stuff. I remember by my late teens a few girls who were into computers had been bullied out of it; not by boys; boys (at least those into computers) worshiped any girl with computer skills. Bullied by other girls, shamed for doing boy things.Sigh... I digress.

On our last night, we decided to go out, drink and have a little fun. While at a local bar that was right off the lake, we met a group of guys who were also on a friend's getaway weekend. One of the guys and I hit it off. We flirted, he bought me a couple of drinks and we danced together. At some point during the night, we went out to the beach that was connected to the bar. We started to make out for quite a while. There was touching both above and below the clothes, but that was it. To me, it was harmless and fun. After a while, we make it back to the bar and to our friends. We parted ways and my friends and I made it back to our condo. On the way home, I told my friends about my mini hook up with the new guy and two of my friends  instantly started to slut-shame me. I was completely shocked because my friends are typically fairly accepting of each other's sexual fun. It turns out that the group of guys were from a bachelor party, and I had just hooked up with the bachelor. I had no idea. My friends would not let it go, even though I told them I didn't know he was engaged. The guy never told me. However, according to my friends, I should have asked if he was single. Was I wrong to assume that someone is single if they are willing to make out with me? According to my friends, I should have known that he was taken. According to my friends, I am a homewrecker and that I could have potentially ruined a future marriage. Of course, they didn't blame the guy for being a complete cheater and creep. I told my friends that this is no way my fault or my problem that he guy wasn't honest with me. I scolded them for judging me. I think they finally understood that it wasn't my fault or my problem that the guy decided to cheat. They ended the conversation with a \"only God can judge us for our actions\" type of bullshit.

I understand and have accepted this, but I still do not wish for us to permanently go our separate ways. When do you all feel would be an appropriate time to approach her if at all? I\u2019m worried her family will call the police if I show up at their door, and she told her manager to escort me out if I show up at work although we had a very peaceful relationship and breakup process.. we never got into screaming matches or anything close to violent, so I don\u2019t understand where all of this hostility is coming from. We were living together over two years of our relationship, after her abusive mother crossed the line one night, and recently we move into an apartment together. But she just cut us off like we weren\u2019t even family.. my sister in law and her were like best friends, and she (my SIL) Believes she is just craving something new. I\u2019m sorry this post is all over the place I\u2019m very emotional right now. But do you all feel it would be appropriate for me to approach her somehow? Not now, but possibly in the near future?

And before anyone says I should have not retaliated or just ignore them, please know that I have apologized during these situations and try to walk away only to get to yelled at, cursed out or even threatened. I don't know if it's my tone of voice by not coming off as overly sincere or coming off as not caring, but something is really off about these situations.One example was today when I was coming home with a box of pizza. A man was walking behind me on my left, who I caught a short glimpse of. I was about to walk under an awning when I saw a pigeon and a bunch of bird crap under it and I quickly stopped and moved to left at the last minute. I ended up bumping into him and he got angry saying that I needed to watch where I'm going. I apologized and told I didn't see him it was an accident, which made him more angry and he started insulting me. I apologized again and repeated what happened, he kept insulting me. I pretty much got fed up at that point and hurled insults back while telling him I couldn't see him if standing behind me. This continued for a minute before we both walked while still shouting insults.Another situation happened on a train where it was packed and I was waiting to get a seat. A man had a suitcase in the seat and picking it up to get to off at the next stop. The train jerks and I trip to where the empty seat was. The similar thing happens like in the example above: man gets angry, I apologize and explain what happened, he's still angry and hurling insults, I yell back and we part ways.I have bumped or tripped into people by accident then say excuse me and apologize and said people will wave it off or say it's nothing serious. So why have these situations escalated even after I apologize? Was it because I didn't say excuse me as well, did I need to be overly sincere with saying sorry or were those men wrong for going off? I'm just looking for honest answers to this and why this could've happened.I'm also not sure if I posted this in the right Supreddit, so if anyone does know where I can post this at then thank you.

In this point in my life (and the lives of my classmates), its just too difficult meeting people in real life while trying to juggle med school. A lot of us were doing dating apps, and some of us were using a couple simultaneously just to meet the right person. But I don't think that intimacy has been completely thrown out the door. To be clear, I'm not even talking about sex. Just straight, genuine human connection and meaningful conversation. I've had some good experience on dates, and bad experiences on dates. Obviously, the bad dates were bad. And I think that just comes with the territory of online dating. I think the shtick about online dating is that everything is streamlined: profiles are made, questions are answered to match you to people who think like you, intentions are made clear from the get-go (hopefully). This kind of takes away from the naturally-growing intimacy that happens between two people as they get to know each other. You lay all your cards out on a table all at once and each person decides \"Okay, do I continue?\". I only went on a handful, and only with people who seemed interested in a serious relationship. And those dates were very intimate. Talked about our lives, our pasts, our dreams, and goals. You kind of share yourself in a way that you only do with a person you just met. And yeah, between getting harassed by very persistent men with very vulgar messages, it really did feel like true intimacy was dead - that the only interest was sex. But delete it and move on. Or, in my case, save them, and read them on a rainy day when you need a good laugh (not in a mean way, I swear. Just the people who would go 0-100 and proposition me for sex).But, I think dating apps are great. I think the problem with online dating *is* that streamlining process I mentioned above...but at the same time, I think it's the biggest benefit of online dating.

In this point in my life (and the lives of my classmates), its just too difficult meeting people in real life while trying to juggle med school. A lot of us were doing dating apps, and some of us were using a couple simultaneously just to meet the right person. But I don't think that intimacy has been completely thrown out the door. To be clear, I'm not even talking about sex. Just straight, genuine human connection and meaningful conversation. I've had some good experience on dates, and bad experiences on dates. Obviously, the bad dates were bad. And I think that just comes with the territory of online dating. I think the shtick about online dating is that everything is streamlined: profiles are made, questions are answered to match you to people who think like you, intentions are made clear from the get-go (hopefully). This kind of takes away from the naturally-growing intimacy that happens between two people as they get to know each other. You lay all your cards out on a table all at once and each person decides \"Okay, do I continue?\". I only went on a handful, and only with people who seemed interested in a serious relationship. And those dates were very intimate. Talked about our lives, our pasts, our dreams, and goals. You kind of share yourself in a way that you only do with a person you just met. And yeah, between getting harassed by very persistent men with very vulgar messages, it really did feel like true intimacy was dead - that the only interest was sex. But delete it and move on. Or, in my case, save them, and read them on a rainy day when you need a good laugh (not in a mean way, I swear. Just the people who would go 0-100 and proposition me for sex).But, I think dating apps are great. I think the problem with online dating *is* that streamlining process I mentioned above...but at the same time, I think it's the biggest benefit of online dating. You can know right away if someone political views don't align with yours, or if they have different ideas of family, do they have any serious dealbreakers (smoking, drugs), etc etc. But of course, I am biased.

We are in the same friend group so we have to see each other often and I kind of view him as an older brother because he is very protective. One thing I should mention is that he is very different with his girlfriend than he is with his friends/family. I think his girlfriend is very manipulative and uses his fear of being lonely to her advantage. She is very condescending and tries to bring others down to make herself look better. For example, she publicly embarrassed me when we worked together (lasted about 3 months before I quit) by telling me in front of customers that I am bad at my job even though I have more experience than her. She makes everything into a competition. A couple weeks ago I was driving her home from work and I broke down and told her that I was raped. This incident happened about a year ago; I don't want to mention too many details but basically I was unconscious and he took pictures and was showing it around to people. Anyway, her being the type of person she is tried to one up me by telling me she knows how I feel because her brother and cousin would eat her out and make her satisfy them when she was little. I am almost certain she is lying for lots of reasons, one of them being her relationship with them. She continues to post pictures of her with them, along with loving captions. I just feel like if her story were true, she would be traumatized and not able to face them... because that's how I feel about my rapist. Also, I've only known her about a year and her personality makes me think she is lying because that's what she does constantly. Bottom line is this is a really messed up story to make up and I want to tell my cousin because everyone thinks he needs to get out of this toxic relationship with her but I don't want to ruin my relationship with him because what if he doesn't believe me?

No shit. In fact, **77% of household returns report making less than $75K/year**. Looking at the number of returns that paid the ACA penalty (N09750) by income level and checking the average amount paid per return (A09750), we get the average penalty of $461.97 ( $3,079,255,000 in penalties / 6,665,470 penalty returns). Broken down by income level, we have:Under $1: $411.73 [see this before you freak out](https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/)$1 - $10K: $259.98$10K - $25K: $277.85$25K - $50K: $396.56$50K - $75K: $666.68$75K - $100K: $975.68$100K - $200K: $1,505.43$200K - $500K: $2,678.88$500K - $1M: $3,668.79Over $1M: $3,756.76Tax penalties that scale with your income level? More people in America make less than $75K/year than make more? Imagine that...Thanks so much Fox News, for letting me know that nearly 4 in 5 Americans make less than $75K/year, and for using that data to scare people to push an agenda that ultimately saves wealthy people money while attempting to strip poor people of their health insurance coverage.**EDIT:** To be clear, of the 6,665,470 penalty returns filed, 6,123,100 of them were for households earning less than $75K/year. Compared with the 542,370 penalty returns filed for households earning more than $75K, There were more than 11 times as many low and middle-income penalty returns filed in 2015. **So with 77% of total returns and almost 92% of penalty returns filed being from low to middle-income households, obviously the majority of households paying the ObamaCare penalty are low and middle-income.**", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "75iw13", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Fox News using IRS tax data to say that Obamacare is hurting the middle and lower class", "num_comments": 1, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 5, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 12683, "permalink": "/r/esist/comments/75iw13/fox_news_using_irs_tax_data_to_say_that_obamacare/", "submission_time": "Tue Oct 10 22:04:27 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Follow the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/esist/wiki/rules).

Then someone's precious little baby comes in, and tears up all that hard work... On top of your precious chickens that you care for. So many people demonize us because we're cruel dog killers... But in reality your dog is invading our property, and killing our pets. If your dog was kept on your property, none of this would happen. There is no excuse of \"he rushed the door\".
