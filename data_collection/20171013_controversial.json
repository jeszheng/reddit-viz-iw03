It's last 3 supereruptions were 0.63, 1.3 and 2.1 million years ago. So we have two inter-eruptive periods,  one of 0.67 and one of 0.8 million years.  Two data points is not a useful tend and there's at least a 130,000 year difference between them.  To put that in context anthropology puts the migration of modern humans out of Africa at something between 60-130,000 years ago.  So these aren't small variations in time.  Furthermore a super eruption completely reconfigures the volcanic edifice and plumbing system,  so there is no reason to expect that one supereruption will behave the same way as a previous one.  Anyone telling you about cyclicity or due dates on large volcanoes is severely misinformed.Ok,  so onto how we monitor and forecast.  Supervolcanoes are problematic in that we've never seen one erupt, so we have to go on geological evidence of past eruptions,  then a lot of applied rock physics. For a super eruption to go off the first thing is that we need over a thousand cubic kilometres of eruptable magma in the reservoir.  Eruptable is an important distinction. Lots of magma can get isolated off into unconnected mushes and parts of the plumbing.  Or can intrude as dykes which relatively rapidly cool down.  We can use seismic arrays to image plumbing systems (think ultrasound imaging - similar process,  different frequency) and estimate melt volumes,  but the resolution of these is still very low.  So we can track roughly how much melt is available.  Next is inflation of the volcano.  More magma underneath means the surface bulges more.  Given the the Yellowstone magma reservoir is something like 80km across this is a significant and easy thing to track (we can track surface motions of less than a millimeter with comparative ease).So there's plenty we can look at.  The issue is one of context.  We've only known about supervolcanoes for a couple of decades or so.  Our monitoring of them has been similarly short and often patchy.

These volcanoes simply do not work on human timescales.  Peaks and troughs in their activity are perfectly normal.  Perhaps even more importantly these thing erupt all the time! Its just that *most of their eruptions* are not super eruptions. So increases in seismic activity are not signs of imminent super eruption (Or even,  necessarily,  minor eruption). So we can be pretty confident that Yellowstone is not in immediate threat of super eruption; it's not close to what appears to be inflated enough to drive a super eruption.  And by immediate I mean in the next 10-20,000 years.  That said we have no idea what the magma recharge rate is at the moment or how it varies over time.

It's last 3 supereruptions were 0.63, 1.3 and 2.1 million years ago. So we have two inter-eruptive periods,  one of 0.67 and one of 0.8 million years.  Two data points is not a useful tend and there's at least a 130,000 year difference between them.  To put that in context anthropology puts the migration of modern humans out of Africa at something between 60-130,000 years ago.  So these aren't small variations in time.  Furthermore a super eruption completely reconfigures the volcanic edifice and plumbing system,  so there is no reason to expect that one supereruption will behave the same way as a previous one.  Anyone telling you about cyclicity or due dates on large volcanoes is severely misinformed.Ok,  so onto how we monitor and forecast.  Supervolcanoes are problematic in that we've never seen one erupt, so we have to go on geological evidence of past eruptions,  then a lot of applied rock physics. For a super eruption to go off the first thing is that we need over a thousand cubic kilometres of eruptable magma in the reservoir.  Eruptable is an important distinction. Lots of magma can get isolated off into unconnected mushes and parts of the plumbing.  Or can intrude as dykes which relatively rapidly cool down.  We can use seismic arrays to image plumbing systems (think ultrasound imaging - similar process,  different frequency) and estimate melt volumes,  but the resolution of these is still very low.

I have some suggestions you can try to find the origin of the problem:-Check for condition variations. Pure iPrOH and water are miscible in all proportions **at room temperature**. But if the mixture contains other compounds, the miscibility might change (I used to work with a 1:1 mixture of water and acetonitrile which are fully miscible, but after solving LiCl, miscibility dropped and became very dependent of temperature). A few degrees of difference in temperature might cross the line from 1 phase to 2 phases, and this implies a change in composition as both phases will be different. As an anecdote I know a couple of Physics who had problems with the magnetism of a sample a few years ago, as the new measurements were completely different from the measurements that made 4 months before. It turned out the sample contained gadolinium and the critical temperature is very close to room temperature. The first measurements where in winter (just under Tc) and the following in summer (above Tc), and that made a huge difference in its properties.-As you suggest, it might not be mixed as well as it should. It doesn\u2019t harm if before the first measurement you vigorously mix/stir the sample. It won\u2019t hurt and it will fix it in case it was the problem.-Some mixtures look homogeneous but they aren\u2019t. A true heterogeneous will form 2 phases or at least will look milky or opaque. If it looks clear, it might be a colloid. It is unlikely, but testing for it requires only 5 seconds. Just make use of the Tyndall effect to discard the presence of a colloid. If the solution is Tyndall positive, well\u2026 it\u2019s not homogeneous.-Are you sure the container is completely sealed between assays? If the container is not tight, some solvent might evaporate. iPrOH will evaporate faster than water, and composition can change (Raoult law\u2019s). Also, check the cap of the bottle. The iPrOH tank I used to have in my laboratory had a tiny hole to protect it fror overpressures, and that might be a leak for your tank. Also, a very slight composition change might happen if you just open the bottle and then close it again. The solvent vapor will leave and when you close, it will re-evaporate until achieving vapor pressure, which will change very slightly the composition. This is only important for small amounts of sample and very fine analyses (trace or microtrace), but I don\u2019t know what kind of analysis you perform.-Sometimes, given enough time, the compounds of the mixture can react. I saw this with acetone we bought in very high volumes. In theory, acetone is stable, but it can react with itself by an aldol condensation reaction.

The same thing might happen in your mixture: reactions between other components and water/iPrOH, or even of the solvent with air or each other, catalyzed by some other compound present in the solution. You can test it taking a small sample of your product, leaving it on a closed recipient that you can analyze (we used NMR, so we placed it in a very tightly closed NMR tube) and testing if every few days to see if there are any changes.-Also, we had problems a couple of times with tanks of acetone because they should be clean when they bottle it, but it wasn\u2019t perfectly clean.

If, as an individual, a women wants to do that fine.But it shouldn't be used as a campaign to prevent rape. It shouldn't be, that collectively, as a society, we tell women not to get raped. Rape is prevented by teaching young people about consent and what is rape, and by telling people not to rape. Not by telling women not to get raped. Because if we start saying \"why hasn't she taken self-defense classes?\" Its a slippery slope to why was her skirt so short? Why did she drink that much? Or why did she leave with him? And then, might as well question if she said no loud enough? Was it really clear that she didn't want it? Because she probably wanted it. And, as a society, we have to stop putting the burden of getting raped, or not, on women and placing it on the people who actually rape. >One of the narratives arising from this hashtag was women being outraged by us men not doing more: essentially a call for us to \"step up\" and stop shielding criminals behind some sort of \"bro-code\" that normalized rapist behavior as a natural consequence of our testosterone or whatever. I didn't really understand the logic behind those accusations, Because too often rape and sexual assault are placed under \"well you know, boys will be boys\" or \"it's locker talk\". If it's locker talk than maybe other men could say that that kind of talk isn't funny, that that kind of talk isn't welcomed. And that touching a women without her consent isn't okay. Or because a male judge has sentenced an athlete to 6 months of jail time because \"his life would be ruined otherwise, he's a bright young man with a bright future ahead of him\". Nevermind him being a rapist. That rapist ended up doing only 3 months of jail time. That has to change. That's the \"bro-code\" or rape culture feminist are talking about. >similar to how earthquake or tornado-preparation drills are provided by the government as a free service to its citizensAre you comparing rape to natural disasters? Like rapes are just part of nature and we can't prevent them? And there's nothing we can do against them other then getting prepared for when they come? >To my shock, immediately I was accused of \"victim-blaming\" because I was supposedly placing the burden of action on women, when instead I should be suffocating \"rape culture\" by doing ... I'm not exactly sure what, to be honest. Admonishing aspiring rapists not to rape, and simply hoping for the best? Advocating for random searches of men on the street to make sure they weren't packing date-rape drugs? Pre-emptively jailing men with abnormally high testosterone levels as a safety precaution?Most rapes are not the kind of rapes where the victim didn't know her attacker and was overpowered in a dark alley. Most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, someone the victim feels safe with, or is too intoxicated to fight back. So self-defense are useless when you physically can't fight or when you freeze and dissociates while someone you trusted is using your body without your consent. >since you can't snuff out their existence entirely, you can at least take steps to ensure their eventual effect on the world is as *minimal* as possible. We probably can't prevent all the rapes but we can prevent it. With education, early on. We can teach consent and when someone can't consent. Its been proven that it helps reduce the number of rapes. >\"if victim-blaming is a thing, then why do modern homes come with door-locks installed? Is it smart to shift the narrative away from locking doors or cars, and start focusing instead on how we can stop 'burglar culture' from violating people's privacy?\"Are you comparing women to material property? Are you suggesting we lock up women at night because men might be tempted to rape them ? Because men have such poor self-control that they wouldn't be able to avoid using a women without her consent?I am appalled. I believe men have more control than that. Its sad that you don't think they do. Burglar culture isn't one. Rape culture is. >Forgive me if I'm wrong, but \"stop expecting *women* to do something about sexual violence!\" sounds a *lot* to me like \"until criminals stop being criminals, we feminists are okay with women being exposed to *as* much risk as statistically possible\".Women consider the danger of going out at all time. \"Will I have to walk alone in the dark in that of the city?\" \"That park looks too dark, I'll go around\" Some girls when they go out, use the motto of \"leave no men be hind\" because it's too risky to. They make they all come back together. I have personally pushed men of my friends that were too drunk to consent numerous times in bars. We protect each other.  Remind me how women do nothing? >All I'm wondering at is the wisdom of \"the philosophy of female inaction\", which in this particular context sounds a *lot* like the very same \"damsel-in-distress\" worldview that modern feminism takes a public stance *against*: the crusade against \"victim-blaming\" seems to imply that women are helpless in doing something against sexual violence, and must rely entirely on the goodwill and action of men in order for this problem to be overcome.So asking men to not rape women is acting like damsels in distress. Again, I didn't think men had such weak will power that it was such an outrageous request. I think that telling someone to not do something when a whole culture tells them that they can, that standing up for your safety and that of your friends is fucking badass. Not damsels in distress.

The stories were disturbingly commonplace and eerily familiar: some sort of employer or family member inevitably forcing victims to participate in unwanted massages (or worse), and victims being unable to react for fear of financial or physical backlash.One of the narratives arising from this hashtag was women being outraged by us men not doing more: essentially a call for us to \"step up\" and stop shielding criminals behind some sort of \"bro-code\" that normalized rapist behavior as a natural consequence of our testosterone or whatever. I didn't really understand the logic behind those accusations, but I figured the people leveling them weren't being malicious in doing so, and so I offered my two cents on the matter to add a slightly dissenting opinion to the mix.One of the ideas I raised online was subsidized self-defense classes for people across the nation, similar to how earthquake or tornado-preparation drills are provided by the government as a free service to its citizens (I actually remember being part of something like this in 7th grade, but those \"lessons\" were *way* too short and absolutely worthless, outdated crap by modern standards). My idea was to have MMA fighters like Bas Rutten and Ronda Rousey contracted by the government to offer practical, real-world tips on how somebody (especially with lighter bodyweight and/or confined surroundings) could make the most of any situation, and upload these tutorials as a free resource for anyone to learn at home. It wouldn't be a perfect solution by any means, but simply a small step towards ensuring the social footprint of sexual violence becoming as small as possible.To my shock, immediately I was accused of \"victim-blaming\" because I was supposedly placing the burden of action on women, when instead I should be suffocating \"rape culture\" by doing ... I'm not exactly sure what, to be honest. Admonishing aspiring rapists not to rape, and simply hoping for the best? Advocating for random searches of men on the street to make sure they weren't packing date-rape drugs? Pre-emptively jailing men with abnormally high testosterone levels as a safety precaution?See, here's where I start to not understand the whole backlash against supposed \"victim-blaming\": I'm a huge fan of martial arts, and one of the core tenets of basically any art is sufficient preparation for the world around you; this is because it's essentially taken for granted that there will *always* be criminals out there, and since you can't snuff out their existence entirely, you can at least take steps to ensure their eventual effect on the world is as *minimal* as possible. Yes, it's also a relatively violent outlook by conventional Western standards, but as a personal believer in the death penalty for rapists of any age and gender, I've pretty much \"drawn my line in the sand\" on that issue.The online discussions devolved into bickering not long after that, but a retort I wish I followed up with was \"if victim-blaming is a thing, then why do modern homes come with door-locks installed? Is it smart to shift the narrative away from locking doors or cars, and start focusing instead on how we can stop 'burglar culture' from violating people's privacy?\" Forgive me if I'm wrong, but \"stop expecting *women* to do something about sexual violence!\" sounds a *lot* to me like \"until criminals stop being criminals, we feminists are okay with women being exposed to *as* much risk as statistically possible\".Don't get me wrong, nobody is claiming that self-defense classes are magically going to eradicate all rape, or that all attackers are unrelated strangers to each victim, or even that self-defense lessons are *guaranteed* to help you in an assault situation. All I'm wondering at is the wisdom of \"the philosophy of female inaction\", which in this particular context sounds a *lot* like the very same \"damsel-in-distress\" worldview that modern feminism takes a public stance *against*: the crusade against \"victim-blaming\" seems to imply that women are helpless in doing something against sexual violence, and must rely entirely on the goodwill and action of men in order for this problem to be overcome.I appreciate any and all opinions on the matter at hand, and although I don't expect to find common ground with the majority of people in this Sub, I can at least feel better knowing that I tried to learn something I didn't know before.Cheers, mates**Edit:** Here are some articles that share my particular opinion, and I'm wondering whether the people of this Sub agree with them (or why they don't) - [I](https://www.newstatesman.com/society/2014/06/suggesting-women-learn-self-defence-opposite-victim-blaming) [II](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/i-dont-believe-selfdefence-training-is-victim-blaming-and-im-a-feminist/news-story/c84cfbdbf94430344f9647894dacb345) [III](https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/07/self-defense-blame-victims/) [IV](https://gendersociety.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/empowering-women-not-just-protecting-them/)[Here](https://everydayvictimblaming.com/evb-analysis/this-thing-about-feminist-self-defence/#more-%27) is also a counter-argument for people interested, although I admit I wasn't really able to boil down that article to its basic points :|", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "761xjd", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "I'm Having Trouble Distinguishing Between The Terms \"Victim-Blaming\" And \"Safety Precautions\"", "num_comments": 6, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 0, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 581, "permalink": "/r/Feminism/comments/761xjd/im_having_trouble_distinguishing_between_the/", "submission_time": "Fri Oct 13 06:38:50 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "You wrote a lot of stuff to say, \"I advocated victim blaming and people did not like it.\"We have drills for tornadoes and fire b/c those things are usually natural, totally uncontrollable, and outside of any sphere of understanding that Nipplesweat, Kansas IS NOT interested in being wiped off the map by swirling wind.Rapists can absolutely decide if they are going to touch a person, say something disgusting, or insert parts of their body into parts of someone else's body.

If, as an individual, a women wants to do that fine.But it shouldn't be used as a campaign to prevent rape. It shouldn't be, that collectively, as a society, we tell women not to get raped. Rape is prevented by teaching young people about consent and what is rape, and by telling people not to rape. Not by telling women not to get raped. Because if we start saying \"why hasn't she taken self-defense classes?\" Its a slippery slope to why was her skirt so short? Why did she drink that much? Or why did she leave with him? And then, might as well question if she said no loud enough? Was it really clear that she didn't want it? Because she probably wanted it. And, as a society, we have to stop putting the burden of getting raped, or not, on women and placing it on the people who actually rape. >One of the narratives arising from this hashtag was women being outraged by us men not doing more: essentially a call for us to \"step up\" and stop shielding criminals behind some sort of \"bro-code\" that normalized rapist behavior as a natural consequence of our testosterone or whatever. I didn't really understand the logic behind those accusations, Because too often rape and sexual assault are placed under \"well you know, boys will be boys\" or \"it's locker talk\". If it's locker talk than maybe other men could say that that kind of talk isn't funny, that that kind of talk isn't welcomed. And that touching a women without her consent isn't okay. Or because a male judge has sentenced an athlete to 6 months of jail time because \"his life would be ruined otherwise, he's a bright young man with a bright future ahead of him\". Nevermind him being a rapist. That rapist ended up doing only 3 months of jail time. That has to change. That's the \"bro-code\" or rape culture feminist are talking about. >similar to how earthquake or tornado-preparation drills are provided by the government as a free service to its citizensAre you comparing rape to natural disasters? Like rapes are just part of nature and we can't prevent them? And there's nothing we can do against them other then getting prepared for when they come? >To my shock, immediately I was accused of \"victim-blaming\" because I was supposedly placing the burden of action on women, when instead I should be suffocating \"rape culture\" by doing ... I'm not exactly sure what, to be honest. Admonishing aspiring rapists not to rape, and simply hoping for the best? Advocating for random searches of men on the street to make sure they weren't packing date-rape drugs? Pre-emptively jailing men with abnormally high testosterone levels as a safety precaution?Most rapes are not the kind of rapes where the victim didn't know her attacker and was overpowered in a dark alley. Most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, someone the victim feels safe with, or is too intoxicated to fight back. So self-defense are useless when you physically can't fight or when you freeze and dissociates while someone you trusted is using your body without your consent. >since you can't snuff out their existence entirely, you can at least take steps to ensure their eventual effect on the world is as *minimal* as possible. We probably can't prevent all the rapes but we can prevent it. With education, early on. We can teach consent and when someone can't consent. Its been proven that it helps reduce the number of rapes. >\"if victim-blaming is a thing, then why do modern homes come with door-locks installed? Is it smart to shift the narrative away from locking doors or cars, and start focusing instead on how we can stop 'burglar culture' from violating people's privacy?\"Are you comparing women to material property? Are you suggesting we lock up women at night because men might be tempted to rape them ? Because men have such poor self-control that they wouldn't be able to avoid using a women without her consent?I am appalled. I believe men have more control than that. Its sad that you don't think they do. Burglar culture isn't one. Rape culture is. >Forgive me if I'm wrong, but \"stop expecting *women* to do something about sexual violence!\" sounds a *lot* to me like \"until criminals stop being criminals, we feminists are okay with women being exposed to *as* much risk as statistically possible\".Women consider the danger of going out at all time. \"Will I have to walk alone in the dark in that of the city?\" \"That park looks too dark, I'll go around\" Some girls when they go out, use the motto of \"leave no men be hind\" because it's too risky to. They make they all come back together. I have personally pushed men of my friends that were too drunk to consent numerous times in bars. We protect each other.  Remind me how women do nothing? >All I'm wondering at is the wisdom of \"the philosophy of female inaction\", which in this particular context sounds a *lot* like the very same \"damsel-in-distress\" worldview that modern feminism takes a public stance *against*: the crusade against \"victim-blaming\" seems to imply that women are helpless in doing something against sexual violence, and must rely entirely on the goodwill and action of men in order for this problem to be overcome.So asking men to not rape women is acting like damsels in distress. Again, I didn't think men had such weak will power that it was such an outrageous request. I think that telling someone to not do something when a whole culture tells them that they can, that standing up for your safety and that of your friends is fucking badass. Not damsels in distress.

She was against it because she reasoned that once I started, I would have to keep it up all the time, I was embarrassed to go to the beach with boys. Eventually I just did it without her permission, and we were both reasonably happy.In my teenage years, I watched as all the girls spent a extortionate amount of money and time on various hair removal methods, and I myself tried all of them.As I grew up and into my early twenties, I began feeling uncomfortable with the situation. I didn't enjoy the act of removing hair from my body (except maybe when my sisters plucked my eyebrows - that would always relax me and make me fall asleep for some reason). It always seemed to grow right back. I've never been overly well kept. In the summer I wear dresses but don't always remember to brush my hair. In the winter it's mostly jeans and giant knitted jumpers.So when stopped shaving my legs every winter, it wasn't really a big deal. I realised that I wanted to be free to choose for myself, sometimes removing hair and sometimes not. My body is mine, and it's hair growth or lack of doesn't harm anyone else at all. But a few months ago, after having chosen to let it grow for a few weeks in the middle of the summer (a relatively new development) I started 'caring' about other people's reactions. I noticed I was getting a lot of negative reactions, from all sorts of people. From my strong, feminist female close friends who would flinch and say that it's disgusting, from my gay male tell-each-other-anything best friend who refuses to look at me. Raised eyebrows, looks of disgust. Comments from acquaintances, accusations that I am neglecting myself, lazy, unattractive.Nothing personal, just directly around the leg hair growing on my legs.The worst reaction really is from my mum, who wishes that I would \"just be like everybody else\". (Ironic, considering she spent my first two decades praising me that I'm unique and special.) I think she's mostly worried that I will escape to India and be a hippy and renounce my fairly religious upbringing. The negative response I had from occasionally having hair on my legs made me realise - This isn't a choice. Women are not truly free to make independent decisions about body hair, because of the outside pressure and expectation. It is practically compulsory in my society to have hairless legs, and those who don't are not only repulsive, they are also going against cultural norms, which can be viewed as disrespectful.I believe that women and men should have authority on their own bodies. No one else.So I decided to make the choice to not remove the hair from my legs, not even if I feel like it. It is now a symbol for me, it starts conversation, it is most definitely a provocation.As the hairs on my shins grow, so does my confidence. I don't mind what people think of me. I know that if I get into conversation with anyone about it, they are at least going to think about it. Even if it's just the realisation that not every woman wants to shave her legs, and not every man is content with being hairy.As it happens, the most positive reactions I have had are from my boyfriend, who supports the decision  and isn't effected by my leg hair,  and other straight male friends.

Now I think it's worth noting these things: I'm a male, cisgender, french canadian person, and while I am a huge proponent for gender equality, I'm not very involved in feminism NOR AM I KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF. so I want to issue a huge TRIGGER WARNING if I say stuff or use words incorrectly, etc etcso what has to change in society so that these kinds of rapes don't happen? because it makes me mad, since on one side the girl was not only raped but powerless to act against it, but on the other, doing sensibility training to every single male is the same as saying the three men that raped her are not way WAY out of the norm, and every man alive is one sensitivity course away from raping the first defenseless woman they see. My opinion, personally, is that it's the opposite of the gun problem, where we can't take the harm out of the trouble maker's hands, so we have to fight against it. The obvious problem is the biological difference between men and women, but there's the underlying problem that women (again, I might seem insensitive, but what I mean is most women I encounter, all y'all ladies are unique and different) seem to be too aware of that difference. and I feel like that's starting to fade away. we hear more and more stories of women that defend themselves successfully from rapists and I think that's awesome, but that should be the norm. I don't quite know where I'm going with this, so this is sort of the point where I want to hear your opinion, but I think, personally, that there's something that has to change, because seeing stories like these break my heart, especially since I literally don't know how she could avoided the 2 additional rapes after the first one (without wanting to victim blame, she PROBABLY(which it sucks I have to put emphasis on) would have been safe in a cab, but my point in this very long post is that it sucks absolute shit that she can't fucking walk down the street safely)put shortly, I think (at least at this point in time) that while it is totally their fault, prevention on these fuckers would be difficult to enforce, because no normal human being attacks anyone going down the street, period. the fact it's rape makes it worst, but preventing those attacks is just as hard as preventing people from randomly throwing a right hook at a defenseless old man on the street. so we'd have to change the idea that women are powerless, or I don't know what but I feel like some of the women I speak put limits on themselves because they're women, even if it's just while throwing a football or play fighting.FINAL WORD: please limit the hate. any (if at all) offense you may perceive comes from misinformation and carelessness from my part, I swear I come here with nothing more than a desire for conversation. I don't want IN ANY WAY to diminish how bad rape is, I don't want IN ANY WAY to victim blame, and I'm not trying to do any other thing that might bring you any rage, anger or sadness. I come here to be educated and start a discussion. and so, let us open this horrible can of worms.EDIT: I just want to say, I'm really glad with how this post is turning out. I used to feel like this subreddit jumped to conclusions fast and was hard to have a decent conversation with, but my ideas have changed.

Yesterday, their was a meeting held specifically for females majoring in a tech related field. I wasn't planning on going (I never really attend any optional meetings at my school...) but another girl in my department that I knew nothing about (except her name, all the girls in the CS department are aware of one another's existence. Even though we don't necessarily socialize everyday) asked me to go with her. Me not knowing how to say \"no\", I agreed :-) . So I attended of course, and basically I heard what I expected. Salary gap... female to male employee ratios... not that I have a problem with having heard this but as a female CS major, it's no news to me. However, the main point of this meeting was to present a mentoring program that is organized by a few women that work at Cagemini (a software company in France, where I'm attending college). Throughout the year, students that decide to participate will have a mentor that will help them through their career choices, writing their CVs, finding internships at places like Airbus, Amazon WebServices..., providing reference letters for our Masters Degree applications, and eventually getting hired at Cagemini. Of course, I found this awesome, especially considering the fact that getting an internship, no matter your major, in this city can be hard. So I decided to sign up.    Today, I told one of my closest friends in the department (a guy, let's call him Jack) about what happened at this meeting. His reaction honestly made me question his sense of reality. First of all, Jack is a very opinionated person and he's never afraid to let people know that, be it a student, teacher, bus driver... So talking to him about a meeting directed towards females, arranged by females... well, I was expecting him to find some sort of problem with it. So basically, he went off on me saying that he hopes that I didn't apply (I didn't tell him whether or not I did) because the fact that this opportunity is only available to females is \"ridiculous\". \"What are us guys supposed to do?!\". Honestly I had know idea how to answer him because, I deal with these sort of reactions from him often, but him saying that as a guy going into the tech industry, in my opinion, is thoughtless. Jack is going into a field that is dominated by men and even in classes I have had to work much harder to prove myself to my professors than he has ever had to.    The thing that bothers me the most about this exchange is the fact that I had know idea how to counter what he said or how to deal with mindless outbursts like those in general (trust me I have to deal with them on regularly...). Something I despise about myself is my inability to thoroughly express my opinions... So, onto the point of this post: Am I overthinking this? How would you have defended yourself in this situation?

Would love suggestions on dealing with this.Last summer I completed a research internship at another university and worked with another undergrad intern (call this guy B). He was not numerically documenting results from trials or coming up with a logical course of action for future ones. Instead, I was left to do that and had to run so many trials on my own, which ended up being more than him. Even though I was paid for 40 hours per week, I was actually putting in 50 and sometimes 60 to get them done. There were also several times where he did not attend group meetings for the entire lab even though it was expected of everyone.Fast forward a couple months and yet another student in the lab (not an intern but a normal student worker, whi we will call C) picked up the project and submitted an abstract to a conference. The PI of the lab sent me an email asking if I wanted to go along. I personally could not attend the conference due to conflicts with other things (i.e. my home department is getting reaccredited and the head wants me to talk with the auditors.) C asked if he could include me as an author, and I said yes. (EDIT: I did not say to include me without this question as originally implied. It was bizzarre that he asked, as authorship is usually implied.)We both knew this guy, and I at least thought he noticed how much longer I was in the lab. However, he included me as the second author and the other intern B as the first author. (For those of you not familiar with research, the order in which authors are cited is an indicator of how much each contributed. First author usually goes to the most active author and it goes down from there, but last author is usually reserved for the PI or other senior researcher.) So the order ended us as B, myself, and C. For some reason, the PI was not cited.I am honestly at a loss on dealing with this because I wasn't there to decide the order for citing us.

I'm a part of Tent City's mayoral staff, and have a duty to try to moderate some of the drinking/loud music/yelling after hours. About 3 hours ago, we, including the Director of Student Life, asked this group of students to turn their music down. Just now, I was recently going to retrieve my backpack from my tent, and the same offenders asked me, \"Is my music too loud now?\" In a mocking tone. I asked them to show me their student ID's, and told them I would happily take their speaker if they wanted to speak to me like that again. I walked away, my heart racing, and then overheard them speaking again. \"I WILL RAPE HER.\" One of them said, in the most serious tone. Others cheered in agreement. Adrenaline kicked in. I ran up, and actually caused a bit of scene. I said, \"I CAN HEAR YOU. I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO RAPE ME.\" The guy retorted, \"I WASN'T EVEN F****** TALKING ABOUT YOU.\" I yelled back \"WHO WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT THEN? THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO IN ANY CONTEXT. I KNOW YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ME. YOU'RE AN AWFUL PERSON.\" I couldn't control myself. By this time, my guy friends pulled me back, and I was hysterical.

In front of their friends.. with no repercussions, just validation. I can't stop crying. I can't stop shaking. If this is this guys response to an argument with a woman, it's not the first time he's responded this way, and it won't be the last. We talked with the police, who said they will remove them from Tent City. I just needed to share this with someone. There are no girlfriends I can call at this hour, and I don't want to worry my parents while they're asleep. I'm okay. I simply cannot believe I heard those words.

Did I really want to go? yes! even though I wasn't a huge fan, I wanted to hang out with my dad and brother and have a good time. Yes, I drank, I had two jack and cokes, the concert was 3 hours. It is relevant to the situation. when we went outside, uber was not working for me (there were a lot of people looking for rides after the concert) so my dad had to order one and it took longer than expected (around 10 minutes). Outside of the venue, there was a guy who was clearly drunk (and sort of belligerent). He was bugging us, so, my dad being the 'peacemaker' that he is, told him to fuck off. OF COURSE this escalated things more than it should have, and the drunk guy was irritated. At this point he pushed my dad, so I told him to \"fuck off somewhere else and leave us alone, why couldn't he just go around the corner and get out of here?\". Of course, after the situation I realize I shouldn't have engaged him, but here's where my dilemma comes in- everyone (my boyfriend, mother, brother, and father) told me that I should have left it alone! they've totally ignored the fact that my dad was the one who escalated, and said that I should have \"calmed down\" and that it may have been dangerous. like, WHAT?!! so my dad can be an asshole but as soon as I do anything nearing his behavior I'm a bitch that needs to get herself in line? I'm so tired of having to keep my 'unreasonable emotions' in check while he can call someone an asshole and it's totally fine. I'm honestly looking for somewhere to vent, please tell me if I'm totally wrong (I'll explain the situation in more detail if needed) I'm open to suggestions to help my behavior. I'm tired of being the 'emotional referee' for my family, aiding in cooling down everyone else's meltdowns, but as soon as I show an emotion I'm a totally crazy bitch.

She told me that what she was wearing was business attire; the kind of thing that she would wear to a job interview.
