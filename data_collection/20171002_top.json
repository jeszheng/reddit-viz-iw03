We ended up under a makeshift tent where she showed me this book and told me about her dream to go to some place in South America one day. But she had no idea how to get there, and since we were now in a club, she made me swear to take her there. I agreed out of panic, because she still scared me.The next thing you know, we were married. We fixed up the house we met in, and vowed to save up enough money to move to South America one day.

We were staying in these little cabin things that were really cozy and hanging out around town and Rocky Mountain National Park in our free time. On our last day, this van showed up and parked in a lot across the clubhouse from our cabins. The van was covered in all these crazy designs and a bunch of people climbed out of it and set up camp. We started making some jokes about them because the van was from Canada, but they seemed cool enough. At one point I was walking to the clubhouse and I passed a guy and girl carrying dishes from an outdoor sink and I noticed they had interesting accents. I stopped and asked them about their accents and they told me they were from England who were studying abroad in Canada. So they were the guys who came in that crazy van! We talked for a little bit and got to know each other. They were in Canada for college and they and a group of their friends decided to come through the central US for holiday. Their route was like from Montana to Utah, where they told me they swam in some natural pools that were freezing, down to Colorado, where they were as we talked, then going west to the California coast. I told them that I was there on a class trip and we were from north Texas on a camping trip to various locations, with where we were being the last stop on our trip. They asked what I was doing that night and asked if I wanted to go drink with them, I said I was going into town with my class that night to look for animals, but I would join them if I could. They told me their names and I told them mine, Ray (just call me Ray for now).A little while later I was with my group and we had started a couple campfires to make hobo meals. We noticed that we still had a lot of firewood left and didn\u2019t want to waste it. We noticed two girls sitting over by the van, laying out all their camping stuff. Members of my group were suggesting we go take the extra wood to them. I spoke up and said I had talked to a couple members of their group, got to know them and they\u2019re pretty cool. Then they all suggested that I go take the rest of our firewood to them.\u201cWhat? Why me?\u201d\u201cCause they already know you Ray, and we\u2019re awkward.\u201d\u201cLike hell yall are awkward. Why don\u2019t one of you come with me? That way they\u2019ll know you too.\u201d\u201cNah dude, just go do it.\u201dSo I carry these two bundles of logs over to these two girls who are laying out all these camping supplies. With as much confidence as I could muster, I detail to them how I met a couple of their friends earlier and I was just bringing extra firewood my group couldn\u2019t use and wanted to know if they wanted it. I told them where I was from and why I was there and I pointed over to my group, and I look over and see half of my class gathered around watching me like a zoo as I talk to these two girls. The girls were very grateful and asked if they needed to pay me but I declined every time. Like their friends, they asked if I wanted to drink with them later and I said I would if I could, as well as tell them my name. A couple guys in my group kept pestering me if I got any of their numbers or if they needed to let me have our cabin to \u201courselves\u201d tonight and i kept shaking them off.Later that night, we drove around the town and saw a few foxes. When we got back, we saw a small campfire next to that van with all those English kids around it. I took a shower so I wouldn\u2019t have to the following morning and afterwards thought about joining those English kids for a drink. I was really hesitant about it for some reason, I didn\u2019t want to just walk up randomly and hang out. I talked to a couple members of my group about it and they kept telling me to go for it as well as making crude remarks about the girls I talked to. I told my classmates to shut up and finally decided to join the English kids. I walked up and heard them talking but they started to shush when I got close.\u201cHey someone\u2019s coming. Uh, hey.\u201d\u201cOh, uh hey.\u201d\u201cCan....we help you?\u201d\u201cOh uh it\u2019s me, um, Ray.\u201dThen they all stood up and raised their arms and shouted \u201cRay!!!\u201d And happily welcomed me to their circle. They were burning the firewood I brought them earlier and they offered me a beer. I don\u2019t really like beer so I turned them down. We sat there and talked about England and America, I told them about Texas where I was from. They were so amused by all the culturally different things here in America, especially food serving sizes, as well as looking at the sky and noting how many beautiful places were in our country and how you could see so many stars. We talked for a while longer before I finally said goodnight to them as it started to lightly rain and they started packing up. I never gave them any contact info but I do wish I did so I could keep in contact with them on the rest of their journey. The next morning when we were leaving, I saw their van sitting there quietly in the fog. I thought about leaving them a note saying \u201chappy trails. -Ray\u201d but I didn\u2019t. Still one of the coolest moments I\u2019ve ever had on vacation.

Wait, wait, hear me out on this one.I'm talking specifically about non-scientific use.  First, in a normal year, the temperature is going to vary, but the coldest it's gonna get is about 0 degrees and the hottest it'll be is around 100. It's a scale made to be practical.  Celsius is what, like -18 to 40ish?  The numbers aren't as smooth.  Plus it sounds way more badass.  It's 120 in Phoenix this week?  Holy crap! It's 48 in Phoenix this week? Yeah, OK.Next, you have greater precision in ambient temperature measurements.  If I want it just a touch warmer, I'll change it from 72 to 73.  Perfect, but in Celsius 22 to 23 is a bigger jump.  You need decimals to be precise, but my AC doesn't let me use them.  I prefer that kind of fine control.Next you don't need to use negative numbers as much.  If you forget or miss a minus here or there in Farenheit, it's not as big of a deal. If you do in Celsius, you risk burst pipes or slipping on ice.Last, Celsius is only really useful for measuring the temperature of water.  0 to 100 is beautiful, but I've literally never used 100C in my life.  Boiling water?  I'm not measuring that, I'm waiting for the bubbles.  Making tea?  I'm waiting for my kettle to click off.Celsius is fantastic for scientific uses.  It should still be used there because it does a better job measuring what needs to be measured.  However, as just a regular ol' dude, it's just not as practical or useful as Fahrenheit for my day to day use.  Fahrenheit was created for the specific job of being practical, and it has achieved that.  It is a good, practical scale.Edit: to be clear.  I don't want the rest of the world to switch to Fahrenheit.  That would be impractical and stupid.  But Fahrenheit is extremely good at what it does.  Being a practical scale.Clearly this is a minor thing.  But it's just one stupid thing I've realized most of the world happens to do wrong because we were set in motion that way.

All the adults were om the deck or inside so us kids (maybe 8 or so of us between the ages of 5 and 12) decided to play Ghost in the Graveyard. Our yard was narrow but very long with a lot of grass on the left and a raised deck that spanned the whole right side of the yard. For a short kid, you could easily crouch under and walk around under the deck, so it made for awesome hiding spots. I was at the very back of the yard and hiding next to the shed, in the pitch dark. I had a little flashlight but this was my yard, so I knew every inch of it and was comfortable in the dark. I could hear the other kids on the side of the yard that was all grass but from where I was, I was looking directly at the underside of the deck that went around our above ground pool. I heard a noise and looked over to see if anyone was coming from under the deck and I remember suddenly freezing in place.From under the deck, this thing came forward. It was all black, just this dense black shadow the size of a huge man, definitely not a kid and there was no way an adult could have crawled the whole length of the deck to the back of the yard with so little noise. It looked like it was made of smoke, and it moved weirdly, like it was unfolding. I was terrified, all I could do was stare and hear my blood pounding in my ears. It stood up all the way and it looked massive, the only way I could describe it was like a silhouette of the Hulk, I swear to god. It stood for a moment then walked through the chainlink fence into my neighbors yard and blended into the trees. I started crying and ran for it, found my best friend Adam and just wailed. He was so confused and just brought me inside to my mom. I was so scared to go outside for a few months after that and I NEVER went back under the deck again.

Three years ago, living in CO, the station got a call about a 'ghost' in someone's house. I wasn't the one on the phone, but apparently the person was hysterical and hard to understand. I arrived on the scene, this woman of about forty was standing in her front yard. The house is upper middle class, pretty bland.She swears there is a ghost inside. The only reason we didn't disregard the call is because she claimed there was screaming in her attic. She claimed the ghost was doing it, I was supposed to make sure an animal wasn't stuck up there or something. She explains she has been hearing this screaming and bumping on the walls the past two days, she is the only one who lives there, no pets who could cause it, neighbors are in vacation. So, of course, the logical explanation is a ghost.She was far too afraid to check the attic, so I head up there. It was full of cobwebs and musty, and of course the only lightbulb didn't work. I take a step, and all the sudden I hear banging and muffled yelling. Navigating with my flashlight, I head over to the source, a corner in the far back.There was a hobo there. His leg had fallen through the floor and was stuck, and he couldn't get out. He started crying tears of joy when I walked over, thanking me and asking for help simultaneously. I pull him out, trying to scratch his leg as little as possible, and lead him outside after letting him stop and get some water.He told me he was just looking for a place to spend the night, and I felt like he had gotten punished enough for his trespass. I asked if he needed anything else before I sent him on his way. Right when he opened his mouth to speak, I realised that he was a fifty foot tall, grey leviathan from the paleolithic era.

I still frequent but I've made up my mind not to dive into this any further. I don't like how it turned out.  So my local pub has a ghost and they say it\u2019s an old lady who passed away upstairs. She apparently likes to make a mess around when they need to close up, between 2-3am. She's knocked over kegs in the backroom when everyone is out front and opening and slamming shut the women\u2019s bathroom door. Now they put a chair in the women\u2019s restroom (apparently she likes having a place to sit) and they prop the bathroom door open when they are cleaning up. Well I started noticing this weird watermark on the chair of the bathroom. There is no water dripping, and it\u2019s not like someone peed on the chair, but the watermark is there, and it's the face of an old woman. I know this sounds unreal. I wish I had kept a picture of it handy. Anyway, the first watermark is small and just looks like an old lady\u2019s portrait photo. It reminded me of [this](https://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/5497221/il_340x270.311515317.jpg), and I remember thinking, \"Huh, that watermark looks a lot like those old necklaces.\" Her hair it up and it's her profile. I still thought it was bizarre, kind of like a cloud animal, but didn\u2019t make a big deal about it. One day I go into the pub bathroom, and small watermark has faded, and it's replaced by this GIGANTIC watermark. That's face forward, the SAME FACE AND HAIR STYLE of this old lady, only now her mouth is open! It looked like she was screaming and it was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable to look at.I was like \u201cOh haaailll no\u2026\u201d I brought my mutual friend (bartender), in to look at it and we were like, \u201cThat\u2019s spooky.\u201d So we decide to name the ghost and try to set her free, as you do. I can\u2019t remember what we named her but I SWEAR it looked like she stopped screaming, and it was replaced by a smile. I was like, \"well that's awesome!\" and my friend and I congratulated ourselves. Over the next month, the watermark slowly disappeared, and it was REPLACED BY THIS EVIL DEMON MAN WITH A GOATEE! Like, looks like the actual devil, creepy ass grin. WTF NO. Watermarks SHOULDN\u2019T LOOK LIKE FACES. THAT'S THREE IN A ROW! NO MORE!So that\u2019s when I nope-d out of there and stopped paying attention to the watermark. I did recently see that someone wrote \u201cCheeto<3\u201d on the bathroom stall. Which made me pause and panic. And I mean my reddit name, NOT my actual name. I haven\u2019t told anyone I know my reddit name besides that bartender friend that named the ghost lady with me, and it appeared on the bathroom stall 3 months after she stopped working there.I'll post the photo of the evil watermark if I go in the pub today if someone really wants me to, but it makes me really uneasy.

I've experienced what it feels like to be recognized as both genders and had the hormones to go with it. I am far happier now for mental health reasons, but it really interesting looking at the best and worse of both sides from my experience (some things my vary)Female life: Most people say hi to you and look you up and down regardless of which gender they are. Many people will have conversations with you out of nowhere, which is both good and bad. Bad if you're feeling introverted (or the person is one that never shuts up), good if you're social and like meeting new people.People will hold open doors. Guys especially will hold open a door as far as 20 feet away! Menstrual cramps are worse than being sick (or it was for me) and about on par with recovering from surgery, every month.Everything is far more vibrant. Your emotions are in a constant flux, and while it's utter chaos, the ups and downs of life feel more intense. The clothing and hair style expression is a lot more open with possibilities. Male life:For better or worse, outside of family and friends, no one gives a fuck about you initially. They don't say hi, and most people avert their eyes if they see you looking their way. This is sometimes even translates to women seeing men as predators by default, crossing the street or quicking their pace at night.Much less affects you emotionally, and your mood changes gradually. If you're generally happy, you'll stay happy for days or weeks, but if a lot of bad happens you'll be upset for about as long. Also, if it's positive, I'm a far more productive human being than I ever was before.The friendships you make with men are much stronger than the way a typical female and female relationship is. Bromance is very real, and honestly is one of my favorite things about being a guy. Females are fickle in friendships. They go from treating you like you're their favorite person, to Being indifferent to talking shit, then back to favorite person.. And that's if they care about you. Being female, guys make good friends, but it's difficult not to either think they are in it for the wrong reasons or that the relationship is perceived as being romantic on some level by others.As long as you're respectful, I'll  answer any questions you have about either gender perspective.

As it has been brought up by others in this thread, retinoscopy (streak) is the definitive (currently) way optometrists and ophthalmologists calculate prescriptions in cases where verbal communication is not possible, i.e. babies, infants, young children, mentally challenged or elderly patients. Retinoscopy works by shinning a retinscope into a patient's eye and observing the reflex of light that is reflected back. This system is built on the optics found in the eye, no different to the optics of a camera lens. There are two movements we expect to see, they are an against or with movement. An against movement means you need a negative lens correct (myopia) and a with movement means you need a positive lens to correct (hyperopia). You can also calculate astigmastism with retinoscopy, and this is where it becomes difficult. In the hands of a capable operator, retinoscopy is far more accurate than any modern autorefractor (for now) as operators have trained many years to use a retinoscope. The problem with current auto-refractors is that they do not account for accommodation in the eye; think when you switch between looking at something far away like the horizon and then looking at your phone quickly. Do you sometimes notice it takes a microsecond or two to adjust? Thats your accommodation working, your eye lens physically changes shape in order for you to see your phone clearly; think chaning focal lenghts on a camera zoom. Accommodation breaks down around 40years old progressively until around 60 and this is why people need reading glasses. I digress. Auto-refractors are still a very important screening tool in helping aid reaching your final prescription, however the results are not generally completely reliable. I hope that helps.Source: OD.

Speaking as a pre-registration optometrist in England I will try and explain why this is the case as best i can.Subjective results are generally better because we must control a process we call \"accommodation\"  i.e. the ability young individuals have to focus for near. Optics 101 also shows that you can use this additional focusing power to focus through some prescriptions, for example \"long sighted\" or plus prescriptions, this causes long term issues in patients because this requires effort and causes eyestrain. In children the ability to accommodate is very high. Trust me when I say it is much easier to relax this accommodation in someone who a.) Has less ability to do it and b.) Can understand subjectively when a lens makes no difference to their sight. These are both adult qualities, as a result we must do it differently for children. The way we generally do it is by relaxing the accommodation with drops called cycloplegics, these drugs then have side effects which then make subjective testing EVEN harder. For example it makes your pupils larger which can then cause glare which could be mistaken for blur. We must then use objective methods to determine a rough estimate of the prescription because the patient cannot operate subjectively, it is by no means more accurate. BUT that's not to say it is going to damage your child's sight, we tend to give these prescriptions simply to relax the child's eye muscles and allow for NORMAL ocular development. Normal ocular development shows that children tend to be slightly long sighted and become more short sighted until they have no prescription, this is normal because the larger your eye the more short sighted you become. It's obviously normal for your eyes to become larger as the body gets bigger. This is why we only correct gross long sightedness (we rarely intervene with short sightedness because glasses may not help much, specialist CLs are generally used for these children). As you can probably deduce now, it does not matter if we leave the child slightly long sighted because they have a large amount of accommodation, so the fact our prescriptions will be slightly off when obtained objectively (which they will be) will not be an issue. It's all about reducing the amount of long sightedness to a point which will not cause the patient to accommodate TOO much, which will then cause eyestrain and even lazy eyes (accommodation also stimulates the eyes to turn in as well). Lazy eyes are the worst case scenario in children undergoing ocular development, because the brain is still malleable or \"plastic\". Therefore, it can develop to IGNORE the visual information being sent by the lazy eye (therefore, the brain is avoiding double vision and blur) and cause very reduced vision in that eye in later life. In my experience, I generally prescribe long sighted prescriptions causing problems (for example lazy eyes) then use further tests to monitor whether the prescription has removed the lazy eye at future visits. I refer short sighted/ different prescriptions in each eye (anisometropia) to specialists to fit contact lenses etc. Some children also need patching to remove this dominance issue which is undertaken by other specialists. TLDR: we generally prescribe children to relax their \"accommodation\" to the point where it doesn't cause them any issues (lazy eyes/eyestrain). The long sighted child will see fine regardless of if a prescription is in place or not because their ability to accommodate through long sighted prescriptions is so good. Objective methods are not superior but are our only alternative. Prescribing for short sighted children or children with prescriptions which are different in each eye are more complex and require contact lens intervention. We prescribe for those children to slow the progression of short sightedness or to make the images formed by each eye more equal. Again, having the exact right prescription may not be possible for these children without subjective methods but we definitely allow the children's ocular development to be less affected by their incorrect prescription. The goal in prescribing for children is usually not to let them see clearly but to improve their ocular development.Phew, that's hard to explain in layman's terms.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 16, "stickied": false, "score": 12, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  2 16:16:53 2017", "ups": 12}, {"body": "There are two ways that I know of, one being retinoscopy, and other being teller cards.

The electrons certainly interact with each other. The charge of the inner ones shield the outer ones from the nucleus charge, and an electrons prevent any other electron from moving into their state. And in other situations, like say a free electron traveling, electrons can scatter off each other. But around the nucleus electrons in different states colliding or scattering off each other is not something that occurs.

Basically what SIEMs do is ingest a metric shit load of computer logs from many different sources (dhcp, dns, firewall etc) and based on user created rule sets corrolates these ingested logs into security events. These events are analyzed by analysts who then have all the corrolated logs to sift through to determine if an incident has occurred.  Its important to note that SIEMs themselves are not intrusion dection/prevention platforms (IDS/IPS) but analytical platforms by and large (they're also widely used for their log retention capabilities for things like HIPPA compliance). This means that with inner workings of ArcSight you still dont have the knowledge to breach systems because you still have firewalls and other systems to bypass. Those actual ID/PS systems are still the main blockades from intrusion into protected networks. The granularity of searches and pivot points is a SIEM platforms greatest strength, if the user created correlation rulesets are junk you aren't going to get a lot of value out of the platform. A general example might be a ruleset that fires when a user connects to a russian IP address. All logs associated with that traffic would be corrolated together and viewable within the event so you could analyze the traffic to see if its occuring as general user activity or if its surreptitious in nature. You could then very easily search all systems on feeding into your SIEM to see if any other endpoints are communicating with that IP (possibly due to an initial infection that has spread through the network). From there you could tune your firewalls to block communication with that IP if its seemed to be malicious or suspicious.This is a single example but rules can be configured for anything, like an event  can be made to fire off of port scanning followed by subsequent connection attempts, to see if a user account has attempted to authenticate a thousand times, any time someone pings an external location. If it created a log a SIEM can be granted visibility into it, this also includes things like visibility into suspicious files, tools, commands being executed, password modification activity etc etc etc etc. ArcSight grants enhanced visibility into network events, it's like the eye of sauron it looks around a bunch but still relies on walls to keep things out.Other popular SIEM platforms include Logrhythm, Splunk IBM's Qradar and Intel/Mcafee Nitro.

States vary wildly on how restrictive their concealed carry programs are, so just because there's some form of legal concealed carry doesn't mean that it's easily accessible by most residents.  Also, saying that machine guns are legal typically just means that they aren't explicitly illegal.  Machine guns are still tightly controlled at the federal level by the ATF.

They said he had around 1000 rounds, so that would be shooting at a 45% accurate rate.Yes, gun lovers, you can make the argument that he could have gotten these firearms on the black market, but the average person is not going to buy a fucking arsenal. Because, as far as we know, he was literally just an average person with a mental illness.Yes, the 2nd Amendment is clear, you have the right to bear arms, but what are you realistically going to do with an assault rifle? If you want home defense, I recommend a shotgun with a decent spray. If you want personal defense, I recommend a Glock 9mm, or some other handgun.And I get it, you don't want to be put on a list or database to register that you are a long gun owner, but maybe, just maybe, you need some accountability. No one is saying you can't have these weapons, and this is a very difficult issue to face, but there is no other reason than \"This is cool as fuck,\" that you could justify having a long rifle with automatic settings.Personally, I don't think folks should have access to firearms unless they go through local/state training, and become certified, like driving a car. Remember, there are states where you can purchase firearms from folks privately, and it is perfectly legal. Shit, my wife's twin niece and nephew got a big assed shotgun apiece for their 10th birthday.I think many folks do not understand the implications of firearm ownership, so let me flop some knowledge on you. In the military, in our military, you can literally not fire upon the enemy unless an officer assess the situation and you ~~get a verbal queue~~ have issued orders, or previously stated ROE to open fire. If you do not wait for an officers order, you will probably be dishonorably discharged or imprisoned. Why? There are very specific laws, and rules of engagement to be considered. Which brings me to my next point, how well do you know your local/state laws? Did you know in many states that a home intruder who is subdued by gunfire, and lives, can actually sue you if they did not have a lethal weapon on them, and sometimes you can be charged as well? That equals imprisonment for defending your own home.Now this assault was a true tragedy, developed by someone who knew what they were doing. And I look at these sort of events as a force of nature, because there is no one deterrent that could have prevented this. Would mitigated access to high powered rifles may have deterred this man? Maybe, guns on the black market are exceedingly expensive. Would mitigated access for folks with know mental illness' stopped this? Again, maybe, but then you start the debate on infringement of rights. Would an outright ban of automatic long guns have prevented this? This goes back to the fact that black market guns are not cheap, and I am sure you don't know a shady weapons dealer. This isn't Borderlands, you can just buy this shit at any Walmart **EDIT** I used Walmart as an example, but there are many local stores you can get this stuff at.In reality, there are many steps, we, as a nation can take, but never will. Guns are a hotbed issue for many folks, and the issue itself is literally sitting on a powder keg. This is one of those things that could cause a semi-Civil War if the government came for guns. So these tragic events will happen over and over, and nothing will be done, ever. Those of us alive right now think we could make a difference, but I'm here to tell you that this is such a complex issue for America. Bullets are in our bloodstream, and there are those that would rather fight than give up their weapons. I know perfectly rational people that change into rabid insanity when you mention gun control.

They'll point to mental illness, the fact the gunman had access to two planes, and other factors and claim he could've done as much damage or more with a vehicle, home-made bombs, etc.The truth of it is that he didn't use those things. He took advantage of our constitutional rights and the ease of access to long-guns and used them to commit the worst shooting in United States history.Until the pro-gun side can have an honest debate we will never come to a solution on this situation. Instead of yelling about mental illness our side should be talking about the pro's of accessible gun ownership vs the pro's of restrictions on firearm ownership, instead of deflecting to mental-illness or the dangers of vehicles.I like to consider myself a moderate. I consider the right to self-defense an intrinsic right that is enshrined in our constitution, but I can also admit that I'm not using an AR-15 for protection, I'm not using a 60 round drum magazine to stop someone from mugging me. Is it a great time to hit the range with these weapons? Absolutely, but does that \"fun-factor\" outweigh the social interest in protecting lives?No. It doesn't.Until the pro-gun side is ready to make some, perhaps necessary, concessions this country won't learn anything from this incident.Because, the truth of the matter is this psycho didn't use a handgun, he didn't use a shotgun, he used a precision semi-automatic rifle from a range that would exceed anything close to a reasonable distance where one would feel the need to defend themselves with a weapon.We have a right to self-defense, and I believe the right to own and carry a handgun sufficiently applies that right, but maybe it's time to admit that lives are more important than having fun at the range with an AR-15.

Make them stop.***And his protest did exactly what it was intended to do. It drew attention to police brutality. But this year is different.

My boss *will not* leave me alone at all and frankly I don't even want to come into work.It started innocently enough. We have skype at work so we can contact other employees throughout the company. He began messaging me and chatting with me throughout the day; just chatting about work and stuff that is going on. However, it has now progressed to him asking about personal things.  Compliments me on how chill and cool I am and hopes his daughter turns out like me. He will also ask me if I would get mad over something that his wife got mad over, and inevitably I don't agree with her side one hundred percent. He'll be like thank you I knew she was overreacting. Will ask me question about my relationship with my boyfriend, etc... I also don't wear makeup or dress up a lot when I'm at work (our work environment is laid back), but out of the office I do; I love wearing makeup and getting dressed up, but just don't want to spend the extra time for work to do it. He will message me periodically now how I should wear makeup for certain presentations and straighten my hair to work. Like seriously wtf. Then says thing like if I'm making you uncomfortable just let me know. And that he knows he's a leader and shouldn't be putting me in this position, but he can't help himself.To top it off though, he *literally* message throughout the day *NONSTOP.* Like every 5 minutes he's messaging me something and then if I don't respond in a timely manner he'll ask if he's annoying me. Or if I'm mad at him. Or if he's bothering me. Or how he hopes I still like him. How he hopes we're *still* good friends. I have a job where I need to concentrate for a decent period of time to get something done and I feel like I have completely lost that since he's started messaging me. It's like if I don't respond he gets mad at me. I feel like I'm getting behind on my own work to appease his appetite for speaking with me. Also, he started to get jealous of other guys taking my time at work. I have another coworker that asked me out to lunch twice. He's a great guy and super funny and friendly. My boss still talks about it 2 months later. About what I'm doing and how I better not be getting lunch with that coworker again as it is cutting into chatting time. He'll say it as a joke, but it legit seems like he's jealous over it. In addition, we're friends on snapchat and he now messages me after work. The only reason why we're friends on sc is that he was having issues with the app. So me and another coworker were helping him and then he asked us to add him. So we all added each other.Sooo now, he messages afterwork during the week and all weekend long. We had this one presentation that was coming up when he said I should be the one to serve out beverages that were being brought to everyone. Haha *hilarious* joke, but not a big deal; have heard those before. But then he snaptexts me about how I should adhere to the dress code of a short skirt and top... Another time he ended up saying that I looked like a girl that's been with 25 guys jokingly, then straight up asked how many people I've slept with. He said he would tell me his count and then I have to promise to tell him mine. I said no point blank repeatedly yet he kept asking. I finally snap and then tell him that's nobodies business but mine. He apologized and stated that he crossed the line and shouldn't ask that and how he really values our friendship and doesn't want to lose it. The last thing he does that annoys the shit out of me is that he insists on leaving work at the same time. Our work is flexible on when we can come and go. If I leave early he will too just to walk me out. If I stay later he will too just so we can walk out at the same time. If I take off a day, he will end up taking off for the rest of the day when he finds out. He says he has all this vacation time to burn, but yet will schedule time off and then still come in. The only time he ever seems to take off now is when I'm not at work. I know I should just straight up say no, I don't like this conversation. No, I don't enjoy talking with you nonstop. But my manager absolutely loves him and I'm terrified that I could lose my job and get reprimanded some way for this. Also I feel like I could potentially damage his life. He has a wife and kids so I would feel responsible for negatively impacting them anyway.Also it's embarrassing. I don't want my other coworkers to think I was getting favored for work I've done. I don't want to think that I was seducing the boss. I don't want them to look at me and see only the situation that happened. The boss is well liked around the office. This is my first real career job and I don't want to do anything that could jeopardize it. It just sucks. I never loved my job, but I enjoyed it and was good at it. Now I dread going into work and getting messaged by him all day. I hate seeing him now. I don't want to be his friend with the way he's been acting.

I\u2019d like to share why I made this decision because if I think women need to make fully informed decisions about what happens to their bodies. And please understand, this is NOT a critique plastic surgery or implants--they were just totally wrong for me and I hoping someone can learn from it. Then, it at least wasn't for nothing. I got my implants 10 years ago when I was 20 years old. Submuscular. Saline. I went from a 32A or B to a 32DD. I\u2019m 5\u20191 and about 110lbs (on a good day). At that time, a popular TV show was Nip/Tuck (an FX drama about a Miami plastic surgery practice). And the characters would always start a consultation by saying \u201ctell me what you don\u2019t like about yourself.\u201d 10 years ago, I could have written an entire book attempting to answer that question--there wasn't much that I did like about myself. Least of all, was my body: I HATED it as most women are, unfortunately, conditioned to do, starting at a very young age. I had also spent some of my teenage years being overweight (gotta love that \u2018Mercian diet) and I couldn't stop seeing myself that way, no matter how much weight I lost. But then when I was FINALLY thin enough, I thought my boobs had become too small. Never mind that I'm petite and 5\u20191 and was born to have tiny (but perky!) lil boobies. And, evolutionary biology studies have shown that what actually makes breasts attractive is the perkiness, NOT the size. Those were (obviously) not factors in my decision. Nevertheless, at first I really did enjoy all of the extra attention I got when my boobs were small-melon/large grapefruit-sized. But, as time went on, I realized I really don't want *that* kind of attention. Sometimes, I just want to go to a bar and be left the fuck alone. I don't like being stared at, I'd rather someone try to make eye contact with me, so the staring can at least be mutual. That thought had never once crossed my mind. I also failed to consider how difficult it would be for me to find bras--I have teeny tiny shoulders and my chest boulders needed to be supported against gravity but I rarely found a size 32DD bra with short enough straps. Having your bra strap continually slide off your shoulder is SO annoying, especially when it's for 10 goddamn years. And, I didn't think about the consequences it would have on my body. The extra weight made it more difficult for me to sit up straight and I've noticed gradually worsening back pain over the years. I also just feel like it's so much easier to breathe without that weight. Every time I gave someone a hug, I could  feel them in between me and the person I am hugging, it's kind of sad feeling like you can never get hugged as hard or as closely as you would like. I'm also a stomach sleeper for at least some of the night and when I had implants, I'd often wake up because it was uncomfortable. Every time I would lie on my back, they\u2019d drift down to the sides into my armpits-they didn\u2019t even look like boobs anymore when I was laying down--they looked more like weird armpit tumors. When I was upright, they caused a very deep divot in my armpit making it very difficult to shave without cutting myself. Ever done that without realizing it and put on deodorant? It's unforgettable. Also, when I was sweaty and I would move my arms, my armpits would make involuntarily armpit fart-noises. And think about the things you do that make you sweat. Yeah. That's. Totally. Attractive. When I\u2019d go an hour without wearing a bra, I was sore. I LOVE not having to wear a bra all the time anymore. When I would do yoga there were certain positions where they wound up right in my face and I felt like I couldn\u2019t really breathe, which is something you're kinda supposed to in yoga. Despite my practice of yoga, I'm not the most graceful human, so sometimes, when I ate, food would fall down my cleavage and I wouldn\u2019t find it until the end of the day when I changed into my pajamas. There were rare instances when I found something intact and delicious, like an M+M, but most of the time, it was just disgusting. When I had sex, I\u2019d have to explain to men why my breasts look and feel weird and overly firm and that it kind of hurts if they're touched a certain way (so please don't). Fantastic foreplay. Before, when I had my implants, my nipples felt cold more (I think because they were further away from my body) but now, they actually get warm and they're not irritated. Breast cancer runs in my family. So in 10 years, when I need a mammogram, the implants would have made it more difficult to detect cancer, not to mention way more painful. Not worth risking my life, even if it's a small risk. Implants also require maintenance, which means surgery every 10-15 years (20 if you're lucky), and more often if there are complications (such as capsular contracture). I never thought of any of that when I decided to get implants. And, surgery, is NOT cheap. That being said, it's one of the best things I've done for myself.

She calmly kept repeating to her mother that it was her life and her decision. When my grandmother said she wouldn't come to any wedding, my parents ended up just going to the courthouse.

Consider that when a man marries a woman with kids, if he is remotely decent (meaning not abusive and has a job) then he is seen as and lauded as a hero for 'stepping up to the plate' and taking on those kids. But when a woman marries a man with kids, she is seen as the evil step-mother by pretty much everyone at worst, and as a dumbo by her own friends and family at best. Why? Because the roles of mother and father are so different. All a step-father has to do, is be a regular father; stuff like financially provide, dispense fatherly advice now and then, and discipline (but not hard! can't be abusive), lay the law down with the kids and maintain order in the house. But a mother's role is much more intense and hands-on. You will be required to do mothering work for those kids (including most if not all cooking, cleaning, laundry, doctor visits, school visits, and so on and so forth), and probably also financially provide for them, you will probably also be expected to have a job. And do all this without the normal love and affection children show their mothers, because real talk these kids are going to hate you for a while.Why? Because on top of that, it's a situation where their own mother will lose custody of them and you were the one the one to instigate it: >I was the one that first suggested that we try to take custody of the childrenSomeone is going to tell those kids at some point that it was you who suggested that you and their dad seek custody. Let me tell you....they are going to feel disturbed and upset at being pulled from their mother (even though it is a neglect and abusive situation) but when they find out it was YOU who suggested taking them from her and not their dad, they are going to absolutely hate you for *years*. So off the rip tell your fiance he must not tell them this ever, and hopefully he hasn't already told anyone else.Also consider that the suffering they have thus far endured at the neglect and abuse from their mother has psychologically damaged them and will affect how they interact with other children for some time to come, especially including any future children (I know you said you didn't want your own but you may change your mind) you might have with your fiance. Whether you guys get full custody of them or not, your fiance needs to make sure his kids get proper therapy and treatment for what they have been through.Sooooooo long story short, after 48 years of marriage the dust has settled and my older siblings love my mother and care about her and see her somewhat as a mom.

The mother currently has custody of the children and we watch the children one weekend night a week.  6 months ago the mother quit her job and has refused to find a new one, stopped paying her rent and her and the kids were evicted recently.  The mother is also mentally unstable, with several serious breakdowns that resulted in her being admitted to the hospital's psych ward for several days multiple times in recent months.  The children are being neglected, being forced to do chores all day without any time for fun and relaxation after school, they are malnourished because their mother doesn't pack them lunch or give them lunch money for school, and she insists that they need to be medicated for ADHD (which they don't actually have).This puts my fianc\u00e9 in a position where he has a valid claim to custody of the children to make a better life for them.  I was the one that first suggested that we try to take custody of the children, I've never been interested in having my own biological children and always liked the prospect of adopting.  Here is the problem: I told my mother (who is upset that I'm with a man that has two children) that he may get custody of the children in the very near future.  She then began insulting him and saying how staying with him when he has custody of the children is going to \"close a lot of doors\" in my life and \"prevent me from being happy.\"  She also said \"don't let the kids get attached to you so that...\" not finishing that thought because she knew she would offend by by finishing it and saying \"when you leave him it won't be as hard on the kids\".   What she's said to me has been really hurtful towards me and has made me very confused about how my fianc\u00e9 and I should proceed.  Leaving him is out of the picture because he is my soul mate, but the things my mother said haunt me every time I think about the fact that I hope to adopt these children in the future.

I'm looking for advice if you have any,This morning I was finishing up work when two women came in and sat down next to me. For context, they were black women and I am a white women.They were talking loudly enough for me to hear, and were discussing the shooting that has just taken place in Las Vegas. They were discussing the shooter, and a lot of the discussion revolved around race and the media. Soon after they arrived, I began packing up to leave. The women assumed I was leaving was because of their discussion. They started whispering about me, calling me an ignorant white women. They said I refused to acknowledge the truth and it was white privilege that allows me to do so. I don't think they intended for me to hear this. I honestly strained to listen because I could tell they were talking about me.On one hand, I get that they've probably dealt with a lot of stuff like this in their lives that I can't even imagine. Being a black person in America is obviously much more difficult than being a white person, and maybe what they assumed I was doing was something that has happened before. I can't put myself in their shoes.On the other hand, it was really upsetting to have those assumptions put on me. I hate that they assumed I was some racist, bigoted individual just because I'm a white women who happened to be leaving the shop as they were having the conversation. I also felt as if I was put in a situation where I couldn't defend myself. Obviously I didn't want to start a public altercation with strangers, but also anything I said to defend myself would come across as defensive and reactionary. I left without saying anything, but this interaction is still weighing on my shoulders later in the day.

Ever since I was little I had body image issues. I asked my dad why my stomach stuck out when I was 5. By 3rd grade I was counting calories. I'd never been overweight a day in my life, but I was terrified of becoming fat. When puberty hit I was smaller than everyone else, \"petite\", and I hated it. Guys would say \"you have no boobs\" and stuff like that. At age 19 or 20 I started an antipsychotic called Zyprexa and went from 5'4\" and 105 lbs to 130 lbs. I got a lot of mean comments from girlfriends (\"you got chunky, etc\") and weird sexual comments from guy friends about my butt and legs and such. During this time I was also raped. I went off zyprexa shortly after I was raped and dropped the weight in probably two or three months. Ever since then I can't eat. I eat maybe 1,200 calories on a good day, 200 on a bad day. I'm at about 100 lbs. and still my stomach isn't flat. I wish it were, I guess, but I know I'm not fat. I don't look in the mirror and see an obese person or anything, but I'm coming to realize that I probably see myself as bigger than I am--maybe, then again, I'm just used to my weight?My mom is really worried I guess. I come home from work and I don't eat. When I do eat a \"big\" meal (500 calories or so?) I can't digest it. It sits like a rock in my stomach for hours until it finally goes away and it's horribly uncomfortable.Also had my thyroid checked recently and I'm mildly hypo (just no weight gain)--could that have anything to do with it? I feel fine usually, just tired (maybe from depression). Had my iron levels and stuff checked and I'm *slightly* low, but so are a lot of people. I'm sorry. I guess I shouldn't make excuses for not eating. I know I should eat, but it's horrifically uncomfortable to eat. It's also a sensory issue with autism--I'll stick with one food for a long time because it's all I can handle sensory-wise. One month or so all I ate was tomatoes basically. Breakfast was tomatoes, lunch was tomatoes, dinner was tomatoes. Tl;dr: I don't know what my eating \"disorder\" stems from or if it's even a disorder. I have no appetite, food tastes and feels horrible to me and I can't seem to digest properly. I've had issues with food and body image in the past but I know I'm not fat.

It sounds like you have a lot of guilt and anxiety from the experience, and I'll try and share some ways to process through those and maybe feel a bit better.    Guilt - part of your guilt could be from the stigma around ONS's. You were two consenting adults that decided to have a good time together, and there's nothing to feel guilty about that. You say that this is outside of your usual actions, but that doesn't mean it's bad because of that. This experience hasn't made you any less valuable, or any less worthy of respect. Even if you'd never do it again this experience hasn't marked or defined any part of who you are.   You also may feel guilty because you did not use protection. The blame for this is partly on you, but your partner was more so to blame because every sexually active guy should have condoms on hand and use them. Realize that many things led to this happening, and try to learn from them. This was your first ONS, so you weren't really prepared. You both had some drinks, and you have an IUD which both make you less likely to use a condom. Those things are ok - you just need to learn and move forward.    Anxiety - the main part of this is probably a worry about diseases. Most STDs / STIs are curable, and almost all of them are treatable and manageable. Having an STD is extremely common, and having one doesn't make you a lesser partner. No matter how the test comes back you are still valuable and deserving of love and respect.    If you really feel like crap tonight then please treat yourself and unwind. Take a bath, read a book, eat a bit of candy, whatever you can do to brighten your day.

Through hospital beds, bailing him out, being there for him in all aspects- money, love, financially.. This was my 1st everything. I was told he loved me. We were together everyday. We talked about marriage from day ONE. I wouldn't date to date, he knew this. He repeatedly assured me his parents would be accepting. We had a friendship too.The other night, he left my crib (I live on my own) in a panic. We were together the whole week. He borrowed my phone and credit card saying he'd be right back. Hours passed, I needed my stuff back. I called my phone and a female answered MY phone asking who I WAS. She said they were soon to be engaged, met 2 months ago, and to never contact him. She appeared to his house on a surprise visit because his mother is sick.I took an Uber to his house with 3 of my girls to get my stuff back. I saw them together and her mouth is now busted open. I panicked, I went into shock, I hit her repeatedly. She is his age, no charges have been pressed. His parents came out, mines pulled up to the scene. Our parents talked it out, informed them his son is not truthful and this was more serious than they think, and agreed for us (me and him) to never talk again.20 minutes after I basically beat her, he came back to my place. Hysterically crying, as was I. He couldn't even look at me. He said he doesn't love her and its not official. This went on for hours. He took the last piece of me when he walked out that door the next morning. I haven't seen him since. He'll call me under private (his phone is lost until whenever, hence he was borrowing mine) cry for a minute, hang up. Say his heart hurts, hang up. I am devastated. I feel sick to my stomach. He had no intentions of leaving me, we talked all day everyday if we weren't together. I told him my dreams, my future. I can't even eat. I been self-sedating myself. This is so painful. She is from some village in Pakistan, has little-no education, so all she keeps saying to me is its her future husband (oh, and doesn't want to marry him until he gets sober since he's a high functioning alcoholic, finishes x amount of school, and makes xxxx a month LOL) and just this, this, and that.

Do not be fooled by people saying they are defending the right to vote. This 'referendum' is against Spanish constitutional law and even the rules which govern the regional government of Catalonia. The supreme and constitutional courts have so declared it repeatedly, and instructed its prohibition. (2) Not only is the 'referendum' illegal, but its arrangements violate all minimum requirements for a clean vote as per international conventions, including i.a. people over-voting multiple times in different locations, having ballots filled with votes in advance, votes being made without proper identification, etc. It is a mock propaganda event designed to attract attention. (3) Be not mislead by the false impression created by extreme pro-independence supporters that a supermajority of Catalans are in favour of independence. Over 7.5m people live in Catalonia (including children who don't have voting rights), of which at least 30% and at most 50% are pro independent, having at least half of Catalans feeling also proudly Spanish too. Worth to note that many of the radicals among them are children of migrants from other Spanish autonomous regions such as Andaluc\u00eda. The most extreme radicals stand at around 300k+ CUP party voters, however they are extremely active in propaganda and highly over-represented in parliaments due to the design of the Spanish political system and special rights granted to Catalonia during democracy and by the Spanish constitution, which they now ironically violate and reject. (4) Spain is one of the most federalist countries in Europe, split into 17 Autonomous Regions of which the Basque Country and Catalonia have substantial special rights vs others granted to them ('derechos historicos'). Catalonia has probably more autonomy and self-government than any other EU region and possibly some states in the US. This includes for instance healthcare, education, police or also justice; and it is one of the wealthiest regions in Europe, to a large extent thanks to the investments made into it by the whole of Spain to foster its economic growth for decades (during but even prior to Spanish democracy). Independence supporters were much more moderate when for instance Barcelona wanted Spain's support for the 1992 olympics. (3) The two main arguments presented by the independence supporters are: - Catalonia would better off economically without Spain as there would not be internal fiscal transfers to poorer regions ('Spain robs us'). Interesting to see this is the same argument used by pro-brexiters. Think we all know the evidence behind that statement (remember the higher contributions to NHS).- Catalonia is 'different'. It has a distinct language, culture and history which is incompatible with the rest of Spain. I believe Spain's plural society is one of our strengths and something to be celebrated. Diversity makes us stronger not weaker, and arguably people from the South and North of Spain or the country's islands have less in common and still are proud Spaniards. Pro-independence supporters present themselves as the champions of democracy against a central 'authoritarian' government (whose job is, among other things, to make all citizens respect the law), but these are the same people who break the law, burn Spanish flags and whistle the Spanish anthem, socially denounce, finger point and chase non-independence Catalan citizens and civil servants like judges, town mayors and others simply not willing to break the law, and even manipulate children for their cause. I feel equally proud of being from Madrid, Spanish and European. We are citizens of a globalized world and should think of finding common ground rather than ways to divide us. (5) The formation of the Spanish modern state took place in 1492. We have a longer history living together than the majority of countries.(6) International support for the referendum has come from personalities such as Maduro and Assange. Nationally it is supported for instance by Arnaldo Otegui convicted for being part of ETA's terrorist group. (7) I am against any form of violence. At the same time I believe nobody is above the law, and law enforcement should be pursued. A clear distinction should be made between those who abide by the rules and those who don't, and changes in law or constitution need to be processed through legal democratic means of parlamentar\u00edan, representative democracy and referenda which are legit and with guarantees. No 2-4m minority can impose its nationalistic view on over 43m+ other Spaniards, and especially not over the other 3-4m of Spanish-feeling Catalans among them, who are being pushed to break the law, lose their Spanish nationality and EU citizenship. (8) Both Spanish and regional Catalonian politicians are to blame for the status quo. Over decades the central left and right winged governments have ceded power to regional government in exchange for their support to govern with majority governments. The regional government of Catalonia has abandoned its traditional moderate stance in favor of extremist populist views, which have impregnated the educational system with ideological concepts. They have turned their back on what matters to people more which is economic growth and employment, and rather focus on creating division and conflict. Both have failed the mandate of the people. (9) The future: I am in favor of negotiating a solution to this conflict. But this process needs to start by respecting the rule of law, and allowing everyone to have some sort of say, including the other 43m Spaniards+Catalans who respectfully feel that Catalonia is part of their country like their own region or the one next door, and which they co-own to a higher o lower degree. (10) I have many friends in Catalonia (some are pro-independence). Many of my family ancestors come from there. It is a beautiful region, one of the best I know. Truly hope we can find ways to agree that together we are stronger.I imagine some may agree or disagree with the above and would respect that. But since I have been asked by friends from all around the globe about my view, I decided to share my thoughts in a more thorough manner on this sad day for my country.

This was actually the first concert she had ever been two.Shoreline is one of those venues that has two levels of seating and a third grass lawn in the way back.  It is a great venue, but the lawn is way back and you often get a lot of wind coming in off of the bay.  We get there and I realize I forgot a blanket or anything to sit on.  I felt a bit embarrassed I didn't remember this. So we just plop down the lawn and make the best of it.

I said no, but invited him to sit with us anyway.  We had a decent view of the projection screens.He stopped me and then pulled out this stack of tickets.  He handed us a couple of 5th row tickets and said \"These are from the band\".  Apparently it was a common thing for Tom Petty to buy out one of the first 10 rows and have one of his aides hand them out to people in the far back.  They wanted make sure all of their fans got a chance to be up close no matter what ticket they could afford.It sounded like this was common for the band.  So I'm sure there are others out there who had a similar experience.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2526, "stickied": false, "score": 226, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 00:55:58 2017", "ups": 226}], "subreddit": "news", "selftext": "", "libertarian": 0.19720447060000001, "id": "73uxqb", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Tom Petty found unconscious, rushed to hospital", "num_comments": 1823, "conservative": 0.185807094, "pinned": false, "score": 31941, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 9730, "permalink": "/r/news/comments/73uxqb/tom_petty_found_unconscious_rushed_to_hospital/", "submission_time": "Mon Oct  2 23:10:32 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "And yet Jon Bon Jovi continues to breath.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1360, "stickied": false, "score": -10, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  2 23:55:58 2017", "ups": -10}, {"body": "Man, this is a real Heartbreaker.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5094, "stickied": false, "score": -2, "submission_time": "Tue Oct  3 03:00:18 2017", "ups": -2}, {"body": "In related news, TMZ asked singer Sam Smith what he thought about the music icon's sudden passing.

There is no legitimate reason semi auto, hi cap rifles like an AR-15 should be legal for civilians. Aside from recreation, they serve no purpose other guns couldnt fill. you dont carry a long gun as your every day carry and home defense can be accomplished with a handgun or shotgun. the only difference is that these rifles are much better at shooting off many more rounds, much faster- which is something no civilian should ever need. And while i think we can all agree guns are fun to shoot, a hobby this dangerous needs to be restricted. I'm not saying we should ban all guns. I'm saying we should move semi auto rifles like AR15s into a more controlled category. maybe the same category as machine guns, which are extremely hard to get. This obv wont stop mass shootings since handguns can be just as deadly, but i see no downside and anything that would make a shooting like this less successful is a good thing. and yes, we need to have better mental health treatment but that can be nearly impossible to find and treat. finding these people before would be ideal but also extremely hard, so regulating the guns they use seems like a better option. Also, yes, criminals will likely still get guns from mexico or something, but gang members arent usually the ones involved in mass shootings of innocent civilians. most mass killings are done with legal weapons anyways. *the police reports are of a semi auto rifle. he was likely using an AR with bump fire, as shown by [fps russia here](https://youtu.be/I6BFarrICWs?t=53s), which allow you to shoot as fast as the videos were showing.

I'm a phlebotomist for a blood bank (not the Red Cross though) and I'll tell you the same thing I tell all of my first time donors:> You fucking rock, dude.> Even just having the idea of coming in and donating is awesome and I'm so proud of people like you. I have been doing this for quite a while and I always get excited when I have a first time donor. It's fun! With one unit of whole blood, you've saved two to three people today. That's amazing!> Some tips for other first timers:> Eat well before hand. Having something in your stomach helps tremendously. 9 times out of 10, when someone has a reaction, they'll admit to not eating before hand.> Drink a ton of water, too, especially if you don't always drink water. It really helps with feeling well, but it also helps blood flow and makes the donation quicker.> I know it's hard, but try not to think about it. Bring a book, play on your phone, have a friend to talk to. I don't care. But the more nervous you are, the rougher it gets. I like to chat with my first time donors during the donation but it isn't always possible. However, if you tell me you're super nervous, I'm going to go out of my way to make sure you're comfortable.> Don't forget to squeeze the ball! If you have cold hands, ask for a hot pack. They're lovely.> If something doesn't feel right, please speak up. This is super important. I don't know what you're feeling, and sometimes I can tell by looking at you that something is wrong, but not always. If the needle hurts when it's in the vein, that's wrong. If you're feeling fuzzy or your hearing just got wonky, that's not right. The quicker you tell me, the quicker I'll be able to fix it.> If you have had bad experiences with phlebotomist before or if you have bad veins or if you're just uncomfortable with the whole idea, don't be afraid to let your phlebotomist know. A good phlebotomist won't be offended, and a really good phlebotomist will make sure you're comfortable 100% of the process.> When you're done, sit up slowly. Get used to being upright again before you stand up. Dangle your legs over the side of your chair. Take your time. There is no rush! Don't bend over and stand up suddenly. If you drop something, have someone else pick it up for you. Stick around for the full 15 minutes, and grab a snack. Something salty is preferable, to replace the 150mg of sodium that you lost. A whole blood donation burns 600 calories, so eat a big meal the day of your donation. Your body deserves the extra care.> You guys are awesome and I'm so proud of all you blood donors. For what it's worth, everyone involved in the blood industry loves what they do and loves being involved with it. (At least, all of the ones I've worked with, but again, I don't work for the Red Cross) You really are making a difference in someone's life and we appreciate it so much! I love working with you all and hope you all have wonderful experiences donating blood.> Editing this to say holy good god guys I did not expect gold. Thank you! If anyone ever has any questions about donating blood or anything that happens in the blood industry, let me know!

The explosion, which sent 50 meter flames into the air, destroyed a two-hectare wooded area. The NEB said the delay in releasing the report was caused by an \"administrative error\", when an employee left without transferring the file over. **The Peace River Mainline pipeline, built in 1968, had ruptured six times and leaked on 17 occasions until 2014. The line ruptured in 2009 due to corrosion.*** 2009: On 29 September, an Enbridge crude oil pipeline, Line 2, leaked at Mile Post 474.7335, immediately downstream of the Odessa pump station near Odessa, Saskatchewan. The leak occurred at a crack within a shallow dent at the 6 o\u2019clock position on the pipe. There were indications of gouging associated with the dent. The release occurred in a low lying, densely vegetated marsh. **Approximately 175 cubic meters of crude oil was released**, of which most was recovered.

If we are to start to simply follow whatever people call themselves  despite our personal feelings on the matter.

There are so many variations of preferred pro-nouns already how can we even be expected to remember them all let alone who they are and aren't associated with?    This growing trend may have popularly used ones but I've noticed more and more people just making up their own.     It's going to become impossible to get right even for die hard supporters of this.2.   What of the absurdities?   I have met not  one, two, or three but four people who have claimed their gender is angel/angelic.   You read that right angel.   These four were all separate occasions none even claimed to be otherkin or anything of the sort.    All claimed to be angels in gender and expected people to refer and respect them as such.Now, what am I suppose to do in that situation?   If I deny their divinity  and accept Xer,  shkle,  (yes really)  than I am special pleading for Xer, shkle, and others that are on my personal approved list.     I have no evidence based reason to accept that Shelly is a Xer anymore than Robert is a angel.So what exactly is even a liberal minded person like myself to do?  I don't want to be a asshole  but I can't give special  treatment to some and deny others the same.   I most certainly cannot reasonably be expected to accept them all including the insane ones like the angelic gender claimers.    This isn't even a slippery slope position I am taking as I've already encountered what is at the end of the slope.
