Thank you kind stranger, but right now there are people affected by the hurricanes who need that money more than I need internet points. Here is a link to [Unicef's Puerto Rico page.](https://www.unicefusa.org/donate/just-28-can-help-family-puerto-rico/33002?utm_campaign=2017_misc&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=0178/2/_Google&utm_content=PuertoRico&ms=cpc_dig_2017_misc_0178/2/_Google_PuertoRico&initialms=cpc_dig_2017_misc_0178/2/_Google_PuertoRico)I work in the health insurance industry. For the record I do support Single Payer, but I want to highlight a nuanced issue that has been lost in these dicussions and where I think a critical flaw still exists.Here is a simple thought experiment: **How is health insurance different from auto insurance?**You don't envoke your car insurance every time you change your oil, get gas, or get a timing belt changed. Why? **Because you buy insurance to cover catastrophic failures, not basic maintenance**. Because of this, you often shop around when looking for a service and mechanics have their prices printed on the walls. You can easily learn how much a given service will cost from mechanic to mechanic.**Health Insurance is no longer insurance, it has become synonymous with health care**. You can't walk into a dentist and check the price of a filling on the wall, you need to talk to the doctor directly and ask about what kind of insurance they accept. This is by no means the doctor's fault, the health insurance companies did everything they could to ingrain themselves in the process. But because of their influence, you have no idea what you are going to pay for any given service and you are locked into using certain doctors.Now, I understand the argument that people don't \"shop\" for a surgeon while having a heart attack, but I think that argument also hints at another issue: the dual nature of a medical professional in America. **Is a doctor a public servant or a business owner?** Right now it's both, but skewed towards a buisness. As a child I always lumped doctors, firefighters, and the police into the same mental bucket. These are people who are here for \"the greater good\"; they help you when you need it. I would hope a doctor would save my life for free if I suddenly collapsed in front of him. I would not expect the same from a mechanic or IT tech. Why? Because there is a moral responsibility one takes on when they become a doctor (a Hippocratic oath one might say?). Again, maybe that is just a naive part of my childhood, but I still carry a part of that belief today. My heart surgeon is not going to try to swindle me, they are going to try to save me. A doctor shouldn't have to worry about price matching and running tv ads. They shouldn't have to bargain with an insurance company for every little thing, or risk losing that pool of patients. The reason doctors have to overcharge on everything these days is specifically because of the way health insurance has ingrained itself. They have to charge $3000 knowing they are going to get $300.So, do I support Single Payer? Sure, it's better then what we have now. But I don't think it's a silver bullet. The entire health insurance industry is currently too involved with doctors and replacing your insurance with government insurance is only half the issue. Until we can separate *insurance* from *health care*, things are still going to be overly complicated and expensive.  Should all doctors become government employees like police and firemen? I don't know, that would create a whole new can of worms. If doctors operate as private businesses, then we need a standard pricing structure that doesn't involve insurance (not many insuance companies cover LASIK, and look how easy it is to shop around for the right surgeon). If we don't want to bar the poor from preventive and emergency care, then we would want health care to be a simple human right, and at that point doctors are basically government employees. I suspect we're heading for a blend of the two, but America will be slow to accept the idea of giving out care as a right.I just want to dispell the \"greedy doctor\" narrative that floats around sometimes. If a doctor acts like a used car salesmen and charges ridiculous prices, it's because the healtg insurance industry has forced them to. Health insurance needs to be more like auto insurance for Single Payer to really work.

(Universal =/= single-payer. Universal simply means that everyone has it.)The disagreement primarily comes over *how to achieve* said Universal Healthcare.

I oppose the government too willingly stepping in because1) I've used government healthcare before and its inefficiency is why I'm still living in constant pain. 2) Our country has 330,000,000 people. Larger than the next first world country by something like 100,000,000. Yet ~40% pay net-negative taxes. How do you plan to pay for this? Edit: Good god people, just fucking google it.

Can you imagine scaling that for our size? Correction: [Canada isn't going broke but it does have an average wait time of over four months. I was mistaken.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/06/13/if-universal-health-care-is-the-goal-dont-copy-canada/amp/)4) The ACA has been a complete disaster for my family. Why would I ever trust the government managing my healthcare again? Those are the big four reasons. Most people that disagree with the idea of it will probably cite one of those four reasons as why. I would *love* a system like Canada's but the fact is America is simply too fucking big to do it that way. Not unless you jack up taxes, which will affect mostly the people who already can afford their own healthcare so that kind violates the whole idea of capitalism and freedom. If you simplify the tax code and actually get people off of the government's welfare system and into the workforce and paying taxes *maybe* we can make government healthcare work. In the meantime, I would prefer we strip away limitations on insurers competing across the country and eliminate the stupid fucking ban on buying drugs from Canada.

Last year, we got 6 of those NES classics in stock. Everyone and their mother wanted one so we naturally sold out within 2 minutes. A customer returned one and the receiving lady, who we'll call Barbara, had to re-inventory it and put it back on the shelf. Barbara has two grandkids and knew that they wanted to get their hands on this NES classic. The rule at our store is the item in question has to be on the shelf for 15 minutes before an employee can purchase it. Knowing this, Barbara sets it on the shelf in it's proper location, sets a timer on her phone for 15 minutes, then goes to the cafe to get a bite to eat while she waits.15 minutes runs up, Barbara runs back and purchases the NES since no one had bought it yet. She didn't use her employee discount or store credit card to buy it. She left no traceable evidence that she was the one who purchased it. A week later, Barb gets pulled into the store managers office and he tells her she's being \"let go\" for buying the NES. She asks how they knew she bought it and why they were firing her for it when she left it on the shelf for the required amount of time. They told her \"This is a high demand item that we aren't getting a lot of. Guests come as our first priority when it comes to things like this\". She was essentially fired for something that she didn't even do wrong. The worst part about it was that they caught her by reviewing the surveillance footage of the self check out lanes and saw her buy it.Luckily for Barbara, she came back to the store a few days after she was fired and essentially blackmailed the store manager into giving her job back, threatening legal action for wrongful termination. She told him she had already filed a complaint with the district manager who wasn't very fond of the store manager to begin with. She ended up getting her job back and now still works at our store.

The boss (kinda new) was a die hard Hillary supporter, fired him literally within minutes after noticing the Trump sticker on the truck. It kind of worked out in the long run, because he fired a guy strictly because he didn't share his political view. So everyone put in a 1 week notice with HR at the same time which made upper management show up the next morning. So upper management fired him, and brought back the guy he fired. I saw the old boss last year, he works as a shift manager at a kind of fast food place. So he went from making at least $85k (that was the min pay for his position) a year to probably less than $32k a year, all because he didn't like someone's political choice.

Most rides were still open, and the park's later reputation for danger had not yet developed. In 1982, the deaths of two visitors within a week of each other and ensuing permanent closure of one ride took place, but that hardly dampened the flow of crowds.[16] The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in summer 1984 and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the lawsuits.* The sleds were a large factor in the injuries. A stick that was supposed to control speed led, in practice, to just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as \"death awaits\".* A skateboard park briefly existed, near the ski area's ski school building, but closed due to poor design after a season. Bowls were separated by pavement, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine Weird NJ saying that the \"skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed\".* Super Go Karts: The karts were meant to be driven around a small loop track at a speed of about 20 mph (32 km/h) set by the governor devices on them. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging tennis balls into them, and they were known to do so for parkgoers. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine car ride became a chance to play bumper cars at 50 mph (80 km/h), and many injuries resulted from head-on collisions. Also, the engines were poorly maintained, and some riders were overcome by gasoline fumes as they drove.* Super Speedboats: These were set up in a small pond, known by staff to be heavily infested with snakes.* In the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a complete vertical loop...The resulting slide, called the Cannonball Loop, was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered a hundred dollars to test it.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 6720, "stickied": false, "score": 22, "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 22:01:59 2017", "ups": 22}, {"body": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_ParkAction Park in New Jersey.

Translating to this to ppb gives us a uranium abundance of 0.077 ppb.Now, we find the approximate number of atoms in the sun. The mass of a hydrogen atom is 1.674e-27 kg and the mass of a helium atom is 6.6465e-27 kg. The relative abundance of hydrogen and helium are 0.75 and 0.25, respectively. So the average mass of an atom in the sun is 0.75 * 1.674e-27 + 0.25 * 6.6465e-27= 2.917e-27 kg.

It's more than 1.5 x the mass of Pluto. This is, of course, nothing compared to the sun's total mass, but it is definitely not negligible. It is nearly impossible that all these atoms go through the entire sun's lifetime without at least a part of them taking part in a fission reaction.

He did not mention, though, that the plan would also eliminate the personal exemption of $4,050 per person. For a mother with two kids, the $12,150 in lost exemptions would more than offset the higher standard deduction. Nor did Pence point to the proposed increase in the bottom tax rate, from 10% to 12%. So until Congress specifies how big the child tax credit will be, it\u2019s not clear how taxpayers on the lower rungs of the economic ladder would fare.Doubling standard deduction is probably the only thing GOP can claim is helpful to the middle class, and the personal exemption bit basically negates that. Just flagging as a reminder for folks.[EDIT: The child tax credit can also help compensate for the loss of personal exemption. The standard deduction of $12,000 would be a moderate increase over the ~$10K of old standard deduction + personal exemption, and a child tax credit of ~$1,500 (totally hypothetical number, no hard claims yet AFAIK) would offset the loss of the $4,000 dependent exemption, _at the 12% tax bracket_. At a higher bracket, that $4,000 exemption might instead be worth $1,000 or more, which the credit would no longer offset (unless it's increased further).Moreover, we also have the following things to worry about as well:1. Tax bracket increase from 10% to 12%2. Shifts/consolidations in the brackets themselves 3. State/local tax exemption elimination4. Elimination of other deductions (presumably, most would now be taking standard deduction instead of itemized)Whether or not this tax proposal can ultimately be called a tax cut for the middle class hinges on _all these factors_. It's important that we don't double-count one benefit as offsetting/paying for multiple other things at the same time.][EDIT 2: A [much, much richer analysis from the Tax Policy Center](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/preliminary-analysis-unified-framework/full) of the tax plan.

The issue is how we treat appreciated assets.When we think of the estate tax, we often think of the estate making a large cash gift to the heirs. But this is rarely the case. If I am 50 and have $100m (a pittance compared to the multibillion dollar fortunes in some families), I know I have more money than I'll ever need. I also know I don't need to wait until I die to set my kids up for life. So what do I do? I set up a trust. Now because the trust is in my child's name, it is subject to gift taxes, which kick in when I hit my lifetime giving limit which is itself the estate tax floor. So why give now instead of later? If I play my cards right, the trusts income can go untaxed. Through the power of compound interest, the $1M trust I set up is worth far more when I eventually die. This is the same principal that many retirement accounts operate under. The second issue is possibly even more egregious, although admittedly there are good reasons to have it: step up basis. But first, what is basis? Most people know that investments are taxed under capital gains rules. In general, capital gains are taxed on the difference between the sale price (amount realized) and the purchase price (basis).Say instead of 1M cash, I set aside for my child 1M in my company stock (this is very likely if I also want my children to have an interest in a family company). So 1M basis. But when I die, the stock is worth 20m. Normally, there would be 19m capital gains. But not with step up basis!I give my child the stock and they have their basis \"stepped up\" to 20m. Now they pay taxes on any new gain. So say the stock is worth 25m when they sell. They are taxed for 5m. No one ever pays tax on the 19m.The problem becomes even worse with real estate because I can deduct from my basis for depreciation. So a building I bought for 1M may have a basis of 500k. (In some ways this makes sense because a 20 yr old building may very well be worth less than a new one).So why do we have stepped up basis? Well one reason is we don't want to hit a giftee with tax. Imagine you inherit your father's action figure collection. If you needed to pay taxes on it, you might end up having to sell part of the collection to cover the taxes. There are also appraisal issues. Sometimes it's hard to know what a goods original basis was 40 years ago.

In my experience, law enforcement officers aren't really great at explaining the legal challenges and requirements in order for the State to file charges.  Most importantly, it is imperative to convey that none of this is the victim's fault and the victim did nothing wrong and make sure that the victim has access to any potential resources they need. Our system is not perfect and while it may not seem right, accused individuals have rights too that prosecutors have an ethical obligation to uphold. I cannot count the number of cases where I absolutely believed an individual committed a crime, but ultimately could not file charges because there simply was not enough admissible evidence to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.  I would encourage you to reach out to your local prosecuting attorney/district attorney's office and request to meet with the prosecutor who made the decision not to file.

I'm angry. I'm concerned. And I don't know if I did the right thing. Any suggestions, support, or personal experiences is very much needed. Not a few hours ago, I was on a crowded subway platform waiting for my train to arrive. As per usual I'm blasting music through my headphones spacing out until I hear someone yelling over my music. I turn and I see a youngish couple (late teens early 20's). The guy is in this girl's face screaming. I'm not using this term as an exaggeration, I could hear him through sound proof headphones. This girl is reacting how anyone would in this situation. The girl is upset, she is close to tears and is trying to get away from this guy. Every time she begins to move away from him he follows her, he physically puts himself in her path so she can't get away. She is so obviously distressed and humiliated, there is no way to misinterpret her behavior. Yet no one on this crowded platform steps in. At this point I'm making eye contact with those around me. Im not proud at all about this, but honestly I was hoping that someone else would step in. This guy's behavior was escalating. He was threatening violence against her then would switch to trying to get her to go with him. I felt so conflicted, I knew that if he put hands on her right then, physically there was nothing I could do. This guy had almost a foot on me and was very physically fit. I'm a tiny ballerina with a baby face, my intimidation factor=0. I had no idea how he would react to someone stepping in. But I have been in that girl's situation before. I felt so guilty watching and so angry at all the passengers. At that point I realized that I had to do something. Anything. The boyfriend walked away a little so I ended up getting close to the girl and asking if she was okay. She didn't really respond and just shook her head. I didn't really have a game plan from there. I just started talking, saying that he has no right to yell at her regardless of what happened literally anything that came to mind and could have been seen as comforting. This calmed down the situation until the boyfriend came back for round 2. Now not only is he screaming at the girlfriend but me as well. We are still standing on a crowded subway platform in the middle of rush hour, tons of people are going by. Only this time a larger man approached asked if everything was alright. In the midst of this two trains emptied onto the platform. It got really crowded fast. In the chaos I lost sight of the couple. I'm not sure what happened to them. I don't believe the man that confronted the angry boyfriend saw the initial conflict. After taking to him he assumed that I was the victim in the situation and the girlfriend was just a bystander. He didn't get why I was trying to shake him off and find the poor girl. At that point I ended up getting on the next train. I don't understand why no one decided to intervene.  I know the bystander effect exists, and know that probably played into the apathy of those around me. I get it, but I'm still so so angry. I can't help but wonder if I could have done more. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Did I do the right thing? Any advice on how to handle a similar situation better? I hope that more people will be encouraged to intervene when they see someone distressed. Thanks for reading.

I've been on four different pills but I can only remember the names of two. Sprintec, which did nothing for my periods and gave me diarrhea during that time of the month. And Gildess Fe which was amazing and made my period much lighter and last 3 days. Unfortunately it got recalled due to manufacture error and I was put on Junel Fe which made me have a heavy period for the entire month.I talked to my original doctor about Nexplanon and he said that there's a decent chance I might not have periods at all especially since I'm an athlete and work out 5 days a week. I was on it for nine months and today I got it removed. After the second month I bled every single day. I was put on birth control pills to stop the bleeding for a few months, which it did, but then returned once I stopped taking them.I'm very opposed to the IUD and we think that my body doesn't respond well to progestin only birth control methods so it is not an option for me. I ended up having to change doctors due to their office constantly screwing up my appointments and insurance.  I tried to talk to a different doctor about taking a continuous pill and I was shut down.

I asked her about Lo loestrin Fe and Amethyst which can stop your period all together and she would not prescribe them to me.

NOTE: the public restroom is in the same room as the employee break room.Lucy was still crying and said \"I don't know why He (supervisor, let's call him Lloyd) acts like this towards me. It only makes things harder on us.\"She said that Lloyd always talks down to female employees and that she couldn't take it much longer. Lucy said that another coworker, Samuel, met with HR yesterday to discuss how Lloyd has been continuing to bully and harass female employees. Samuel says Lloyd never harasses male employees.At this point, Lloyd comes over to the break room and says \"You need to leave,\" and points me away from the break room door. I step back, the door closes, and I turn to the male coworker, Samuel, and tell him \"you should probably go in there so she is not alone. I can't go in there because I don't work here.\" Samuel was obviously intimidated and did not go in.I return to the counter to request my service. It is about 10 feet from the break room. I then hear Lloyd screaming from behind the closed door and I could make out every word he was saying. He was saying something along the lines of \"Why are you back here?\" \"OH, THAT is what you consider rude? I'll show you rude!\" The store was still busy. At this point I turn to Samuel and ask \"are you going to go in there?\" He doesn't reply. So I go to the break room, open the door and see her backed into \"U\" shaped corner (table and desk on either side of her, lockers behind her, she had her pressed against the lockers) , he was 3-4 feet away from her, looming over her, finger pointed in her face, body tense and aggressive, and he was blocking the exit. She was still crying and visibly afraid.I said, very calmly \"you need to lower your voice and get a manager in here for this discussion or you need to come out and have it where you have witnesses\" At this point, Lloyd flips out and starts advancing on me, pointing to me violently \"You need to leave. You need to leave now, you need to GET OUT.\" I said while I was retreating, \"I want to speak to a manager.\"He said \"I AM the manager of this department.\" Still advancing on me, me still retreating down an isle. He was literally lumbering and red in the face. I was terrified at this point.I turn and walk briskly to the front of the store near the store exit and say loudly I wanted to see the manager. The worker retrieved the manager, all the while Lloyd advancing on me saying, \"You need to leave, I will call the cops, you do NOT want this on your record. I WILL call the cops if you don't leave.\". I was alarmed and about to walk out the door but the manager approaches me at this point and asked what was going on.Samuel starts recording the encounter.I told the female manager exactly what I've posted here and that Lloyd should not talk to anyone that way, that Lucy was visibly scared and he was threatening her and now me. I never raised my voice. All the while he was yelling \"This is not your place. I did not raise my voice to Lucy. You're only saying that because she is your friend. Who are you to come in here and tell me what to do?\" I told him I would step in for anyone in this situation, even a stranger. Even if it were a male employee. I wasn't going to stand by and let someone be berated and physically intimidated while backed into a corner.He said, \"I can speak to my employees however I want.\" (On video).What should I do? The manager said she was \"Taking care of it,\" when I called after leaving the store. Should I contact corporate HR? Who do I need to talk to to document this? I don't want Lucy or Samuel to lose their jobs. and I don't want anyone (especially young women) to have withstand his hostility. What do I need to do to protect *MYSELF* after his threats of getting the police involved when he was the one accosted me??I was shocked.Edit: clarity.(1) I did NOT go in to the break room. I opened the door to the break room. Regardless, the break room is also where the public restroom is.(2) I complained to the manager and she said she was \"taking care of it.\" Should I contact corporate? (3) there absolutely is a law against supervisor physical intimidation. It is especially bad because Lloyd has a history of harassing women (which Samuel filed a complaint for). [\"Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.\"](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm)(4) Lloyd said I had to leave, but Lloyd's manager reiterated that I could stay. Legaladvice said I was trespassing per Lloyd's order, but I thought the store manager has final authority on all of those things, so...Edit: clarity.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "73az3i", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "(USA) I (customer, female) witnessed workplace harassment when a superior (male) physically threatened and intimidated an employee (female.)", "num_comments": 3, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 4, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/73az3i/usa_i_customer_female_witnessed_workplace/", "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 01:42:53 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "I would definitely report this to corporate at the highest level.

I can't wait to be married to the love of my life, my best friend. But almost immediately after the news, the wedding anxiety began to set in.Let me start by saying that I don't really care for weddings. I never have. It's just a personal thing, there's certainly nothing wrong with them, but they've just never been *my* thing. Never dreamed about a wedding as a little girl, never cared about wearing a pretty white dress. I was so adamant about my disinterest that for a while I was completely against getting married at all. Eventually (and after meeting my current partner) I came to the realization that I did want to be married. I just wasn't into weddings.Well, now I'm faced with planning one.To be clear, I'm going to have a lot of help. My mother, sister, mother-in-law to be and my fiance have all expressed great interest in planning it out. It's even been offered that I can just hand them the reins and let them come to me for opinions when a decision needs to be made. Honestly, I am very lucky to have such great support. Because I have such a huge amount of anxiety (and because a lot of focus is on the bride) I do think I'm going to stay involved enough to maintain some control over how it all goes down, but still, that helps a lot.However, there's the matter of the guest list.No family is perfect and mine is no exception. There's been drama in my extended family through the years and just recently I witnessed how that can effect a wedding when my cousin got married over the summer. Two of my uncles are divorced, and one of them likely would not have attended if his ex was invited...except it was their daughter getting married, so he kinda had to. My other divorced uncle, my bachelor uncle and my grandmother all threatened not to attend when the other ex-wife received an invitation. It was a horrible position to put my cousin in. Yes, her uncle was the blood relation, but she had known the ex-wife, her aunt, for just as long. I understood why she wanted to invite both of them. And if she had opted not to, that might have offended their three children (our cousins) into not attending either, because their mother wasn't welcome.So now it's my turn to try and wade through the drama. If I invite my aunts, I lose a number of relatives who will refuse to attend. If choose not to invite my aunts, I fear offending their children, and my aunts, to the point of broken relationships, because it would seem like such a slap in the face.What should I do?

Dot points as follows.* She feels powerless in this situation as he is a respected business owner in the area and has the power to harm her business through word of mouth (they share most of their customers on a daily basis)* He has been there forever, and she has only been there for 4 months* Seeking financial reimbursement for customers lost doesn't help her because her business is primarily about visa related matters we wont go into. If they lose customers because of him, there is almost nothing they can do to recover from that situation in any meaningful way.* Her level of involvement in the business will decrease next year as her parents English improves and she returns to study.* He has a fairly low respect for women judging by a number of comments she has relayed to me.* She is fairly introverted and has not worked much customer service before, which adds additional challengesFor these reasons, a confrontational approach might not be practical. But neither of us have much knowledge or experience to inform us further on what she can do to be able to feel comfortable and safe in an environment she can't avoid.Whether it is big advice for the whole situation or little tips to dissuade unwarranted attention while working customer service, even just sharing common experiences, we would appreciate it.Kind regards,Us.Edit: Minor changes", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "7363pq", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Girlfriend being harassed at her small business - advice appreciated", "num_comments": 3, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 2, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7363pq/girlfriend_being_harassed_at_her_small_business/", "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 10:32:37 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "She should nip it in the bud.

So the author isn't a genius for writing down the obvious, and indeed one might even argue that he's not very creative.However, I do think the fact so much of what is in Foundations of Geopolitics has come to pass, shows just how *obvious* its ideas are to the Russian leadership. That is to say, rather than see the author as a sort of master mind who has the ears of the Russian government, we should instead treat him as just stating the common sense strategic analysis that the Russian government already knows about, and has known about for a long time. Where he and the Russian leadership differ is that, not being in charge, he can only sketch what is *obvious* about a strategy, while being ignorant of the more critical details.For example, anyone on Reddit who is at all attentive to geopolitics, can come up with the idea that the US should pressure China over North Korea, because this strategy is obvious. But no one on Reddit would know exactly how to do this, because they lack the political insight into China's leadership and the details of the US Chinese relationship. Just the same, Foundations of Geopolitics can state the obvious that it would be useful to destabilize the US through encouraging racial and ethnic conflict, but how to do it, when to do it, and how best to take advantage of it, these are the most important questions, and it's what distinguishes effective strategy from political theory.To this end, I don't think the Russian leadership is following anyone's script. Rather, they are taking common sense ideas and modifying them to suit what is practical and useful given their present circumstances. Thus, for instance, we don't see Russia trying to destabilize China even though the Foundations of Geopolitics calls for it, likely because, even though the book is right about China being a fundamental threat, Russia simply cannot afford to threaten both China and the US, and so has decided that the US is the larger threat and that it's better to work with an authoritarian and former Communist country, than to work with the old enemy of the Cold War. Putin's personal beliefs likely also play a role in this decision, as he is known to have blamed the US for destroying the Soviet Union.With all that said, I believe the Foundations of Geopolitics is still an useful book as a window into the more popular and common sense ideas within Russian geopolitical strategy.

(I'm a bot)*****> More than two years after Volkswagen AG was thrown into chaos by the diesel-emissions scandal, the German auto giant is still choking.> The latest reminder that the crisis is far from over came Friday when Volkswagen announced it will take a charge of 2.5 billion euros because plans to buy back or retrofit tainted U.S. diesel cars proved more complex than expected.> The continuing fallout compounds pressures facing Volkswagen as it grapples with a disruptive shift in automotive technology, including the prospect of new, nimble competitors like vacuum cleaner pioneer Dyson Ltd. Keeping ahead of the shift to an era of self-driving electric cars requires significant resources, and Volkswagen is planning to invest about 20 billion euros by 2030 to develop a fleet of electric cars and another 50 billion euros to buy the batteries needed to power the vehicles.*****[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/7386lx/vw_still_choking_on_diesel_as_damages_surge_to_30/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~218899 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Volkswagen**^#1 **car**^#2 **diesel**^#3 **More**^#4 **billion**^#5", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 697300, "stickied": false, "score": 11, "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 18:35:34 2017", "ups": 11}, {"body": "What about the other cheaters?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 58641, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 02:34:30 2017", "ups": 5}, {"body": "*Shane* Diesel?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7059, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 01:06:52 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "Diesel still cheaper then Petrol!", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 8496, "stickied": false, "score": -2, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 00:04:08 2017", "ups": -2}, {"body": "There's that German engineering at work.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 3131, "stickied": false, "score": -6, "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 21:58:09 2017", "ups": -6}], "subreddit": "worldnews", "selftext": "", "libertarian": 0.2239842266, "id": "7381rs", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "VW Still Choking on Diesel as Damages Surge to $30 Billion", "num_comments": 89, "conservative": 0.19487816100000002, "pinned": false, "score": 483, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 11268, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/7381rs/vw_still_choking_on_diesel_as_damages_surge_to_30/", "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 18:13:42 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Fuck the scumbags.

A jail is a temporary place of holding before your court date or for sentences carried out under 1 year. Trust me; this guy's sentence is *not* going to be under 1 year.- You may or may not be granted bail. You will only not be granted bail if there is reasonable suspicion that you will not honor your court date.- You go to your court date and get formally tried for vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. - Your judgment determines how many years you spend in *prison*. There are two kinds of DUI manslaughter charges : gross negligence, or without. The former carries a minimum sentence of 4 years per charge, typically with a max of 10 years per charge. The latter carries a minimum sentence of 16 months per charge, max 4 years. Due to the circumstances (he's a police officer *and* killed three people, including a minor, by rear ending them), there is a very high chance that he will face three charges of grossly negligent vehicular manslaughter while under the influence.So the guy walking out of jail doesn't mean that he got a slap on the wrist. He *will* go to prison after his sentencing. I guarantee it.Edit : Added information.Edit 2 : I understand that he didn't post bail. Don't worry guys. This guy has to get arrested. There is no way that the LAPD could afford not to press charges. He will do his time. And if not, then this can even escalate all the way up to the Supreme Court by any one of the many enraged citizens or politicians (a politician who can gain lots of citizens' support as an incentive) who knows about this, which will also likely accompany corruption charges against the higher chain of command.
