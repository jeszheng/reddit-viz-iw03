If you want a full time worker then hire one, not the high school kid who asked for part-time during the entire interview process.Graduated high school soon after and got a job as a basic to high level math tutor at my community college, got paid less but it was so much more enjoyable as a working experience.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2950, "stickied": false, "score": 363, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 20:35:35 2017", "ups": 363}, {"body": "Drinking on the job.

What if instead of society as a whole benefiting from the advances in technology, only a few elites do?  What if the technological boom enslaves the bulk of humanity to the few who control the machines instead of improving life for everyone?  We already see the debate happening with self driving cars.  They could be a boon to society by reducing accidents and improving efficiency.  On the other hand, they will also put many people out of work, and if they cannot find another job, they are worse off without some compensating policy.  The singularity will expand this problem to most, if not all professions.  We will have to fundamentally change our economic paradigm for these types of advances to be a blessing instead of a curse.

Its also worth mentioning that the opiod epidemic has started to become a problem in our area, and people have been getting nastier lately. I've responded to some crazy situations (such as a high 20 something yr old woman screaming and rolling around in her own shit in Mcdicks) but nothing will top this call.  I was responding to a call about 20mins away from town that was supposedly a break-in, but the person on the phone wasnt making much sense and probably was mentally ill/high/etc and was warned to be cautious when entering the home.  I pull up to this house that is just off one of the main highways that run through our county and it is really run down. Roof is sagging, all the lights are out, moss and vines growing everywhere, you get the picture. Some kind of halloween crackhouse. No car in the driveway, which is odd because you need a car to get anywhere since it took 20mins to get to town.  I knock on the door and announce who i am and why i was there. No response. I twisted the door handle and sure enough, it was unlocked. With a hand on my gun and my flashlight out, I entered the house. It smelled awful. I can only describe the smell as burning garbage and cat piss. Its pitch black, theres dirt, bits of food wrappers, and empty pop cans all over the floor. The foyer was dirty, but the living room was a fucking distaster. Piles of garbage and god knows what that are at least 4 feet high take up most of what i assumed was a living room at one point. The smell made my eyes water and burn, and i fought not to gag. The foyer was connected to the living room, then there was a hallway on the left, and a staircase on the right. I heard shuffling noises coming from the kitchen, so i headed that way. I called out again, annoucing who i am and why i was there, and a friendly reminder that cops carry guns. I will admit, i was starting to sweat a little.  As i entered the kitchen, there seemed to be no one there, and thankfully, no more piles of rotting garbage. There was a countertop that covered the corner of the wall, and somehow was spotless compared to the rest of the dirt and garbage filled house, but did have a few objects on it. There was a perfectly clean plate, fork, and knife all set up as if someone was about to sit down and eat a meal, and a single piece of paper on the plate.

I've responded to some crazy situations (such as a high 20 something yr old woman screaming and rolling around in her own shit in Mcdicks) but nothing will top this call.  I was responding to a call about 20mins away from town that was supposedly a break-in, but the person on the phone wasnt making much sense and probably was mentally ill/high/etc and was warned to be cautious when entering the home.  I pull up to this house that is just off one of the main highways that run through our county and it is really run down. Roof is sagging, all the lights are out, moss and vines growing everywhere, you get the picture. Some kind of halloween crackhouse. No car in the driveway, which is odd because you need a car to get anywhere since it took 20mins to get to town.  I knock on the door and announce who i am and why i was there. No response. I twisted the door handle and sure enough, it was unlocked. With a hand on my gun and my flashlight out, I entered the house. It smelled awful. I can only describe the smell as burning garbage and cat piss. Its pitch black, theres dirt, bits of food wrappers, and empty pop cans all over the floor. The foyer was dirty, but the living room was a fucking distaster. Piles of garbage and god knows what that are at least 4 feet high take up most of what i assumed was a living room at one point. The smell made my eyes water and burn, and i fought not to gag. The foyer was connected to the living room, then there was a hallway on the left, and a staircase on the right. I heard shuffling noises coming from the kitchen, so i headed that way. I called out again, annoucing who i am and why i was there, and a friendly reminder that cops carry guns. I will admit, i was starting to sweat a little.  As i entered the kitchen, there seemed to be no one there, and thankfully, no more piles of rotting garbage. There was a countertop that covered the corner of the wall, and somehow was spotless compared to the rest of the dirt and garbage filled house, but did have a few objects on it.

This releases a ton of energy, but it's like trying to push the same pole of two magnets together.  You need to overcome the resistance first to get them to \"touch.\"This requires an enormous amount of energy.  The only way to really confine and squeeze the gas tightly enough to do this is via electromagnetic fields.  More specifically, confining it inside a magnetic coil, like a cylinder.  Usually, we then twist the cylinder back on itself to form a torus, and have the gas zoom around in circles inside the coil.But now you get into the problems:1) The amount of energy needed to drive the magnetic field is enormous, and the current will melt any standard conducting cable or metal.  The only thing that won't heat up when that amount of current goes through it is a superconductor.  There are no known room temperature superconductors, only those operating at very cold temperatures.  So you have to keep the entire thing constantly cooled with liquid nitrogen, and it's prone to break a lot.  The Large Hadron Collider has the same issue and has suffered some high profile breakages this way.2)  As the gas starts to collide and fuse, a plasma is formed.  But plasmas are highly conductive.  As the plasma zooms around, it starts to form its own electromagnetic current and fields, which start to mess with the fields you're using to try and contain it.  This is extremely difficult to detect or model and very hard to adjust in the split-second time frames needed to keep it stable.  We're still figuring out the exact shape required to get the plasma's currents to self-contain in a nice stable way with the others.  So far we can only keep the plasma going for about 100 seconds at the very longest recorded.3)  Energy extraction.  We still haven't quite figured this part out yet.  All that energy in the plasma is \"real,\" but how do you get it out?  The only way we really know right now is using the heat to boil water and use the steam to drive turbines.  This is taken as a \"we'll do it easily once we get to that point,\" but we still aren't even to the point of stable long-standing plasmas so nobody's really invested much into it.  The good news is, we have gotten very close to getting more energy out of the reaction than we put in at this point, and next-gen reactors like ITER are expected to trounce this threshold pretty conclusively.  We know it's doable at scale, now.4)  Fusion is much safer than fission, and does not leave lots of crazy exotic radioactive isotopes everywhere.  This is because most of the radioactivity is confined within the plasma and does not ionize the surrounding material.  However, fusion does produce neutron radiation, which by having no charge, can't be contained that way.  These neutrons bombard the vessel walls and slowly break it down over time.  It's currently unknown how exactly we will avoid having to replace the entire reactor semi-frequently due to this, but like the above problem, it's considered a \"cross that bridge when we get to it\" issue that will be solved by some kind of new material.", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 19258, "stickied": false, "score": 11891, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 06:14:26 2017", "ups": 11891}, {"body": "Right now we have a few major issues:1. First Wall Problem: The fusion plasma needs a high product of density-temperature-confinement. Practical solutions almost always involve plasma at millions of degrees C. The plasma will also emit a lot of neutrons, assuming the mainstream D-T fuel approach. The layer of the reactor that faces the plasma is called the first wall, and in most fusion schemes it needs to have some pretty intense properties to survive.2. Simulation: Simulating a plasma is really hard. It has both fluid dynamics and electro-mechanics. This is called Magneto Hydro Dynamics (MHD), and it is a fairly good approximation of certain regimes of plasma operation. It is quite difficult to solve and simulate due to the nasty nature of the underlying equations. Fluid dynamics is very non-linear and chaotic, which is why it is hard to predict weather far into the future. There are many different code bases used to simulate MHD but as far as I know they all have their own major tradeoffs and there is no clear winner.3. Exotic hardware: most fusion schemes require expensive power supplies, since there is almost always a large amount of power involved in the process. The National Ignition Facility is a major fusion project and has 330MJ of capacitors that pulse into flash lamps which fire massive lasers at a tiny pellet of DT fuel. This capacitor bank is billions of dollars, and takes up several football fields.

Part of this waylaid by the fact that plasma research has been extensively gutted, below the point where researchers said \"if we get only this much money, we'll never achieve it.\"ITER, when it's finally done, will at least produce more power than it consumes, but it won't be economical to sell.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 398880, "stickied": false, "score": 148, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 06:11:42 2017", "ups": 148}, {"body": "I didn't understand why fusion is difficult until I read a short article called \"[A Pint of the Sun](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast110_99/sunfire.html)\" by Joshua Barnes.  Here's the article in its entirety:> Descriptions of nuclear `burning' in stars sometimes give the impression that the central furnace of a star is a place of violent activity. In fact, the inside of a star is rather peaceful, and hydrogen burning goes on very slowly.> To appreciate this, imagine we had a magic transporter which could beam one pint of gas from the center of the Sun right into this room. One pint of water weighs one pound, but the center of the Sun has a density about 150 times the density of water, so a pint of sun-stuff weighs almost as much as I do.> Now the first thing that would happen is that this building would vanish in a huge explosion. When it was down these in the center of the Sun, the gas was compressed by the vast weight of all the thick layers of dense material above it, so it was under enormous pressure. When it's suddenly transported to Earth, the confining pressure is removed, and the gas expands -- very rapidly. The explosion would have the force of a small nuclear bomb.> So if we want to get this experiment approved by the University administration, we need to make a container which can hold our pint of sun-stuff under pressure without bursting apart. That's not easy to do, but we've already assumed we have a transporter right out of Star Trek, so a little more magic won't be noticed. But our troubles are not over, because this gas from the center of the sun is incredibly hot, and the heat would escape in the form of X-rays, cooking everyone in the vicinity.> OK, let's assume we can make the walls of our container perfectly reflective, so that all the escaping heat energy is reflected right back in. I said we were using magic, didn't I? So we have a pint of sun-stuff sitting right there in front of us, safe as can be. Now let's allow a little energy to escape -- just exactly the amount of energy being generated by nuclear reactions, so the gas stays at a constant temperature. We can use the escaping energy to run a generator and produce electricity. Thermonuclear power!> But before we call a press conference or make any big deals with HECO, we better figure out how much energy those bottled nuclear reactions are generating. And the answer is...> About a thousand times less energy than I'm generating by breathing. That's all! Per unit mass, the Sun produces much less energy than a living human body. In total, the Sun generates a lot of energy, but that's only because it's so massive. If I was as massive as Jupiter -- perish the thought -- I'd produce more energy than the Sun, just from my body heat.> Of course, the Sun produces energy by nuclear reactions, while I produce energy by chemical reactions. That's how the Sun can go on shining for ten billion years, whereas I get hungry every few hours.> The enormous lifetime of the Sun gives us another perspective on the same basic point, which is that nuclear reactions in stars are, for the most part, very slow and gentle. It takes about ten billion years for all the hydrogen in the center of the Sun to be burned to helium. That means that per year, a hydrogen nucleus has about one chance in ten billion of being involved in a nuclear reaction. The center of the Sun is an incredibly safe place for hydrogen nuclei! A hydrogen nucleus in the Sun runs much less risk of undergoing a nuclear reaction than I do of being hit by lightning.So why is fusion so difficult?  We're trying to do better than nature and it appears that nature, trying its very best at the heart of our star, is doing a rather humdrum job.  In the short term (\"short\" meaning roughly *3 million years* in this context), there is many orders of magnitude more energy just in the pressure of the solar core than there is in the fusion taking place in the sun.  Without that pressure, we get no fusion at all.  And on top of that, we would need to efficiently extract the energy released by fusion.  Unless we are exceptionally clever (and as you'll read from other responses in this thread, we actually are pretty clever), we can't perform the same type of fusion that the sun does without first building up an insurmountable energy deficit.**Edit:** By the way, to quantify these claims, including my \"3 million years\" figure, I pulled some numbers directly from Wikipedia's article on [the solar core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core).  The power density is 276.5 W/m^3, which works out to 0.1308 W/pint.  The pressure, which can also be interpreted as the pressure energy per unit volume, is 265 billion bars (261 billion atmospheres).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 9521, "stickied": false, "score": 149, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 11:45:16 2017", "ups": 149}], "subreddit": "askscience", "selftext": "", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "744w7q", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "What are the main complications stopping us from using nuclear fusion?", "num_comments": 1217, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 14299, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 5398, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/744w7q/what_are_the_main_complications_stopping_us_from/", "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 05:14:36 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "the temperature needed is 6 [times](http://science.howstuffworks.com/fusion-reactor2.htm) hotter than the sun because we cannot achieve the same density (well we are currently not attempting to anyways).the [funding](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/03/23/nuclear-fusion-reactor-research/#.WdRHXVtSypo) has always been less than required. always 30 years [away](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/03/23/nuclear-fusion-reactor-research/)most of the \"efforts\" are really just a camouflage for nuclear weapons testing.  if you come up with a good way for fusion you just made a great bomb.  even if you dont succeed you will likely learn something about improve yields or decreasing weight/input energy.[this](https://phys.org/news/2017-03-path-nuclear-fusion.html) appears to be the best bet to me anyways.  it is basically breaking or atleast bending the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle .   we need some way to promote the particles from fusing in a non natural way, increase the chance of collisions by forcing particles into one another.there is also the \"problem\" that solar power is pretty dam (depending on your latitude) cheap and abundant.

If we put a nuclear power plant everywhere that we're currently using coal, we'd have much better odds of reducing the progression of climate change. \"All the waste from a nuclear power plant during the course of a year, can fit in the space beneath a small desk.\" It is not so for coal, and other non-renewables.

You can always capture all prefactors and accumulate them into one constant.This is the case with all such relations. Newton's law of universal gravity is: Force of gravity = G m1 m2/r^2 where m1 is the mass of the first object, m2 is the mass of the second and r is the distance between them.   G is an experimental constant that makes the units match and the numbers \"scale\".  For example, 2 masses of 1kg at a separation of 1 meter would make m1 m2/r^2 = 1 kg^2 / m^2.  However, kg^2 /m^2 is not even a unit of force (which is a Newton or a kg m / s^2 ) and two 1 kg objects with a separation of 1 meter do not experience 1 Newton of gravitational force, that's what G does, given the units we arbitrarily chose it scales the number to actually be the correct amount for gravity and it also maps the correct units onto each other).The ideal gas law can also be written as PV = N kb T, where N is the number of particles rather than moles, kb is the experimental constant. Coulomb/electrostatic force goes like Force = k q1 q1 / r^2 where q1 and q1 are the charge of the two particles (notice the similarity to the form of Newton's law of universal gravitation).  k is the experimental constant.And so on.>and so were given arbitrary values that caught on?The numerical value of the experimental constant is determined by the units used and will take a different value depending on whether you're working in SI, \"Freedom\"/Imperial Units or Stadia per Fortnight.  However, that is not the same as saying they are arbitrary.  They encode real information about the nature of the systems that produces them.

Take, and these are just made up numbers, ( 1.21 P )( 0.78 V) = (1.1 n)(0.3 T)and you could write that as PV = ( (1.1x0.3)/(0.78 x 1.21) ) nT and just take (1.1x0.3)/(0.78x1.21) ~ 0.35 and give it a name, the \"Cantgetno197 constant\" and then you're set.  You can always capture all prefactors and accumulate them into one constant.This is the case with all such relations. Newton's law of universal gravity is: Force of gravity = G m1 m2/r^2 where m1 is the mass of the first object, m2 is the mass of the second and r is the distance between them.   G is an experimental constant that makes the units match and the numbers \"scale\".  For example, 2 masses of 1kg at a separation of 1 meter would make m1 m2/r^2 = 1 kg^2 / m^2.  However, kg^2 /m^2 is not even a unit of force (which is a Newton or a kg m / s^2 ) and two 1 kg objects with a separation of 1 meter do not experience 1 Newton of gravitational force, that's what G does, given the units we arbitrarily chose it scales the number to actually be the correct amount for gravity and it also maps the correct units onto each other).The ideal gas law can also be written as PV = N kb T, where N is the number of particles rather than moles, kb is the experimental constant. Coulomb/electrostatic force goes like Force = k q1 q1 / r^2 where q1 and q1 are the charge of the two particles (notice the similarity to the form of Newton's law of universal gravitation).  k is the experimental constant.And so on.>and so were given arbitrary values that caught on?The numerical value of the experimental constant is determined by the units used and will take a different value depending on whether you're working in SI, \"Freedom\"/Imperial Units or Stadia per Fortnight.  However, that is not the same as saying they are arbitrary.  They encode real information about the nature of the systems that produces them.  For example in our gravity law, G tells the magnitude of force that two masses at a distance experience gravitationally.

But even if you accept this, you're still wasting people's votes essentially to even the score. You're not pretending it's OK. I've never seen Republicans defend gerrymandering honestly as a good thing. Generally, they'll just deny that it's a serious problem (typically trying to change the subject to geographical sorting) and then trot out the tried and true \"what about?\" Everybody knows it's wrong. A few Republicans, like McCain and Schwarzenegger, are willing to acknowledge this publicly. [Others, like Reihan Salam, go further](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/opinion/how-to-make-congress-bipartisan.html) recognizing that although gerrymandering is a problem, eliminating it won't entirely fix the vote wastage.

Well, since I'm getting the same replies over and over again, allow me to summarize my responses here.I highly doubt this special team is secretly sitting on some major, substantial evidence, and I doubt they're going to find anything that the FBI, CIA, and NSA couldn't find in a year.These investigations have all leaked evidence left and right, and practically every time this \"special\" investigation changed its scope, that information had been leaked to the press beforehand. Whoever has access to this inside information is more than likely going to leak the most damning information they know about. They're not going to just ignore some major bombshell this team is sitting on while choosing to leak these other major decisions. But hey, maybe Mueller has managed to keep all the good stuff secret while doing a piss-poor job protecting all this. But I really doubt it. The FBI had no substantial evidence for this back when Comey was involved, and we know that because surely they would have been investigating Trump directly if they did, and Comey admitted they weren't. This was after they had been investigating the campaign's potential ties to Russia for over a year.On top of that, you really have to consider how unlikely it is that Trump's campaign could pull something like this off. Our intelligence agencies heavily monitor Russia. As we know from the Vault 7 and Snowden leaks, these agencies have the ability to hack into cell phones, TV sets, and read any email they want. I doubt Trump could communicate digitally with Russia under the NSA's nose, and I highly doubt our intelligence wasn't looking closely into that possibility. This collusion theory has been peddled since long before Trump won, and these agencies aren't going to just ignore the threat of a potential Russian puppet running the White House.And if your idea is that this collusion was done solely through \"secret meetings,\" well that doesn't exactly mesh with reality either. Two of the alleged conspirators of this collusion are Michael Flynn, a three star Lieutenant General who served in the army for 30 years, and Jeff Sessions, who has been serving in some form of political office since 1975. I don't think these two people who have both been serving their country for 30+ years would turn around and commit treason. But let's say they did. Even despite the moral conflict of knowing that a foreign adversary has influence over our President, I don't think they, along with everyone involved in this conspiracy, and anyone else who is simply aware of it, would be keeping their mouths shut about it under the pressure of non-stop 24/7 breaking news headlines like this. History has shown us that secrets like this can't be kept. Practically the moment they began holding hearings about Nixon's involvement in the Watergate cover-ups, multiple staffers spilled the beans to the Watergate committee. Clinton couldn't even cover up a blowjob, and that conspiracy involved only two people. I would just assume that even if all this collusion took place off the record, in secret meetings somewhere, that someone involved would have confessed something by now. No one has.And to anyone who says \"we already have evidence of collusion:\" we don't. We have a bunch of loose, circumstantial evidence and third degree ties that have been dug up by the media, but we don't have direct evidence. In other words, we have no evidence that directly supports this accusation without some major presumption. Keep in mind that the media has been, for about a year, clearly accusing Trump of collusion to undermine the election process. Trying to get oppo-research on Clinton and colluding to undermine the election are two very different things, so acting like this meeting suddenly \"proves\" the whole collusion theory is just disingenuous. It's just moving the goalpost as it's far more benign than the original accusation. You can't spend a year accusing someone of being a serial arsonist and then act like you're right because you've found a few matches in his kitchen.Likewise, Manafort working for the Ukraine in 2014 isn't direct evidence that the campaign colluded with Russia to undermine the election. Sessions meeting with a Russian ambassador isn't direct evidence either. This is circumstantial evidence, and it's only in the public eye because our sensationalist media is turning over every stone looking for any third degree link they can find between Trump and Russia. Nancy Pelosi met with the same Russian ambassador Sessions did, and she failed to recall that meeting too. We don't call that \"direct evidence of collusion to undermine the election,\" because obviously there's a reasonable explanation for it. There's a difference between circumstantial evidence and direct evidence.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 6585, "stickied": false, "score": -51, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 18:23:20 2017", "ups": -51}, {"body": "Why is this subreddit even called politics?

But what it did is create doubt in the election process.  The fact these ads were played in those states and the Russians were \"caught\" (I'm sure they wanted that to happen) means that half of Reddit will now believe Trump only won because of the Russians. They will see their president as illegitimate.  But understand this is what the Russians wanted the whole time.  It didn't matter who won.  If Hillary won exactly the same thing would have played out.

But not federal statutory law.Here's what it does require:18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2331 defines domestic terrorism as:>(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;and>(B) appear to be intended\u2014>(i) **to intimidate or coerce a civilian population**;>(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; **or**>(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnappingNotice the \"or\" (which I've helpfully bolded in case it wasn't obvious).I get not everyone is a lawyer or went to law school or has ever read a statute, but that \"or\" is important.  Because it says that if it meets *any* part of section (B) that is sufficient by itself.

To \"frighten or overawe someone **especially** [NB: does not mean exclusively] in order to make them do what one wants.\"  Or if we want to class it up with some online legal dictionaries: \"to intentionally say or do something which would cause a person of ordinary sensibilities to be fearful of bodily harm.\"So let's take it from the top:Did he engage in \"acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State\"?  100%.Does that \"appear to be intended to intimidate [\"cause a person of ordinary sensibilities to be fearful of bodily harm\"]\"?

More helpful: Credit freeze because this restricts individuals with your information from opening up lines of credit without your consent.

Currently companies must send breach notifications to consumers within a specific time frame (varies by state), but notifications alone are generally unhelpful because notice occurs after the breach and when the harm is already done. What may be a better system is creating ways for companies to be held liable by consumers with penalties (e.g, like the 2% of GDR in EU) or categorizing breaches like hurricanes on a scale of 1-5 for consumers. A 1 may be a a breach of easily accessible information (address and name) requiring a small fine; whereas a 5 may require a large fine, internal audit by a third party, a mass breach alert, and a large fine. These modifications would create incentives for companies to be more careful with personal information. Least helpful: Credit monitoring because it only alerts you when a fraudulent action on your account has occurred. The damage is already done. More helpful: Credit freeze because this restricts individuals with your information from opening up lines of credit without your consent. However, not as helpful after thr Equifax breach because they recieved social securitt information, birth dates, and license plate numbers and can do much more. It is not totally helpful for fraud unrelated to your credit such as filing income taxes in your name, filling out fraudulent checks, using your medical benefits, etc. Credit freezes are most helpful for older people who have established their credit, but for us youngsters who need to grow our credit a credit freeze can be difficult.

A backlash of the anti College rape policies during the Obama Administration which made it very easy for a rape accuser to get someone expelled. 2. A rape accusation can be made with little to no physical evidence. It just takes someone willing to call the police. This makes it a unique crime in that there doesn't objectively have to be any  physical damage or loss. 3. The penalty for making a false rape accusation is very small compared to the consequences for falsely being accused of rape.  it is a lot harder to convict someone who was proven to have made a false accusation than it is for a rapist to be convicted. They basically have to admit they lied. 4. Many guys have anecdotal experiences with women threatening them with false accusations or know someone who has experienced it.5. Men are treated differently than women with regards to rape. Men are synonymous with rapists for all practical purposes. Society hasn't really even considered the reality that women can be rapists too. That's basically the arguments I've seen or can remember. A lot more women have been raped than men who have been falsely accused. But in this patriarchal society there is a real fear for men being falsely accused because society tells them they have to initiate relationships and everything up to and including sex.

Everytime I say men I mean men who obsess over the false accusations thing and use it against feminism. I feel this is a relatively new phenomena... not women falsely accusing men of rape but males claiming oppression because of it. I find this to be an incredible non-issue, and an inadvertent attempt to regress the feminist movement. The further we go, unapologetically taking away a man's right to violate a woman in any way, shape or form, they seem to be increasingly uncomfortable with it. For example, people are falsely accused of murder. We don't take this up with attempted murder victims, or advocate against laws that prevent murder. Every time a woman falsely accuses a man of rape, it becomes a huge deal and is cited as reasons females have privilege over men. One might argue that it is a privilege because men can not exploit the system to ruin a woman's life simply by accusing her of rape, which admittedly, would most likely not be taken as seriously or cause the same backlash. However, this in itself is a symptom of toxic masculinity, advocated by the patriarchy-not feminism. And while this fact may be true, it illustrates a deeper contention these men harbor.The reason I feel this way is because **I don't feel it is logical or natural to feel the need to obsess over being falsely accused of something, so far as to spend excessive amount of time speaking/arguing etc about it** I believe the only reason this is even a thing is because it is a male vs. female issue. I believe there is something there subconsciously that resents the power women are beginning to demand and the notion that they may have to one day see us as equals. I believe this something irks these men, in a way they can not identify, they know they don't like the idea that rape is now defined in more clear terms, and that bullying a woman sexually is getting a little more difficult to get away with. When I say rape I don't mean breaking into a room in the middle of the night with a ski mask with a knife to the throat- These men are clearly against this and see this as abhorrent. I mean rape as in a close friend taking advantage of the fact that a woman is intoxicated and pushing himself on her even though she is clearly resistant. There is no more room for leeway or speculation. If she did not consent, it is rape. I can only imagine how much this shift must have helped women, men will now think twice before pulling something like that. He is no longer safe in the knowledge that she will be slut-shamed, that she will be scared to speak out. I'm not saying these things don't still happen, but I do believe the trend of trivializing rape and magnifying a woman's sexual conquests is starting to shift. We are on the path to leveling it out currently, a woman's sexual freedom is being encouraged, and rape in ways previously perceived as harmless are being called out for they are.   I just want to ponder on that right there for a moment. **Why is it so ridiculous and oppressive to require a simple acknowledgement of consent before sex?** No one is asking people to sign a contract before having sex, but even if that was required I still don't feel the backlash we are receiving is justified. If it can protect the safety of your fellow humans why is it seen as a huge oppression/inconvenience/atrocity rather than a part of life? No one complains about being ID'd before being served alcohol or entering a nightclub. Yes, it's unfortunate that some people can not drink responsibly at a certain age, and yes it's unfortunate that some people lie about their age and put the business at risk, yes it's slightly inconvenient that you need to carry your ID on you and pull it out and explicitly show the doorman even though you're innocent and are not partaking in either of those two things. But we do it without complaint or thought don't we? We do it out of habit because we understand that there are laws in place for everyone's protection.... we don't go on and on about the absurdity of having to show an ID. Why then is it SO ridiculous to confirm consent before sex? I mean, we are all capable of reading the room, if you find yourself in a situation where you are unsure of consent.... then just ask? Obviously, no one is even saying consent should be explicitly asked for each time before sex as a law or anything, nor am I (back to the being able to read the room thing) but just for the sake of argument even if it was, why is that SUCH a travesty if it may protect a good amount of the population? The only reason I bring that up is what is actually required, is even more trivial than signing a contract or being legally required to ask an exact question... just be respectful and sensitive towards your sexual partner. If this is followed, unless the 'victim' is genuinely trying to be malicious there is essentially no risk of being caught in a situation where there is a misunderstanding of rape. Now as for the case of the person who does falsely accuse out of nowhere just for the sake of being malicious. I just don't understand why this is a thing in specific which gets attention-especially since it's used to prevent laws that protect true victims in the first place! Basically **your fear of being falsely accused of something which you have an incredibly low chance of being falsely accused in is given more thought and deems to be a cause worth fighting against at the expense of the actual victims of that crime?!** I'm sorry but to me this is just ridiculous. If you do your research you will find the number of people that are falsely accused is incredibly low. There will always be people who are able to make false accusations *for any crime*. Making a false accusation of any sort is relatively easy, getting the person *convicted* on the other hand is a lot more difficult, but this holds true with *any* crime. People falsely accuse others of murders but *why do I not know the names of these people doing the accusations?* Why is there no movement against organizations that condemn countries that are committing genocide because it is so easy to accuse a country of committing genocide? Because that is a ridiculous issue to spend time fighting over. **Why is it in the news every time someone's reputation is ruined because they are falsely accused of rape but not in the news every time a someone is murdered because they were accused of committing a petty theft?**While these are both issues my last thought I will leave you with is the inherent sexism I see in the way we tackle said issues. Never have I seen such an obsession with the idea of being falsely accused of a crime, at expense at the victims of the crime itself. When someone is falsely accused of a different crime such as theft or murder, we do not fixate on his accuser and fixate on how we can make it so that in the future his accuser will have less credibility or have a harder time prosecuting. We do not blame people who advocate against theft or murder or try to hinder their cause. We do not use it against them to make it more difficult to report or prosecute such crimes. We instead worry about why the due process to determine the accused's innocence did not take place. We worry about why the system failed said person, *We don't direct that towards the group of victims most susceptible to the crime in retaliation*. I guess in the end my question then is why is it that rape is seen so differently than every other crime, why is it that it's a feminists job to defend or advocate jobs preventing rape, or to justify false rape accusations?

And it's not even difficult. \"Do you like that? Does that feel good? Want me to keep going?\" These are all things I have said during sex, or have been said to me. It didn't stop our progress, it didn't alter the mood. It was said all \"sexy\", not like the robot voice when I call Verizon that says, \"You wanted ....customer....service....Is that correct?\" If you don't know how to talk to your partner during sex...even just to confirm they're having a good time...maybe sex isn't right for you.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5726, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Thu Oct  5 03:15:19 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Do you have any links that aren't some kind of echo-chamber that might let me read some of these opinions?

A backlash of the anti College rape policies during the Obama Administration which made it very easy for a rape accuser to get someone expelled. 2. A rape accusation can be made with little to no physical evidence. It just takes someone willing to call the police. This makes it a unique crime in that there doesn't objectively have to be any  physical damage or loss. 3. The penalty for making a false rape accusation is very small compared to the consequences for falsely being accused of rape.  it is a lot harder to convict someone who was proven to have made a false accusation than it is for a rapist to be convicted. They basically have to admit they lied. 4. Many guys have anecdotal experiences with women threatening them with false accusations or know someone who has experienced it.5. Men are treated differently than women with regards to rape. Men are synonymous with rapists for all practical purposes. Society hasn't really even considered the reality that women can be rapists too. That's basically the arguments I've seen or can remember. A lot more women have been raped than men who have been falsely accused. But in this patriarchal society there is a real fear for men being falsely accused because society tells them they have to initiate relationships and everything up to and including sex. There is a genuine fear that something could go horribly wrong along the way.

This will probably be a long story. My first experience with sex was coercive rape by my boyfriend at the time. I wasn\u2019t ready to have sex at all and denied him many times. He held me down and once I started bleeding pulled out and sent me home. I was 16. I remember going home and crying, feeling violated but also confused cause he was my boyfriend and he was supposed to love me. He continued to force me to have sex with him. I remember once we had sex on the floor and he covered my mouth with his hand cause his dad was home and he didn\u2019t want to get caught. I never considered this rape or abuse, I think mostly because he was my boyfriend. I knew that it felt so wrong and it affected me emotionally and psychologically, but after he continued to force me to have sex with him I started to think it was normal, that sex was just for men and I wasn\u2019t meant to enjoy it. I literally thought it was normal to just tolerate being treated that way. Fast forward a couple years - a guy I met at a music festival got me drunk and then told me I could stay the night with him. I had a boyfriend at the time but accepted the offer cause I was too drunk to drive home. I made it clear that I had a boyfriend and wasn\u2019t going to do anything sexual with him and he said okay. I fell asleep and woke up in the morning to him inside me. I remember just laying there trying not to cry. I got up and left afterwards, I went home and cried and contemplated if I should tell my boyfriend or not. I felt so guilty and fucked up about it, but again never really allowed myself to think that I was raped. I blamed myself, I was stupid for letting him get me drunk, for going home with him, for falling asleep in his bed  For just laying there and not doing anything about it. I truly believed it was my fault so I never thought too deeply about it. Looking back now, I think both of these experiences, especially the first one, gave me such a fucked up idea of what sex should be. I have only enjoyed having sex once or twice in my life. I started having sex with whoever paid attention to me and would let them do whatever they wanted to me. Guys always wanted to have really rough sex and I let them, I never thought about how I didn\u2019t like it, I thought it was normal to just take it if that\u2019s what they wanted. This weekend I was with a guy I\u2019ve slept with before and he was being really rough. It got to the point where him being inside me hurt, and he was biting me and trying to choke me hard and holding me down. I asked him to stop and he didn\u2019t and I laid there and thought to myself \u201coh my god, this feels like being raped. oh my god, I\u2019ve been raped before\u201d and even though I\u2019ve always known in the back of my head that I was raped, I guess this was the moment I really came to terms with it and realized how much it\u2019s really fucked me up. I ended up squirming away from him and he kind of apologized. I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it, and how much I have tolerated being treated like shit over the years. It feels and sounds so dumb for me to say that I never came to terms with being raped and how much sexual abuse I just let happen to me FOR SO LONG. I want to know that I\u2019m not alone and I\u2019m not dumb for never identifying it and grieving, and now that I have it feels so heavy. I can\u2019t get it out of my head, ive been at work trying not to cry today and I feel so confused that I\u2019m only just now feeling all of this after so long.

I came out to my parents when I was 23 and I'm 26 now. My mom is a devout Buddhist and she gets extremely angry when I bring up homosexuality. (But shouldn't they be practicing loving everybody...?) Traditionally, Koreans aren't super accepting of gay culture. My parents shun the idea of homosexuality and view it as something taboo and sin. Till this day, they're living in denial and believe that their, \"beautiful Korean daughter will marry a rich and handsome Korean man and is not a taco muncher.\"Because my parents are not supportive of my sexuality, it caused a strain on my relationship with them. Sucks, but that's life for me.I've learned that just because your parents gave birth to you, you're not obligated to appease them at all times. You have your own future to worry about and your happiness is extremely important too. It's not being selfish. Why would you want to live your life constantly pleasing somebody who won't accept or at least tolerate your identity? I keep my conversations and contact with my mom to a minimum and I don't tell her anything about myself anymore.It sucks but if she won't at least tolerate my orientation, I don't want to give her the time of day. I know I sound like a fucked up daughter and is probably going to get heated for this, but to me it feels very toxic and unfair that I'm unable to be myself and open up to the women who I want to be close with just because of my orientation.But yes, communication is important. Like what the other Redditors have said, telling him is the first step and it'll be hard, but you can get through it. All it takes is a second of courage to get the first step out of the way.

Apparently Self-Insurance is on the rise in the US, and it basically means that your employer foots the bill for your medical expenses, rather than footing the bill for your insurance. The nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) found that about 6 in 10 private-sector workers were covered by self-insured plans in 2011, up from about 4 in 10 in the late 1990s. I've been looking around for anyone raising a ruckus about this and can't which blows my mind. Even without personally identifying information, any manager could easily leverage this data to find out things in medium sized companies like who got an abortion, who's being treated for depression, etc etc etc. [edit: added this for clarity] But this isn't about the software, thats just how I became aware of this. The software actually makes attempts to obscure personally identifying data. But if a company is self-insured, they have access to this data. They might not exercise it, but they can, and that's the issue. I'm horrified that my employer has this information.

Title is the TL; DR. here's the full story:I was headed to the gym before work after having been off since last thursday for an extended birthday weekend. So this guy gets on the train yelling nonsense, annoying everyone cause it's 6:20am and he's being super loud. Two women get on, very pretty, maybe late 20's/early 30's. He comes over and tells one she has beautiful feet. (so gross.) He continues to try to talk to her (15 mins) and she's clearly ignoring him and talking to her friend. Then he starts asking her what time it is over and over and over, like a child, for like a full 2 minutes.Finally, I can't take it anymore, from 3 seats away I say \"it's 6:45, leave her the fuck alone!\"He says he wasn't talking to me. I say \"it doesn't matter, she's not talking to YOU and you're obviously not getting the hint.\" He goes on about how this is none of my business, he knows her husband (? to which I said \"so you're hitting on your friend's wife? yeah ok.\") etc etc and I just keep telling him she doesn't want to talk to him, it's fucking too early for this shit, go away.He turns his full focus on me and starts talking about how ugly I am. \"your hair, your features, your teeth\" it's all ugly. He would never fuck me. To which I say good, don't worry, I'd never fuck you. The two ladies got up and moved to the other end of the car and he continues to yell at me, he says \"i wish I could stick my dick in your face\" and continues to say how ugly I am while also mentioning that he has a condom and would rape me. I kept a brave face up but I was shaking harder than I ever have and not a single fucking man (or person) in that car said shit to him. I put in my broken headphones and pretended not to hear him anymore, waited a few stops, and when he went to go move to a different seat, I got off the train to wait for the next one.As soon as I got off I broke down crying, called my husband and just sobbed on the phone to him. What happened to loving your fellow man? Why did no one say anything to him when he was harassing that woman for a half hour and then again not say anything when he was threatening me with violence and sexual assault?

I do not have 2 X Chromosomes, although I wish I did; I am a trans-woman, and have been full-time for quite awhile. I recently married the love of my life, and over the course of the first year together, sex was fiery, passionate, and incredible. My spouse got their first big-person job, and works long hours, and is often depressed. I go to shool full-time, and work part-time. Ever since they started working full-time our frequency of sex has diminished to once a week, to less than once a month at this point. I know that they were a victim of rape, and that plays heavily into their disinterest in sex. I don't want to have sex more with them. I just want them to want to have sex with me, and I'd like to get us both their in the healthiest way possible. I've never not immediately stopped when asked, and I've never behaved in a negative in the context of sex. I even get turned off when I can tell that my spouse isn't even the mood, and they are just doing foreplay for me. I have brought up the idea of couples therapy, and it was met with agreement, but for the time being, they are trying to put on a happy face, but i can read through it, just like they can read through mine when they ask if I am happy. I mean, I am happy overall, in general, but I do feel empathy for their situation; if it is the case, that they would want to have sex with me but cannot. I recently tried to voice my concerns as best I could, and it was met level-headedly, but I am not sure what concrete steps to actually take, what type of exercises to do, etc. We both kind of got naked last night, after spending the whole afternoon just hanging out and talking to one another and eating/prepping dinner. I enjoyed making out, and didn't anticipate sex in the slightest, as we agreed to just hang out naked. (Which I think is a good exercise, right? i mean, trying to be as passive, and non-invasive as possible)i have a lot of different thoughts going around: what if they are out of love with me? what if its my male anatomy triggering them? (maybe there was a reason they are a lesbian, and i am an idiot) The thing that hurt the most was when I spoke with them and they said \"i love you; I personally would be happy if we never had sex again\" (meaning that they would find fulfillment in our relationship if were not to ever have sex again) I feel like it was a lie though, not to me, but to themselves. I've gotten a lot of perspective from them, in terms of what it feels like to be dealing with social issues having been a victim of rape, feeling like your very existence is asking for unsolicited gross sexual provocations. I cant say I truly understand the feeling, but I have a good idea. Conversely, on my end, I have social issues, where I feel like everyone is looking at me, also externally or internally expressing feelings of disgust. (or also gross expressions of desire)  (i also worked as a sex-worker for several years, so that probably didn't help me on a psychological level too much) So, what I desire most, what really makes me feel fulfilled, is someone(with whom I share love and affection) expressing genuine lust for me on a physical level; I want someone to want me, not just because I am their fetish, but because we connect on a physical and emotional level, and they find me physically appealing. Not because they think Im sexually frustrated (which is also true, but not the reason of my bummed state of mind), but because they want me. Where do we go from here?

Don Davies, thankfully, isn't buying any of it.First the committee started a week early and jammed 90 witnesses into a single week, and featured some of the best testimony that's probably ever been given in the country's history: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-6X8KpL4U&list=PLNCgT-5hF_ckSWyT7pjS55FT8e-saNmTyThen Davies repeatedly called for more witnesses, which would include young people, edible and concentrate manufacturers, current dispensary operators and regular Canadians. His motion was shot down, so he made clear he'd fight line-by-line through the legislation.Now that he's working his way through the bill, the Liberals and Conservatives have blocked almost every reasonable amendment, voting together against Davies, 8 against 1. The hearings are truly a work of theatre. Liberal MPs are lying about the number of witnesses they called. Conservative MPs are admitting cannabis can't kill you, but still want it regulated like child pornography and inciting terrorism. And both of them are voting in party blocks, ignoring all the submitted testimony and evidence. 8 against 1.They even mock the idea of Canadians watching the proceedings.I highly recommend watching the full day's coverage. Some progress has been made, with calls to allow plants growing higher than 100cm and the inclusion of edibles and concentrates within a year of the bill's passing, but the massive criminalization elements are still in place and will do the most damage to the country: http://parlvu.parl.gc.ca/XRender/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20171003/-1/28007?Currently day three's been canceled.Full hearing info: http://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/HESA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=9603581#briefs-submitted-item", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2315, "stickied": false, "score": 9, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 23:07:26 2017", "ups": 9}, {"body": ">He (Trudeau)  emphasizes that the goal of legalization is not to make money.>He says all first ministers agree that the priority is to keep marijuana out of the hands of kids and out of the control of criminal gangs.I love this guy", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 50541, "stickied": false, "score": 169, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 17:54:47 2017", "ups": 169}, {"body": "Lol at people who say they're still going to buy from dealers.

Regardless of that, judging by the downvotes, I can see that most people are thinking emotionally rather than logically; which is understandable when tragedy hits.

Sounds like a typical school to me. Anytime there was drama at my school, classmates would watch until the teacher puts a stop to it. Plus these kids watching are in middle school and can't be expected to have the maturity of an adult. Punish the bully for sure but this whole situation has been taken WAAAAY too far. Kids will watch because they're curious and don't know better. They definitely do not deserve suspension for simply watching and recording to show peers the latest fight at school. Kid may be a bully but a police investigation is over the top. This attack could have been anything from a shove to a headbutt but the article never says that Perez was forced to seek medical attention. So it's likely the bully was just being the asshole we all had in school.>\"I'm not going let it fade away,\" Perez said. \"I'm going to make sure that people know that trans lives, every life, matters.\"*Sigh* Highly doubt anyone tried to kill her. Someone probably fed her this bullshit line when in reality she just doesn't want to be bullied. Nobody is really helping her. It's just a bunch of virtue signalling people looking for brownie points from the public instead of actually trying to help the kid.
