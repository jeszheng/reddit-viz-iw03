They started by \"working the reffs\" by criticizing media that doesn't reflect their bias as being biased in itself, and after eroding their target audiences trust in neutral media organizations and eliminating regulations regarding partisan news outlets they dove right in to fox news and state tv for republicans was born. Any divisions their media causes in america actually works for them by hardening their bases view of outsiders. The second is the Kremlin's activities.

They'll predictably do whatever they have to to protect his regime from logical analysis, and destroy any faith the west has in its democratic institutions or even basic human decency. Anything to keep him from being accountable for any of the things that Russia lacks. Then there's the alt-right, who are just fascist thugs by any other name. They're the weakest, but horrible things have small beginnings. Every day they sally forth from the basement of the internet to spread a simple gospel: Muslims are monsters, blacks are violent and ungrateful, and liberals are out to destroy western civilization.

It has little to do with gun laws as explained when he compares the percentage of Canadians who own guns. My takeaway from the film is that, unlike the citizens of the other modern industrialized countries, American's sense of individualism is a value that sets us apart from our fellow citizens; we're all in this alone, not together. Nobody has your back, nobody has your interest in mind, it's sink or swim, go it alone. We view, no I will say we judge, large swaths of our fellow citizens as unworthy, undeserving; Americans are terrified that someone might receive some benefit for something they didn't earn and don't deserve. Our uniquely unfair, disjointed and profit driven medical system, one that no other country values, is a great example.Other countries view their fellow citizens as part of the social order, part of the team. You benefit because your neighbor benefits. Society is vested in the equal success and progress of everyone, not just ther tribe, their party, their unique exclusionary group.Sure enough, who have most of these domestic shooters been; angry disgruntled individuals, loners who feel they are marginalized, set aside, rejects from society.

Kremlin-paid actors sowed division among Americans with fake pages and accounts, inflammatory postings and thousands of paid ads aimed at both liberal and conservative audiences, according to testimony before Congress last week.The Journal analyzed 159,000 deleted tweets from accounts that Twitter identified to congressional investigators as operated by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency.Twitter said it has suspended all 2,752 of the accounts, which removes their tweets from its platform. Congress released the names of the accounts on Nov. 1, during hearings on Russian interference in the 2016 elections.Russia's Sophisticated Efforts to Interfere in 2016 ElectionBased on the information that's now coming out of congressional committees, Russian goals to interfere in the 2016 election were very broad. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains just how sophisticated the Russian efforts were using social media. Photo: APIn the three months after Mr. Trump announced his presidential candidacy on June 16, 2015, tweets from Russian accounts reviewed by the Journal offered far more praise for the real-estate businessman than criticism\u2014by nearly a 10-to-1 margin. At the same time, the accounts generally were hostile to Mrs. Clinton and the early GOP front-runner, Jeb Bush, by equal or greater margins.The Journal pieced together the deleted tweets from data it has collected as well as that provided to the Journal by several researchers. The records contain at least one tweet from more than 2,000 of the accounts.A Twitter Inc. spokeswoman declined to comment. In Senate testimony last week, a Twitter attorney said the company takes seriously \u201cthat the power of our service was misused by a foreign actor for the purpose of influencing the U.S. presidential election,\u201d and said Twitter is beefing up its efforts to combat such activities.Mr. Trump, a regular user of Twitter himself, has called claims that the Russians manipulated the 2016 election via social media \u201ca hoax.\u201d\u201cBOOM! DOWN GOES @jebbush,\u201d wrote @DorothieBell, three weeks after Mr. Trump entered the race. The account, claiming to be run by an American \u201cConservative wife, mother\u201d who wanted to \u201ctake this once great country back!!!,\u201d linked to a Breitbart News article about Mr. Trump attacking Mr. Bush for being soft on immigration.In August, @TamaFlan, claiming to be an American named Tamar Flanagan, tweeted: \u201c#TrumpBecause It\u2019s time for @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton to go quietly into the night #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.\u201dOther accounts criticized Mr. Bush for being a \u201cRINO\u201d (Republican in name only). One offered a succinct put-down: \u201c@JebBush ewww.\u201dThe numerous Russian Twitter attacks on Mrs. Clinton during this three-month period included a tweet comparing her treatment of the press to Adolf Hitler\u2019s, adding: \u201cHeil Hillary.\u201d Another account tweeted links to an editorial\u2014published months earlier\u2014criticizing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cCulture of Corruption.\u201dMany political messages were sent out word-for word by multiple Russian-backed accounts, often within minutes of each other, suggesting a coordinated campaign.Of the Russian-backed accounts that tweeted about Mr. Trump in the summer of 2015, at least 40 served up positive sentiment; just one account captured by the Journal data expressed strong negative opinions.The exception was @Jenn_Abrams, an account that pretended to be run by an opinionated American blogger that eventually attracted 71,000 followers and many media mentions. \u201cI\u2019d rather join #ISIS than have Donald Trump as my president,\u201d that account tweeted on the day Mr. Trump announced his candidacy.It isn\u2019t clear whether the Russian accounts truly backed Mr. Trump from the start, or viewed support for the upstart candidate as an opportunity to disrupt U.S. politics.As the November 2016 election approached, the Kremlin preference for Mr. Trump became even more pronounced. Pro-Trump tweets\u2014either favoring him or attacking his opponent\u2014outnumbered those for Mrs. Clinton by a 30-to-1 ratio in the two weeks before the election, the Journal analysis found. There were about 236 pro-Trump or anti-Clinton tweets captured in the Journal data during those two weeks compared with seven that were pro-Clinton or anti-Trump.Much of the Russian social-media disinformation campaign has been linked to the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, a shadowy, so-called troll farm that spread Russian propaganda across the Internet.Twitter has said the 2,752 Internet Research Agency-operated accounts sent out 131,000 messages on its platform in a 2 1/2-month period around the November election. Messages from a much broader network of automated bot accounts were viewed about 288 million times in that period.Nearly all of that activity has vanished, because Twitter removes all tweets from suspended or deleted accounts and requires its vendors to do the same. That makes it difficult to analyze past behavior; the tweets captured by the Journal represent only a slice of the messages sent out by the troll farm-operated accounts.The Kremlin social-media operation didn\u2019t always favor one U.S. political party, and spanned the ideological spectrum.A Facebook account called Blacktivist claimed to push the Black Lives Matter movement, while an account called Heart of Texas agitated for that state\u2019s secession.The Russian-backed Twitter accounts were so successful at imitating Americans that they were frequently followed and retweeted by prominent people, including Trump campaign insiders, and quoted in mainstream media publications.One such account, @Pamela_Moore13, which claimed to be operated by a Texan who was \u201cConservative. Pro God. Anti Racism,\u201d amassed an impressive 70,000 followers\u2014including retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Fox News commentator Sean Hannity \u2014before being suspended by Twitter in the purge of Russian accounts.An attorney for Mr. Flynn and spokeswoman for Fox didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Before the election, at least 104 of the Russian-controlled accounts, including many of those with tens of thousands of followers, posted hashtags supporting Mr. Trump, including variations of the campaign catchphrase Make America Great Again. More than 90 accounts posted negative messages about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health, emails and alleged corruption. The accounts posted a handful of pro-Clinton hashtags.For the GOP debate on Dec. 15, 2015 in Las Vegas, dozens of the accounts live-tweeted using the hashtag #VegasGOPDebate. Many showed a clear preference for Mr. Trump.\u201cTrump is a real leader, I believe debates will help to see it,\u201d six of the accounts wrote.\u201cOnly Trump can deal with #ISIS,\u201d wrote @MarissaImStrong to its 413 followers.One, @Cheese_Monay, disagreed, tweeting: \u201cWe need real debates not this clown show on #Fox.\u201dOn Election Day, the accounts warned of rigged voting machines and called for an indictment of Mrs. Clinton.As voting wound down that day, @JacquelinIsBest tweeted to its 2,100 followers: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was able to experience our potential president speak at his very last rally. #HillaryForPrison2016 #TrumpForPresident.\u201d", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 24513, "comment_id": "dpfd3nl", "score": 17, "submission_time": "Mon Nov  6 18:00:38 2017", "ups": 17}, {"body": "No collusion, no collusion, YOU'RE the colluder!", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 80334, "comment_id": "dpf5jaf", "score": 16, "submission_time": "Mon Nov  6 14:41:54 2017", "ups": 16}, {"body": "And continues to this very day", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 4580, "comment_id": "dpf7bin", "score": 11, "submission_time": "Mon Nov  6 15:39:09 2017", "ups": 11}, {"body": "Any evidence of Milner's investment in Twitter (before the venture capital firm he owned divested in 2014, shortly before Twitter went public) which resulted in influence over hiring and management decisions or even transfer of intellectual property?

You have out of control oligarchs in one country attempting to influence another countries (ours) election by using their position of power and wealth to persuade or mutually agree to help each other get richer through the exchange of favors like removing sanctions and the Magnitsky Act. We were unduly influenced by the oligarchy in Russia and the oligarchy in our own country goes along with it because the party in charge at the moment is entirely at the whim of the ultra wealthy. Even if they weren\u2019t in on the conspiracy or don\u2019t gain anything from it, they are trying their damndest not to undermine or oust the head of their party who clearly is an inept bafoon who likely broke the law because they need more money, more wealth, more tax breaks. Country means nothing to oligarchs, only more money to acquire more power and more control over the system they intend on worming their way through until their position is firmly entrenched. They do that through deregulation in which the government has been so hobbled that it can\u2019t do anything in the face of clear monopolies and clear abuse of the average citizen. Why do we have arbitration agreements being tossed into all sorts of contracts? Why is that legal? Why are our ISPs not actually serving market needs for competition? Why are there banks that are too big to fail and can act with impunity?  Why was the bailout for banks and large corporations and not for those with student loan or housing debt? Why does post secondary education cost so much to begin with when it used to be much cheaper or even free? Why do 88% of people support universal background checks but nothing gets done? Each issue has its own corporate lobby that keeps us gridlocked and slowly sliding backwards. Now we have ultra wealthy using their money and pouring it into elections to influence the outcome in their favor; Koch Brothers Adleson.  That\u2019s where we are at right now. Unless we right this ship like we did in the early 1900s. The Us is about to become a middling second world country with bloated wealthy at the top consistently using their power in illegal and corrupt ways until they can change the legality of their actions too.

There are resources other than oil, but they don't seem to see it.These people get so excited about the affront to \"common sense\" that conservation supposedly represents, that they don't see the forest for the trees. They don't grasp the interconnected nature of things. You can't have your industrial centers without air for the people to breath. I'm no tree hugger, and prefer the city to the countryside. But even I can see that. So what is this antipathy towards conservation really about? Perhaps most alarmingly, it's not really based in the rationality it pretends to be. The math of saving a handful of jobs versus potentially polluting the air for millions doesn't really add up to begin with and, deep down, I think many know it. It's really about a cultural difference in how the role of government and the value of things is viewed, mixed with reactionary tendencies. And when something is about such core feelings and beliefs, you can't convince someone to abandon it using arguments that favor nature.

Apple came under pressure in 2013 in the US Senate, when CEO Tim Cook was forced to defend its tax system.> In order to keep its tax rates low, Apple needed to find an offshore financial centre that would serve as the tax residency for its Irish subsidiaries.> Apple chose Jersey, a UK Crown dependency that makes its own tax laws and which has a 0% corporate tax rate for foreign companies.*****[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/7b7n6b/apple_the_worlds_most_profitable_firm_has_a/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~241557 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Apple**^#1 **tax**^#2 **Ireland**^#3 **Irish**^#4 **company**^#5", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 745545, "comment_id": "dpfttfp", "score": 3574, "submission_time": "Mon Nov  6 22:52:17 2017", "ups": 3574}, {"body": "*\u201cWe do not depend on tax gimmicks,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe do not stash money on some Caribbean island.\u201d*...", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 14857, "comment_id": "dpg4r6r", "score": 3284, "submission_time": "Tue Nov  7 01:58:00 2017", "ups": 3284}, {"body": "A quarter trillion dollars.
