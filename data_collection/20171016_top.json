He too did not have a way of transport, so we decided to both walk towards one another and meet in the middle. We would both be walking ~5 miles. It was 3am on a cold winter night and I was wearing a black jacket with my hood up.About 2 miles into my hike along the main road, a car  pulled into a parking spot of a home I was passing, just a few feet behind me. He wasn\u2019t entirely into the driveway, almost half way hanging out into the road. I half expected it was just a kind stranger wanting to give me a ride, but I wasn\u2019t about to take any rides from anybody. I kept pacing forward and ignored the car behind me, expecting them to roll down a window and shout at me. It didn\u2019t happen.

I stopped and turned to look at the car. I had a feeling that the person driving was watching me intently.The figure in the car was definitely facing me; I could see the reflection from his dash bouncing off of his eyes. I stared back. I figured he was about to yell out to me, but he just sat quietly in a strangely menacing way that I have only ever seen scenes in movies play out. I kinda did a wave at the figure, letting him know I saw him and waited for some type of communication in return. He didn\u2019t budge, just stared intently. I returned to pacing away, slightly brisker.After just a few moments I could hear the car slowly roll in reverse, so I turned to face it but kept pacing backwards. The car kept creeping, slowly. I pulled down my hood and stood still again, waiting for him to pass me.. but instead the man slowed to a stop beside me. The passenger side window rolled down, and the man and I met eyes. No words were exchanged at all, and before I could even let out a \u201chello?\u201d the man grimaced and accelerated away at a decent pace; almost as if he was disappointed by what he had seen.

I was in the middle of 3rd year university, and a bunch of friends had come down to visit me and my roommate for the festivities. We were all pretty hungover from drinking the night before, and went out for the usual \"nice day out, a bit chilly, I don't feel so good\" post-greasy-breakfast hungover stroll around the neighbourhood.Two of these friends were twin brothers. One of them, we hung out with all the time. The other we'd just met for the first time. He was pretty normal the night before, joining in the fun, but on this day, we were all hanging around a local basketball court shooting hoops with an old basketball we'd found in the grass, and this twin brother kept following me around all over the place with the creepiest grin I'd ever seen in my life. Staring right into the nether regions of my soul, the whole time.I'd back away and join the group again, and he'd keep following me around. When we were walking back to the apartment, it was just me and him walking down the sidewalk behind the group, and he moved over in front of me, stared at me with that creepy look again, and fell down to his knees as if to worship me or something. I didn't know what to do... \"Hey buddy? You all right? We're heading back now, right?\" And so on. He wouldn't say anything - he'd just be there on his knees, looking up at me with a clenched face and squinted eyes, as if he were looking directly into the sun or something.Later that day, my roomie said he was tripping balls, so I thought nothing of it and moved on with my life. A few weeks later, we got a phone call from the twin brother we usually hung out with, and it turned out that this other twin brother went over to his aunt's place with a knife and stabbed her 14 times. She didn't die, but you know, still pretty bad. He had even called the police before going, because he knew he was going to do it but he couldn't stop himself from doing it, because you know, \"the voices\" and so on.The ensuing court case was widely covered in the media as this was a relatively smaller community where this sort of thing doesn't happen on a regular basis. I was reading one of the articles and one of the testimonies was that this twin brother was severely schizophrenic and was hearing voices in his head. He believed to his very bones that his aunt was the devil, and that he had been commanded by God to go and kill her.So, who was this \"God\" that told him to go kill her? Well, as the newspaper article described, it was a guy in a group he hung out with on New Year's Day. Didn't take me long to realize that he was talking about me. This was 22 years ago. I know for a fact it was a mental illness, but just knowing that I had somehow \"commanded\" him to go kill his aunt stays with me to this day.EDIT: Holy smokes, didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. To address some oft-repeated questions: 1) No, the cops never questioned me, and I'm actually now wondering why not. It makes sense that they would, right? 2) Some people wondered if this was just a made-up story and wanted proof, i.e. a link to the article I'm talking about. Well, I sent an email to the newspaper to see if they have anything in their digital archives, but more important to mention right now: this was 1995. The internet was hardly anything at the time. We students were still researching via books at the library and physically writing and handing in our essays and term papers. That being said, I'm searching and will put something here if I can find anything.EDIT 2: Found something buried in this: http://archive.hmvh.net/txtfiles/various/ARCH_952.TXT - search for \"Delange\" and you'll find a story there.

I confided in someone else at the company about what had happened, and I got a telling off (by someone else in management) because apparently I was \"spreading malicious rumours, and we will not have gossiping and bitchiness here\". That was the first but not the last time something like this happened, and in various companies, various jobs. I've developed a thick skin now, but I'm now overly guarded against people who are probably just being friendly.\u00a0It's possible that she's playing dumb, but knowing her, I think it's more likely that she's in denial. She's learnt to be polite but to keep her guard up against the younger guys (including some guys pretty high up).

That night, when I was walking past a dark stretch of road to get home, I saw it. I first felt someone watching me and kept looking over my shoulder, then the feeling got stronger like someone was right behind me. The next time I turned my head there was a black humanoid entity just barely within my peripheral vision and standing a ways back, following me. At first I thought it was just a shadow from the trees but the more I turned to look the closer it seemed to get. By the time my apartment building came within sight it was only about one street lamp away (I suck at judging distances). I totally lost my shit at that point and full on sprinted into my house, and I'm pretty sure that thing followed me, at least until my doorway. It was only after I passed the big cross hanging on my door that the feeling subsided a bit.Over the next few weeks the thing was still there and still following me. It never appeared in the day but when I looked out my window at night, it was always just within my peripheral vision, and when I turned to look it was gone. The worst was when I went to the gym every night. My gym has floor to ceiling windows on one side that overlooks a road and the pathway outside. This thing would stand in the window pretty much visibly, just staring at me as I worked out. I tried to take pictures multiple times but the contrast of the light in the gym and the dark path outside always made the picture dark and blurry and the thing invisible. I was also too much of a pussy to approach the window and tried to look in the other direction. (Granted the added adrenaline did make for some of my best workouts.)It carried on for 2-3 weeks and then one day it just stopped. I just woke up feeling some sense of relief that I couldn't put a finger on. Then throughout the day I realised the thing wasn't there anymore, and it was confirmed when I went to the gym again that night. It had just disappeared.Until now I haven't been able to explain any of it. If it were just a sighting once or twice I would of convinced myself it was a shadow or some play on light, but this entity followed me around for almost a month and I saw it almost every night.

I had already been dealing with him not paying bills etc. We didn\u2019t have heat on in the house in the middle of winter....I was a mess at the time, only having my beloved dog with me. It was about 48 degrees in our house, so her and I stayed in my bedroom where I had a space heater. I tried to OD, I drank near a 5th of whiskey, took a few Xanax and morphine.

Fast forward to now, her mental health issues are taking a toll. She is a drunk, meth user, and gambling addict. When she calls me it is like someone I dont even know. Last week she was in the hospital for a heart attack, and I really wish she would just die. I lost her when I was a kid. I feel like this other is an imposter, and I just want it to die and for her, and I'm not gonna lie, my, pain to end.   Edit: I just want to say that the response to this post has been a mixture of sadness and happiness for me. I would like to give a somewhat brief overview to my story, and perhaps it will help others. I don't remember when the sexual abuse started. But my earliest memories are of it occurring. Here is a funny joke. What does someone who wears glasses and someone who is sexually abused from an early age have in common? They think how they see the world is normal. I never thought to question anything, ever. For a number of years. I was a quiet child and didn't make many friends because people scared me. By the time I realized something was terribly wrong in my household, I refused to let the few friends I did have over. I have a very vivid memory of being small, I must have been around four, because my younger brother was an infant. My mother had taken the three of us into one of the bedrooms and locked the door while her boyfriend smashed things downstairs, and was just losing his mind(he was a meth head too)he had a cattle prod and I could hear the crackling of the electricity through the walls. My mom had burns from it all over her arms. She asked me, a small child, if I would call the police if he broke in. I started crying, and begged her to please not make me. That I would get in trouble, and he would hurt me and I was scared. She asked me, \"Do you want me to die?\" Those words are so clear in my mind, I can still hear it perfectly. To this day I have nightmares of having to call 911, and not being able to speak, or pushing the wrong buttons. The abuse became worse. Every trip to the hospital was an accident. Every public outburst was treated as a parent having to wrangle an unruly young kid. I tried to run away in the winter. I packed some clothes in my little backpack and went out onto the ice of a river near our house. I laid down out in the middle, in the cold, and day dreamed. Just watching the snow fall down. I was nice and warm in my coat and multi layered pants(my parents would never buy a snowsuit for me). But I went back. Because I was scared of what would happen to my mom. Her boyfriend always told me that if I ran away, he would kill her and my brother, and keep me alive so that I would have the memory. I stayed until I was 14 and he tried to drown me in dirty dish water. I ran, and started living at a friends house. My mom would call constantly, begging me to come back. That things had gotten so much worse for her. But I was too afraid, and the guilt piled up. He ended up leaving when I was 18. I have not talked to him since. I consider the time I was around him like a terrible, horrible nightmare. My mother spiraled. What was once a functional alcoholic turned I to a complete mess. She turned to prostetution to subsidize her addiction. She lived on the streets, and every time I moved and slowly got better, she would call and ask for money. I gave in to that for a long time. I was hospitalized and diagnosed with a number of mental disorders. She called me a malingerer, and that my pain was nothing in comparison to her own. I got married, and had two wonderful children. She tells me my husband Wil leave because I am crazy, that my children will grow to be addicts, and that I am her clone. That I can't escape it. She is like a voice in my head, berating me. While at the same time working her way back in like some sort of abusive spouse. When I listen to music intended for exes, it makes me think of her. Adele's Hello, is about my mom for me. To everyone who has dealt with a similar situation, you are amazing. You are strong. You will get through this. When I was young, every fucking day was hell. I thought it would never fucking end. But it did. It WILL get better. You just have to make it better. Also, I do see a psychologist, CBT, and DBT, and regular doc for my trauma and medication. I love you all. I dont know who the hell you are, or what you have been through, but I love you.   More edit: To every comment that said I won't read your comment, I do. I read every one. Keep them coming. Its just dinner time, and I have to make my children foods, so I can't respond right away.  Another edit: To the people saying, \"I didn't have it this bad.\" Or \"Wow, what I went through is nothing in comparison.\" Stop it. You just stop it right now!You have pain. You are allowed to feel it without feeling bad and putting up against another person's pain and suffering as some sort of weird comparison tool. We dont sit around comparing our joys do we?

We don't have much in common and she's not nearly as attractive. She would be close if she lost 50 pounds or so though. Even though we don't have much in common, we have amazing conversations. We also have completely differing views and she doesn't listen to my beck and call like my original girlfriend. Opposites attract I guess. They both fulfill different purposes. I also sometimes fuck girls on the side as well. It's so easy and feels fucking amazing to have so many girls want you. I know I have to choose one eventually.

I'm fucking tired of those stupid, [ass-obsessed bears](https://imgur.com/8LHlePx). I don't let toilet paper control my fucking life. Their entire world revolves around toilet paper. I get that they are in a commercial, but ass-inspection? Really? That is a little too far. They [pause football games](https://imgur.com/xhpNxAB) to inspect asses. One commercial has them ready to change vacation plans [over toilet paper](https://imgur.com/EuwXlmq). And speaking of traveling bears, one commercial features [a TSA bear inspecting another's ass](https://imgur.com/LOiKqjX) before boarding a plane. Even going so far as to commend the bear on [packing Charmin](https://imgur.com/ezdWITD) (\"You're cleaner than I thought,\" says the agent). Ass-inspection in the Charmin bear universe is so commonplace that it is enforced as a security measure. [Here](https://imgur.com/dt40qZb) a bear is chasing a cub around with a dustpan to collect used toilet paper stuck to the cub's ass. The narrator says, \"You'll never pass inspection with pieces left behind.\" Is Charmin trying to push an ass-inspection agenda? I hope to never have to endure a toilet paper inspection, let alone be subjected to it every time I use the restroom. [Here](https://imgur.com/p4XQenb) a cub is literally doing gymnastics to make sure he doesn't fail his ass-inspection but to no avail. These bears are relentless. They will scrutinize each other's asses at any given opportunity. Even in print, they resort to [using a vacuum cleaner](https://imgur.com/eQGpRVu) to clean other bears asses.  Look at [this commercial](https://imgur.com/pU4oi65), a mother and cub looking at \"the Moon\". In any sane family, that would be the satellite that orbits the Earth. Unfortunately, this is Charmin Bear world, where it not only means the cosmic body, but the body of their [fellow bear](https://imgur.com/Vpbznmf). They are literally using a telescope to inspect the ass of another bear sitting in a tree. These bears are so incredibly self-centered too. All they care about is *toilet paper*. In [this commercial](https://imgur.com/XUcH71o) the cub drains an entire lake so he wouldn't have to fish. Of course, he uses the toilet paper in the tackle box because these bears don't go anywhere without a fucking roll of toilet paper. It doesn't even make sense. Is Charmin advocating destroying an entire lake to catch all the fish? It seems a little misguided.This commercial ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x95aXcg8nsQ)) features a bunch of cubs saying that Charmin is so good, you could wear your underwear \"a second day\". Mind you, all these cubs [are naked](https://imgur.com/UG1UZXG)! The commercial ends with one cubs saying to another, \"You should try it Skids.\" Do these bears really make up nicknames based on the cleanliness of each other's asses? What kind of fucked up world is it where naked bears make fun of each other for ass appearance? Especially the one where one bear says \"what a great view\" and the other [sticks his bare bear ass](https://imgur.com/PRAU4Lv) in her face and says \"thanks to Charmin\". It's fucking weird. Fuck those bears. I will never buy Charmin as long as those bears are waving their asses at me. Edited to include examples.

Because then they'd have to claim responsibility for you as a patient and put themselves in a position to potentially be sued by someone they haven't even *seen* in person.So why are they signing off on cases so people can receive these aligners via mail? They get paid by these companies to do so.People just don't get it. We have patients who have tried this come in here and wonder why their bite is worse than where it started or why they have major overjet now. \"Well it was just meant to fix **one** tooth\".It's never one tooth folks. You're whole mouth is involved when teeth starting moving which is why x-rays are important so if there's a short root, we know before putting you in treatment because the possibility of losing it during treatment is there. Or if there's other issues that need to be addressed, we can fix that *before* putting you in Invisalign and braces.Orthodontics should be treated like any other medical or dental procedure. If you wouldn't give yourself a root canal or perform surgery on yourself, don't move you're teeth on your own. See a professional, and if you decide to take the DIY route, make sure you put some money aside for the ortho you'll be seeing after to fix the open bite you didn't have to begin with.Edit: Grammar", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 20716, "stickied": false, "score": 367, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 16 20:34:18 2017", "ups": 367}, {"body": "I don't have anything too bad but I was working visitation at a nursing home where they didn't have a policy to count medication.

At the time, she didn't give us a reason or explanation until I physically saw my grandma for myself.  My grandpa, from whom she had separated from a few years prior, passed away. Grandma moved back into their home and cut off contact with my mom. Mom got concerned and decided to just drop in and check on her while mom and I were out running errands.  I was around 10 at this point.The entire house was empty except for a bare mattress on the living room floor. My grandma was semi-conscious on the mattress, which was stained with urine and vomit. Liquor bottles and beer cans were everywhere. She was no longer of a healthy weight; basically skin and bones. She weighed about 80 pounds, at 5'6\". I remember trying to get her to eat while mom called an ambulance. She ate a few bites of bread before vomiting. Grandma was combative and aggressive, and was committed on a 72 hour hold.  She agreed to go to rehab, for I believe the 3rd time.After her release, she moved across the country to stay with her sibling. A few more years pass with no contact. Mom found out grandma had moved back to our town without telling anyone in the family. By the time we learned of her return, she had gotten an apartment and a job, successfully becoming a functioning alcoholic.  The drinking progressed and she again lost her job.  Somehow mom learned of her return and had a surprise visit. I was maybe 11 or 12 at this point, and was with my parents when they showed up at her apt.  The place was trashed with vodka bottles and beer cans. This time, mom just let her go. I didn't see our speak to grandma for about 4 years.  My aunt had a miracle baby which brought grandma back into our lives. At this point, she was sober and stable. Everything seemed like it was coming back together; she was welcomed back into our lives and slowly trust was rebuilt, as was our relationship with her.After being sober for several years, grandma receive a stage 3 cancer diagnosis. She admitted to us that she coped with the news by drinking a bottle of vodka.  She said she woke up the next day feeling like hell and decided she didn't want to go out like that.  She restarted her sobriety and opted for chemotherapy and radiation. A little over a year later, she was in remission.That was 10 years ago. She is still sober.  Recently, she had a terrible case of pneumonia and had to be in the hospital for several weeks followed by a 2 month stay in a nursing facility. My husband and I visited her there, and I had a break down when I saw her.  She looked so sickly and frail - it reminded me of when she was drinking. I couldn't stop my myself from crying. She just held my hand and told me everything would be OK.Currently, she is well enough to live on her own.

In that time, there has been oppression and fighting in all of those countries and they have long been pushing for their own homeland.The Iraqi Kurds recently voted for independence from Iraq, however the Government essentially doesn't recognise them. Tensions are simmering at the moment, but there is a big potential for conflict. In the meantime however, the Kurds in the other countries are pushing for independence. Especially if the Iraqi Kurds get their own land, the others are likely to push even stronger for it. So imagine independence movements popping up against the regimes in Iran and Turkey.What further complicates the matters is that not all Kurds agree with how a possible Kurdistan could function or operate, so even with independence there could still be strong disagreements.

Games department mostly, but switched to rides near the end. The best workplace event was Harbor Night -sometime in July, after the park closed for the day, limited attractions in Hurricane Harbor would be open to the employees for a couple hours (people working the event got time and a half, I think). Water rides at night are exhilirating as fuck, and it was generally fun to relax with your coworkers. We'd occasionally have ride nights, where certain rides (usually just a rollercoaster and maybe another attraction) would stay open after close, as a reward for hard work/compliments from guests/etc. The perks in general were sweet especially for teenagers. Free parking, free admission for you plus one more, occasional free tickets to bring your family, discounts everywhere. Well worth minimum wage, at least at that stage in your life, tbqh. I liked working there.One story that comes to mind was when I was working a game that involved throwing baseballs at plastic plates. You got 3 throws, and if you broke 2/3 you got a decent prize; 3/3 a large one (kids could win a small prize for breaking one plate). Lots of people said it was rigged, jokingly or otherwise; I'd bring a plate to them and let them break it with their bare hands to show it wasn't, and was also pretty generous about points (did you tap the plate? Close enough for me!). Game's hard as hell, though, even when I was generous as I was. One of the large prizes on this particular day was a big Pikachu. Guy came up to me, determined to win it. He said he was a teacher, he wanted it for his classroom. I thought that was pretty awesome of him. Poor guy couldn't aim worth a damn. Each play was $3. He'd miss all three, another $3, hit one, miss two. Hit, miss, miss. Miss, hit, miss. Miss, miss, miss. Must've spent $30-40 bucks, maybe more, I lost track - it was certainly far more than the park likely spent on the Pikachu. And he showed no signs of stopping. He really wanted the damn thing. Miss, miss, hit. Okay, I gotta cut this guy a break. So I walked back to the plates, grabbed one at random, broke it in half. Grabbed another and snapped it too, let him have the Pikachu.

This dad did not like that I refused to put his light child on the line just to have to climb out to rescue him after he got stuck. After a series of yelling and cursing I called my manager/GM and he tried to calm this guy down by offering him vouchers or other attractions etc.None of this was good enough and apparently the 10 second ride was going to be better than close to $145 worth of free stuff. After 10 minutes of him getting very angry he insisted that I (the kid who refused to let his son go) meet him in the parking lot to \u201csettle this\u201d. My boss responded by calling security. This enraged the guy so much he tried to jump over the rope to get to the deck (landing platform for the zipline) where I was. Little did this idiot know was that the rope was there to stop people from stepping into the gap between the deck and anchors that held the lines down. Well mister angry jumped over the rope fists up ready to swing at me. Only to jump right into the small hole in between the deck and anchors breaking one ankles and falling forward only to smash his face right on the railing of the deck I was standing on.Best part of all of this. My actual position at this resort was a rescue guide. Being the only guide on the zipline that day and the closest person to the guy when he got hurt I immediately jumped up to help and administer any first aid if needed. Him being half conscious from the blow to the head didn\u2019t remember I was the kid who bandaged his cuts. About a week later we received a letter from him thanking the guy who helped him but also asking for the firing of the kid who refused to let his kid go down the zip-line.Quick addition to this post.In addition to this being an action adventure park it was also a ski resort in the winter.

Anyways I'm fixing the hats fixture that's in front of the mirror with my back to said mirror, when I suddenly hear a loud crash and the sound of shattered glass from right behind me. I turn around and I see this kid sitting on the bench in front of the now broken mirror with a dazed look. There was broken glass everywhere, on the bench on the floor around him on his clothes, you name it. Kid also had a giant deep gash above his left elbow with blood pooling out and dripping  around him, and there was bits of broken glass in his gash. Unfortunately his mother did not see that her son had a giant bloody gash on his arm, just that her son was sitting there with a shocked dazed look, so she reaches out to help him up. She unfortunately grabs her son right where the bloody gash is and lifts him up, while probably pushing the glass deeper into his wound. It wasn't until she helped him up and realized that her son was wincing and her hand was a bloody mess that she realized what was happening to her son, and became speechless. Dazed shocked kid never uttered a sound during this whole time. Poor kid.I cleared the surrounding area, called my management team, security, the theme park duty manager, along with first aid to come to the scene. While we waited, I gave the kid and mother some wipes to clean off the blood their hands, but we weren't allowed to do much else other than clean some of the broken glass up until first aid and the nurses arrived. We got them temporarily fixed up and we got the kid to the hospital, from what I hear he's doing ok now. Unfortunately, we lost our beautiful old opening day mirror.We do have a small joke now, because this happened on the day D (an old cast member who had been working at the shop for 46 years) announced her retirement for a few weeks down the road. Now we all joke around with D saying that the mirror got out the Disney before she even did.

Honestly, I think he gets into trouble on purpose now, since hes spent most of his life there he hasn't spent enough time out for him to retire or clean up now. Still, I have a hope chest covered top to bottom in carved birds and flowers, and its one of the nicest things I've ever seen, let alone owned.

I was 20, she was 17. I would go to her highschool and pretend to be a student, I learned her schedule and infiltrated her inner circle, all in the hopes of one day wooing her. It backfired, one of her guy friends made up a story about me and I was sent to six months hard time.While behind bars, my systematic detective skills proved extremely useful. I was able to quickly analyze the social hierarchy and avoided falling in with the wrong groups (whether that be the weak or the overly-violent).Within a month I was able to form a connection with a guard who could pull information on inmates as requested. Information is invaluable behind bars, just like it is in the outside world. I made a pretty penny selling information to gang leaders. It was difficult keeping my hands clean, but I think I managed very well for what I was doing. Everyone knew I was a rat, so there was no surprise or resentment toward me or my activities. I was like Petyr Baelish from GoT, except I didn\u2019t (SPOILER) get my throat slit; I was released and able to return to the love of my life.I pulled up to her house at approximately 4AM. I knew where her room was located but there wasn\u2019t external access since there was nothing to climb near her window. My only options were the front door or her parents room, which was conveniently located above the patio trellis. Since I\u2019m light on my feet, I decided to go with the latter.I climbed atop the trellis like a gymnast-chimpanzee, quietly opened the parent\u2019s window and crept inside. It was dark and still. I could hear the pair of heavy breathing coming from the bed. A perfect couple.I lightly kissed the father\u2019s lips and waltzed into the hallway. Her room was at the very end of the hall. A pink flower with her name hung from the door. When I saw it my chest felt weak. I was so excited. One step. Two step. Three. I could faintly smell her perfume. Four step. Five step. Six. My breath hit the wooden door, the only thing separating us. I turned the knob, stepped in and closed the door behind me.That\u2019s the last thing I remember really. The police and media say that I danced around the streets in her skin that evening. I think I would remember something like that. How magical that would be.I\u2019ll be spending a lot of time in here, but unfortunately my detective skills will no longer serve me since I am to receive the death penalty. They have me locked up by myself, can you believe that? Limited visitation; I don\u2019t even get to go outside.I saved part of her. I snuck it in by hiding it somewhere they would never find it.

Well he managed to put both his brains and artistic abilities to use in prison as a tattoo artist. He was in a minimum security prison because it was his first offense and he was non-violent, and was able to get tattoo ink smuggled in. He fashioned a tattoo gun from a needle, a half broken portable CD player, a ballpoint pen, and some miscellaneous junk he found or traded smokes for. He had very little experience tattooing, so he started on himself, but lo and behold he was one of those people that just had a natural affinity for it.Over the course of several months he gave himself sleeves on both of his arms, depicting djinn, lost temples, elvish princesses, and stunning landscapes for these creatures to inhabit. Once everyone saw his work he became everyone's go-to tattoo guy. Through that he basically gained an immunity of sorts. He would trade tattoos for supplies, food, creature comforts, and protection. He would then trade material goods for more tattoo ink and eventually got a real tattoo gun smuggled in. When he was released, he went on to use the skills he picked up in prison to start up his own tattoo shop and has been fairly successful.

Wrists like little branches. Anyway, my partner and I got called out there every weekend, and one of us would pull her aside and say \"come on, tonight\u2019s the night we press charges.\" And this wasn\u2019t one of those deep-down he-loves-me set-ups \u2014 we get a lot of those \u2014 but not this. This girl was scared. She wasn\u2019t going to cross him, no way, no how. Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMT\u2019s, put him in a car and drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank. He sleeps it off, next morning out he goes. Back home.But one night, my partner\u2019s out sick, and it\u2019s just me. And the call comes in and it\u2019s the usual crap. Broke her nose in the shower kind of thing. So I cuff him, put him in the car and away we go. Only that night, we\u2019re driving into town, and this sideways asshole is in my back seat humming \"Danny Boy.\" And it just rubbed me wrong. So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere. And I kneel him down, and I put my revolver in his mouth, and I told him, \"This is it. This is how it ends.\" And he\u2019s crying, going to the bathroom all over himself, swearing to God he\u2019s going to leave her alone. Screaming \u2026 as much as you can with a gun in your mouth. And I told him to be quiet. Cause I needed to think about what I was going to do here. And of course he got quiet. Goes still. And real quiet. Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps. And we just stood there for a while, me acting like I\u2019m thinking things over, and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants. And after a few minutes I took the gun out of his mouth, and I say, \"So help me if you touch her again I will such-and-such and such-and-such and blah blah blah blah blah\".Just trying to do the right thing.

Anyway, my partner and I got called out there every weekend, and one of us would pull her aside and say \"come on, tonight\u2019s the night we press charges.\" And this wasn\u2019t one of those deep-down he-loves-me set-ups \u2014 we get a lot of those \u2014 but not this.

It was seriously the most heart breaking moment of my career. He was a notorious felon who'd been evading law enforcement officers for years in about 14 different counties. He pretty much was our on-going suspect from cases ranging from when he was a young man to even as recent as weeks prior. I was tasked with heading up the response for it around 5 years ago. And it encompassed a large portion of my life. He always managed to stay one step ahead despite being a brash, impulsive, drunk - he was also smart. Easily the smartest person I'd ever encountered. But after all that, after the dead periods where we didn't hear anything about him, the ups and downs, my marriage crumbling and my daughter growing up without me in her life for a large part of it - it was all coming down to this. October 4th, 2015. My office received a tip from one of his relatives that he was hiding out in a nearby tavern, right under our noses. We pulled up on the tavern, secured the perimeter, and announced our presence. It was a moment I'd been waiting for, for a long time. I had my firearm drawn, we all did, expecting the worst. I told my men to be ready, since the suspect was known to be armed. Seconds later the doors opened. My heart was racing like someone was taking a jackhammer and blasting it into my chest. There he was. There he fucking was. Not a word. Not a single word. He had his arms in the air and the most blank stare I'd ever seen. We got him. He gave up. And while we celebrated that we caught him, something just rubbed me the wrong way about it. It was all too easy. It was like after all this time of evading us, of being one step ahead, he just gave up. I went back to the tavern to investigate. Evidence had collected a photo he had dropped. The bartender and other patrons noted that he was just staring at it for the entire time he was there while he drank. Then he threw it on the ground. The photo was a picture of him and his friends. And then it started clicking in my head. I began piecing it together. It dawned on me what exactly we were dealing with. The importance of this photo was it showed a different side of the perpetrator than we'd ever been exposed to. You see his friends in the photo were all deceased. A few days prior in a joint-task force raid my department tried to make a move on him in a public setting. Basically a special agent for the bureau, with whom we were working, led an operation where she was entrenched with his friend group. They held a fake wedding to try and ensnare our guy. He got tipped off and the whole thing ended up in a shootout. We prevailed and took out most of his friends, but he'd gotten away. He clearly was depressed since he had this photo with him. It wasn't my proudest moment.  But I began feeling sorry for him.My mind raced back to the call. Now it seemed more important than ever. I went back to the office and played it back over and over again. My partner started thinking I was crazy. \"It's his voice.\" I said. \"It's his fucking voice\". You see it wasn't his son-in-law who turned him in like we all were led to believe. It was him. He turned himself in. I was shocked. This criminal mastermind, the man who had been eluding us for years, found himself alone and depressed and turned himself in.  Part of the deal was that his family would be granted a full pardon, that they were his hostages. He orchestrated all of it.An overwhelming sadness hit me that day, to realize there was some humanity to this great evil that had plagued us. That he was willing to turn himself in to save his family and give them a second chance. That he, through the deaths of his friends, was alone. It was heartbreaking. I'd tried to talk to him, but they booked him for prison immediately. Like that, he was gone from the station. I didn't get any answers. The questions were greater than anything we could piece together. I thought I had answered *why?* But until I could get something from him, it was all just speculation. Anyway, that is how I arrested Rick Sanchez.

The first is that I am a combat veteran. I was a medic in Iraq and Afghanistan. I can handle myself in a tricky situation.The second is that I am terrible with women. in the Pepsi Challenge that is the dating game I am more like the Shasta or the RC. I am the Jitney Jingle to the Wal Mart. I am the Mad Catz controller that has the sticky A Button that you always pass to your friends because you're not losing at Golden Eye again, god dammit.Knowing that, I can tell you this. I picked up a girl in a bar. This was a terribly uncommon thing for me. It was about 230 am and last call was coming and this woman walks up to me and says \"Hey, I am Shana. You're cute.\" Well hey there Shana, I'm Stu it is mighty nice to meet you. \"Stu, you're cute. Did you know that my tits are real?\"I did not know that\"You should give them a feel.\"At this point I feel like I should have known better but 1.) I was drunk. 2.) She was offering. 3.) If that was how they shook hands in her culture I didn't want to seem rude.Well yes Shana, they are real.\"Stu, where do you live?\"Nearby\"You should show me\"20 minutes later we are in my bedroom doing what consenting adults do and she is on top of me. As things are going she gets this sort of twinkle in her eye and, biting her lip, she stands up.When a new thing happens to you your brain has to filter the information to try and help make sense of it. For me the \"Hey, I'm getting pissed on filter\" came about 8 seconds into a 12 second stream. I basically roll out of bed and go \"What the FUCK are you doing?\"She has the audacity to look at me like I'm the asshole in this situation and basically screams \"What? I thought it would be something you were into.\"Now, I am not one to kink shame. If it makes you happy and everyone agrees then by all means have yourself a good time in your relationship. Notice I say relationship, because piss is a relationship thing. You have to plan it out, there's logistics.\"Hey babe, next Tuesday, drink a lot of water, lock up the dogs, break out the guest towels and tarp (because we are using our nice monogrammed towels that my aunt got us.)\" There is a LOT of communication that has to occur for two people to agree to those circumstances and at no point did I say \"Hey you, piss on me.\" and I feel like that is more than can get passed through a wink, nod, nudge or glance. So I get her out of my apartment and suddenly it is 4 am and I am faced with the single most shameful experience of my life which is washing off someone else's piss in my shower. Dove and tears don't mix.At least I THOUGHT it was the most shameful thing until I leave the bathroom and realize that I am a sad bachelor and my only set of bed sheets are now covered in someone else's piss that I have to take to the public washers (because en suite is expensive) to wash.

The session will take place after ESO's press conference on **16 October 2017 at 16:00 CEST (10 AM ET)**, which can be watched live at [www.eso.org/live](https://www.eso.org/public/live/).-----SummaryESO's fleet of telescopes in Chile have detected the first visible counterpart to a gravitational wave source. These historic observations suggest that this unique object is the result of the merger of two neutron stars. The cataclysmic aftermaths of this kind of merger \u2014 long-predicted events called kilonovae \u2014 disperse heavy elements such as gold and platinum throughout the Universe. This discovery, published in several papers in the journal Nature and elsewhere, also provides the strongest evidence yet that short-duration gamma-ray bursts are caused by mergers of neutron stars.Besides the science, the collaborative global effort to make this discovery possible was also very interesting. On 17 August 2017 a gravitational wave event was detected. About two seconds later, two space observatories detected a short gamma-ray burst from the same area of the sky. As night fell in Chile ESO's  telescopes as well as many others, peered at this patch of sky, pinpointing the source in visible and infrared light. Observations continued as night arrived in Hawaii, as well as for weeks after around the globe.Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1733/Guests:* Stephen Smartt, Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the Queen\u2019s University Belfast. He can take questions on the electromagnetic event, kilonova, r-process, chemical enrichment, heavy elements, telescopes and surveys, finding kilonovae.* Joe Lyman, Post-doctoral researcher at the University of Warwick. He can take questions on the host galaxy and environment of the kilonova, as well as the observations done at ESO\u2019s La Silla Observatory.* Marina Rejkuba, Associate Astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and head of ESO's User Support Department. She can take questions on ESO, telescopes, instruments, and generally the observations carried out for this event.* Andrew Levan, Professor of Physics at the University of Warwick. He can take questions on neutron star mergers and electromagnetic follow-up from gamma-ray to radio, observations from the facilities of the European Southern Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope.* Paolo A. Mazzali, Professor of Astronomy, Astrophysics Research Institute, Liverpool John Moores University and Max-Planck Institute for Astrophysics.* Avneet Singh, Doctoral researcher, Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Gravitationsphysik (Albert-Einstein-Institut).

I have *no* earthly clue how they must be processing the reconciliation of Fox News talking about Hillary Clinton and Harvey Weinstein all the live long day with what they must be hearing from people they actually know in real life. In my wildest dreams, they are finally waking the hell up. I can only hope. EDIT 12 hours later, because this post somehow took off when I was only waking up myself and giving minimal content:This is an extension of something I shared this morning ... but basically, Puertorrique\u00f1os can't vote unless they have residency on the mainland, Trump had a failed golf course there, and they're not anyone his \"base\" cares about.Personally, my guess is that it's the golf course. Trump had a bad experience there, and his whole game is revenge on those who have slighted him, or those he feels have not treated him properly.Unfortunately, this is now petty revenge on 3.5 million human beings.My in-laws have had a retirement home in PR for the last 20 years. I've been there many times with them, easily a dozen or more weeks over time. Probably several more times than that. I know where the local Walmart is, and the grocery store, and I know how to find my way to El Junque.My in-laws themselves go 4-6 times a year, up until this past summer, and they had a massive family vacation scheduled in a few months. They're not going now.I consider them to be good people whom I love dearly. But they are Trump voters in a bubble. They watch Fox News.Earlier this spring I mentioned how I didn't think Trump was up to this job and my MIL said \"well, you do know he's a billionaire, he didn't get there by not knowing what he's doing.\"I said, \"but you can't run a country like a company ...\"And then someone else immediately intervened to change the subject. We don't talk politics at the table on holidays, or, really, ever. They are a very loving family, but I guess have always been some exotic \"hothouse\" flower in their midst, being from California.I know they are getting updates from their rental agent, who is actually living in their home with his family because his own home was destroyed. The home flooded and many glass doors and windows are cracked and shattered (flying coconuts, no joke), no running water, and the surrounding gated community is crippled.I don't know how they are dealing with this because my husband says we shouldn't ask them, they will consider it my \"piling on\" in their time of uncertainty and loss. But they haven't said anything in 3 plus weeks.I do wonder how they are processing that their favorite, news source, Fox, is definitely not covering the extent of the unfolding mess.They have to know that everything is, indeed, not fine at all.At least I hope so, because in a repeat performance of last year, perhaps I don't know as much about the world or people I thought I knew, as much as I thought I did.And that's alternately both scary and depressing.Also, although I have video and pictures to verify to any mod, I honestly think they could go both ways.

And while I think that is valuable, I really just right now need to hear from the people who already share my frustration with patriarchy and who are already feminists. How do you cope?Here's my question/anecdote/rant. Sorry in advance that it's stupid, but I just hit a weird breaking point over something minor, and I'm really thinking to myself, how do I get on??I just don't know how to take it anymore. This is stupid, but I just got back from seeing Blade Runner with my boyfriend and another couple. I don't care to talk about the movie right now, but it's full of really misogynistic scenes- literally every scene that includes a woman character. I kept trying to ignore it and get into the film, but the misogyny just kept pulling me out of it, and it's so long. By the end I was just so ready for it to be over so we could get on with our lives.As soon as the film was over, the other woman said something that made me realize she felt the same way I did so we laughed and ranted a bit about what a misogynistic film it was. Our two partners agreed with us, but they said mostly it didn't bother them and they were able to enjoy the film. We dropped it at that.Later at home and after a few drinks, I started to think about it again, and I asked my bf how he could've enjoyed the film or not noticed all the things I noticed. He said he noticed some of them but was mostly wrapped up in the film and not interested in analyzing it from a feminist point of view. I said I wasn't either (I seriously wasnt) but that the movie kept pulling me out of it by showing something awful and misogynistic every single scene so I couldn't just relax and stop thinking about it. He said he didn't feel this way and couldn't relate. Because my partner is black, I tried to personalize it. I said, what if every single scene that involved a black character, they were playing around with some terrible racist stereotype like wearing black face and eating watermelon- something just blatant and bigoted like that. Would he have been able to just ignore that or not notice and instead enjoy the film? He says no, he hadn't thought of it that way. But the point is of course that he didn't.This is a really minor thing, and who cares right? But I'm having trouble shaking how depressed it's gotten me. And it's not about a stupid movie night. All the shit that is going on right now- the fight for coverage of birth control like any other drug, the fight for abortion access, the politicians lately who've said men shouldn't have to contribute to insurance coverage for prenatal care, the high maternal mortality rate among women of color, the current detention of pregnant immigrants and prevention of some of them to receive health care, the expiration of CHIP, assholes misogynists like our current president and administration, the Weinstein shit, cases like that Brock Turner asshole, it's like it just never stops. And then when I'm out and about in real life with decent men that I care about who are feminists, they don't even notice that a movie that revolves around sex bot housewife servants and defining human by the ability to reproduce and several scenes in which they slice open uteruses and discuss violent death in childbirth, they aren't even troubled enough to notice that it's really disturbing and misogynistic?I feel like it's the straw that breaks the camel's back- it's not a serious thing.

As I looked around for help, my eyes found Nathan, another boy on my trip. He was laughing. I just stayed where I was. When we left the crowd, I was pulled aside by the adult chaperones.

She pulled up to a pump and glanced around, seeing no one. After she started pumping she noticed a man a ways off, walking from the direction of a known-to-be-sketchy motel (read: a regular motel). She wasn't too worried as she could see him and he was still across a couple of parking lots, so she thought she'd be finished if he meandered toward her. My friend got too comfortable, I guess, because all of a sudden she realized she had stopped watching him at some point and didn't see him. A car came speeding out of nowhere, roaring into the station and slamming on their brakes next to a pump that was on the opposite side of my friend, a few pumps over. She got really uneasy watching this car come in, and then they just sat there, in their car not getting out. She jumped in her car (gas pump still in her tank) and sat there, hoping they'd drive off. A few minutes went by, and she notices the man she saw earlier walking back toward the hotel. While she was watching him, the car started up again and drove next to my friend. They rolled the window down and said they are glad she is ok. Confused, my friend asked why. Apparently when she was pumping and lost sight of the man, he took off in a dead sprint toward her, hidden from view behind the pump. He was crouching down behind her pump when the car pulled in, as they had seen the whole thing. Where the car had parked, the people could see the man just squatting there the whole time, making pissed off faces at them (I'm guessing for ruining his scheme) before he finally gave up and turned back around.

It was 11:45 tonight, a Sunday, and the roads were pretty deserted. Me, being the procrastinator that I am, was on my last bit of gas and HAD to stop to make it home. I pulled into the nearest gas station and it was closed, but not a big deal as I had my debit card. I scanned the station and saw you pumping gas and immediately felt better as there was someone else with me at the empty and dimly lit station.I got out, glanced around, being aware of my surroundings as my always paranoid mother taught me. We made eye contact and you gave me a comforting smile. I was typing in my pin number and noticed you closing your gas cap and getting into your vehicle. I didn't want you to leave. You were a stranger, you could have been a serial killer, but your smile and your eyes put me at ease. I felt safer with you around. You pulled away and went around the gas station and the minute you were out of sight, I was on alert. I kept checking my surroundings, wishing I hadn't picked the seeimingly slowest pump at this station. He came put of no where-- I was alone and then I wasn't. He wore camo pants and an oversized black hoodie, the hood up and shielding a lot of his face. I gripped my keys tightly in my hand, trying to get them between my fingers just in case. He asked for a ride, calling me \"sugar titties\" and winking. I quickly said, \"sorry, I have somewhere to be\" and wished I had sounded more confident as the words left my mouth. He persisted, yanking on the door handle of my passenger back door. I said \"no!\" again, this time, more forcefully. He kept laughing, like this was the most hilarious game in the world and tried my passenger door.I froze. I'm not proud of myself. I should have jumped into the car and drove off.

I once was at a gas station in broad daylight, early morning rush hour, people all around. A disheveled woman approached me, asking for help, saying she'd been raped. Something seemed off, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Hairs on the back of my neck went up. I was also taught to be paranoid as a kid, so I was looking all around for her accomplice and for back up. I noticed a man at another pump keeping an eye on the situation, which made me feel better, but I was still freaked out. After a few moments, the woman approached somebody else. I got in my car and left, calling the police to let them know about her. As I had time to process the interaction, I realized she likely needed some help for a mental illness, and that's why her story wasn't making sense. I was on alert because I knew something was wrong with her - I don't think she would have harmed me. But at the end of it all, I realized that the whole time I was talking to her and on edge, I had pepper spray in my hand, and never once thought about having it ready to use until I was 5 minutes down the road.You just never know how you'll react.

I had one when I was 19. I was living in Okinawa, married for just 6 months when I found out I was pregnant. I did a Google search and after some intense digging, I found what I believe was a Reddit post of someone who had an abortion at a clinic on the island and she gave a little Information about her experience. The clinic's website was all in Japanese. All I had was a clinic name and GPS. My husband didn't support my decision to abort at the time. Don't worry, it has been 6 years he has come a long way since then. So, I was alone in this entire process. I found the clinic and walked in. When I found someone who spoke English, I had to repeat the word \"abortion\" to the nurse several times in the waiting room. Each time, she repeated the word in Japanese and the women around me would cringe. I had a pelvic exam by a male doctor. He told me it was too early to tell if I was pregnant - come back in 4 weeks. I came back and the same doctor performed an internal ultrasound. I was terrified because I didn't even know that was a thing. He pointed at the screen and made cutesy baby noises. He spoke limited English but kept saying \"twins? twins?\" He printed out an ultrasound picture and told me to keep it. They told me it would me the equivalent of ~$2,000 USD. I came back in another 4 weeks after I had gathered the money. By this time I was much farther along than I wanted to be. I think I was around 15 weeks. All I know is my lower stomach had begun to harden and round out. The day of the procedure I was again greeted in the waiting room with a public announcement of \"A-BORT-ION\" followed by the word in Japanese. I signed some paper work written in Japanese and paid the fee. I was led back into a small room to change into a dressing gown. I was led into another room with a cold steel table/bed thing with stirrups. Several female nurses were in the room. The doctor came into the room and rolled in some kind of machine with a hose attached - I had no idea what this was at the time. They hooked me up to an IV, but then I started having a panic attack. I remember someone stroking my hair and singing right before I fell asleep.I woke up in a room filled with soft floor mats and pillows. I was wearing what I can only describe as a very large and bulky clothe diaper. I had bled through it. There was a Japanese woman next to me, lying a couple feet away. I noticed she was heavily sobbing, then I noticed I was too. We held hands and cried for a little while. I can't really remember how long I was there. They woke me up at some point and told me I was free to go. I got dressed, but i was still bleeding very heavily. I found some gauze-like bandages in the room I got dresses in and used that a temporary sanitary pads. I called my husband to pick me up and waited outside on the sidewalk. I was too ashamed to sit in the waiting room, in case anyone recognized me from earlier that morning. I slept for almost two days afterwards. My husband and I were civil to one another, but we didnt talk about it. He didnt ask questions, good or bad ones. He didn't want to know. I was confused and ashamed. I didn't feel guilty for not wanting a child, but then again I felt guilty because I didn't feel guilty? I've never been through such a complex mixture of emotions. I have not once felt regret for my decision, but I have felt intense sadness. I have relived the moments leading up to and following my abortion many times. I wouldn't wish for another woman to feel the shame or loneliness I felt those few months. I felt like this burden was mine alone and my husband was just a bystander to it all. I felt worse that he had to know about my burden, then I did about carrying it around with me. I became a recluse in our marriage for many years. I stopped wanting sex or intimacy of any kind, and he stopped asking for or expecting it, out of respect for me. I began the healing process when we moved back to the US 2.5 years ago. I found that being around familiar friends and family again helped to me see something in myself again. I told my husband this story for the first time not even a week ago, in full detail. We cried together for the first time in a long time. He was inconsolable. He said he has never thought to really ask me about it because while he is now fully pro-choice and understands my decision, he still thought abortion was something he shouldn't ask about, even to his wife. He apologized for not supporting my decision back then but said he would never forgive himself. We still have some recovery to do in our marriage. I realized, in sharing the full story for the first time, that I probably still need therapy. But I feel more empowered and happy and positive-thinking right now than I have been in a long time.I hope I posted this in the right place.Thanks for reading and letting me share this with you.

Wanted sexual advances can become unwanted sexual advances.  Unwanted sexual advances can turn into wanted sexual advances.  A sexual advance that is actually wanted, could be unwanted in a particular context and an advances that is unwanted could become wanted in a particular context.Rather than working to *stop* unwanted sexual advances, I think we'd be better off education both sexual aggressors and the sexually pursued to better understand how to respond to unwanted sexual advances when they occur.

I wanted to voice my experience with sexual abuse to help other people and show the frequency that sexual assaults/abuse/harrasment take place, but I wasn't able to. I've only told two people about my experience and I am not yet comfortable with the people in my life knowing my story. I don't know if I'll ever be comfortable with everyone in my life knowing, but I still want to tell it because it is a story that needs to be told. So I will tell it to you guys in the hopes that it will help at least one of you that may be going through a similar situation. So if you are sensitive to stories of sexual assault I would advise you to skip my story.Growing up my older brother (well half brother) and I were super close. I also had an older sister closer to my age but she never wanted to hang out with me since I was the stereotypical annoying little sister. But my brother would always hang out with me whenever I wanted. That all changed though when my father passed away. My father's passing caused something to snap in my brother. He became so so so angry. He would punch holes in the walls, he would hit me and my sister, he punched a hole in my bedroom door when I tried to escape him, and he started sexually abusing me. He would make me do things by threatening me with physical violence. He would tell me that if I said anything to my mom or anyone else he would hurt me. It got to the point where his threats of hurting me were more appealing than the things he was making me do, so he started using my sister to threaten me. He would say that he would hurt my sister if I didn't do what he said. So it went on for years. Eventually my brother slipped up and my mother saw him hit me, so she sent him to live with my grandparents when I was around 10 or 11. He ended up passing away in a car accident when I was 14 years old and I probably only saw him twice between the day he moved out until the day of his passing. I refused to go see him during the calling hours because even in death I was still afraid. Loud noises still scared me. People sneaking up on me still scared me. I was afraid of getting close to partners. I would jump if people raised their voices. It affected me for years, and because of that I was ashamed of myself. I was so ashamed that he still had this power over me even when he was dead. After almost a year of being with my current boyfriend I told him about what my brother did to me. And my boyfriend has helped me tremendously. He has helped me find strength that I didn't know I had. While I still feel ashamed every once in awhile, I am doing much better.SO if any of you don't have someone in your life to help you find your strength, let me help you. You are so much stronger than you think you are. Never feel ashamed of what was done to you instead use it as your armor because YOU SURVIVED that. You did not allow it to consume you. You continued on with your life. Even those days when you woke up and couldn't get out of bed because you were depressed or because you just didn't have the strength, you still woke up. You are still here. Always know that you are good enough and you are strong enough and you are a survivor.Anyway, thank for reading my story I appreciate it. #MeToo.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "76ru43", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "#MeToo", "num_comments": 6, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 36, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 164, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/76ru43/metoo/", "submission_time": "Mon Oct 16 20:55:58 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Your story is so heartbreaking to read, but I'm glad you feel safe enough to confide in your boyfriend.

A lot of my female friends have posted, and it just sucks.  I want to give a proactive perspective and suggestions for future culture:1) As mothers (and fathers), don't let the first exposure to male/female interaction be that of Middle School boys. Just don't. Proactively let your seemingly angelic young boy know what your expectations are, and talk not just about sex, but about assault and consent as well.  Create a culture in your own home first.  - I got scolded as a VERY young kid about how not to hurt girls (it was very innocuous interaction, looking back, but the lesson stuck).    - If I didn't have that experience, my first experience would have been seeing jerky Middle School boys snap the bras of Middle School girls.  Who knows if I would have been enticed to do the same, but by knowing that my parents would not tolerate girls being hurt, I was pretty sure that applied to snapping bras as well. Don't let your boys become those jerks that young.  In later years, it could translate into far worse behavior.2) Apply actual positive peer pressure.  Peer pressure works for adults as well.  Share a posting like this and let peers know that it should be a community effort that they should be discussing with their own kids.  Make it a cultural compulsory action to take.3) The \"Me Too\" offers the scope of a problem.  Let it also serve as a point of advocacy.  Advocate for not just sexual education, but sexual harassment / abuse education.I'm sure this just touches the surface of what should be done.HOWEVER, please share your own thoughts / suggestions for proactive steps to take to change the culture.

I'm only 19 and at the moment I live with my mom until I get an apartment. Note: I'm danish and a university student so it's more than normal to move at this time in my life. My mom and dad are going through a divorce after 25 years of trying to make it work. This leave all the house work to my mom, sister and me. I'm a full time student with a part time job on the side, while trying to maintain a social life- I'm not much home. My mom is lonely and depressed after the divorce but everything I do is wrong. Never help with house work, even when I do the dishes when I get home at 9. The dogs are her responsibility, even when I feed them, walk them at the evening and the afternoon if I'm home early. And a lot of other tings. Everything I do is never good enough or just straight up wrong. I can't talk to her because she makes herself the victim and me the one at fault. Today I promised to help her at Sunday and I asked what date it was. She said the date and asked why. I told her it was because my boss asked if I could come to work. After that she just assumed I'd go to work instead of helping her. I called her out and said it was not fair for yelling and be mad at me for something she assumed. She then proceeded to tell me all the thing I do wrong all the time and how it makes her feel bad and makes her want to kill herself. This is not a place I want to stay at but I can't take the chance and move in with my dad, because she has a history of suicide attempts and I don't want to take the risk. I hope some of you might have some advice on what I can do because I'm so lost at the moment. TL;DR; I'm doing my best at helping my mom through a divorce but everything I say and do is wrong.

Nothing out of the ordinary since that was the normal recommendation and I'm not getting younger so I didn't think to much about it. As far as I was aware, my family had no history of cancer of any sort so it was just a precautionary step. Fast forward to this fall and I'm living life as usual. One morning about 2 weeks ago I found a lump in my breast. I wasn't panicked because it was small and I remembered from health class many moons ago that breast tissue can be fiberous and change so I watched it for a couple of days. I called my doctor and went in to have them check it out on the third day since I hadn't felt any changes. They agreed it existed and sent me off to get a mammogram. Maybe my social circles just don't talk about women's health enough or they haven't had the best of experiences. The few things I've heard about mammograms in the past were that they squish your boobs flat and it hurts. My experience was very pretty simple. The technicians and nurses were friendly and caring. The process was painless although some of the positioning was awkward. No worse than any other imaging process, I suppose. In my case, it was followed up by an ultrasound scan as well. Unfortunately, they found a suspicious mass that required a biopsy.  Now I was scared. A couple of days later, they performed a core needle biopsy guided by an ultrasound. The area was numbed and the samples were taken without pain, only the feeling of pressure. And then I was a bit sore for a few days. Two days later I got a phone call with the results and appointments set up with an oncologist and a surgeon. After letting my family know what was happening, I started to get more information from relatives about estranged aunts and other relatives who've had breast cancer or other types of cancer. I was floored to find out that no one thought to talk about it before now. I can't help but feel like I might have been a bit more prepared to deal with things if I had know of my family's history, though rationally, I don't think anything could have prepared me. I also can't imagine how far progressed the cancer would be if I had waited until a scheduled mammogram. I have a long road of emotional and physical challenges ahead of me but I will make it through.Don't let October be you're only reminder to check yourself. You are the only one familiar enough with yourself to know when something isn't normal. And for the sake of other women, start talking!

I masturbate frequently, but only with clit stimulation. I use pads; but I do have the ability of using tampons. I have to lay on the ground in a very weird angle with a mirror pointed towards me, and I maybe go through 2-3 trying, but I can get one in comfortably after a while if I have to. So, I don't have much up my vagina very often- and this is where my problem starts. I'm currently laying in my bed crying because I can't have sex. I just recently started seeing a guy I'm very very comfortable with, and we've decided that me losing my virginity to him is a good, comfortable choice for both parties. When we hung out last week, I gave him a short bj and he ate me out for a while, and then he tried going in- but he didn't even get the tip in and it hurt like crazy. We laid down and talked for a little while about it, and tried again, but it was still just as painful. I felt plugged up- and the pressure was so immense that even my clit was hurting. I asked him to stop and told him we wouldn't be having sex tonight, and so we went to bed. When I got home the next morning I desperately wanted to figure things out. I figured it's just because I've never really fingered myself or done anything of that sort before- so I masturbated (like normal, just my clit) until I came so I know I would be fully lubricated. I started with my fingers and I got two in comfortably, but... he's very well endowed, to say the least, so I knew I needed something bigger. I didn't have a spare cucumber laying around (lmao) so I took the end of my hairbrush and started trying. (btw during all of this I was laying on my back, kinda like a missionary position- which is how I tried losing my virginity earlier on). It took a little while, but after getting VERY well lubricated and going VERY slow, I got the entire handle of the hairbrush inside of me- yay! I didn't \"masturbate\" with it- in fact, I was so scared of staining my sheets with the blood from stretching my hymen (which ended up being nothing, lmao) that I left it in for a minute or two and immediately took it out and went to shower. But, I got it in! It was only mildly painful- which was to expect because before I had literally only gotten a finger inside. Fast forward to today, I have a date with the guy mentioned above. I still very much want to have sex with him- and he wants to have sex with me- but I'm afraid this penetration thing won't workout for us. I just tried the exact same routine as mentioned above- masturbate until I orgasm and get very wet, then try with fingers, and then the hairbrush- but I couldn't even get a finger in. I feel a ton of pressure all around and I really don't feel like my vagina is expanding or moving- I feel like the hairbrush is pushing and moving my vagina into whatever place I put it. I got it about half an inch in before I started crying and gave up. I feel very stupid and almost immature, in a way, because I can't even finger myself. The relationship I have with this guy is very important to me- but we've both expressed that it's not going to be anything more than fuck buddies. Still, I want to have sex with him, and I trust him and I'm comfortable with him. But I feel like I'm hyping him up and letting him down. I feel fucking terrible, and I feel like this won't ever get better.

I have started to feel a little hopeless myself. It's a very strange feeling when your vagina won't work like you've been told it would. It's curious and then it's frustrating and then it's depressing. But I can tell you one thing - you CAN have plenty of positive, enjoyable, and beautiful sexual experiences in your life that do not involve penetration. Most of mine with my husband have been oral and it's been amazing. It's funny how you learn to perfect something when it's one of the only options left for you! One more thing - I would consider NOT attempting sexual intercourse until you see a healthcare professional. You may inadvertently connect sex with negative experiences. This happened to me and I lost all desire to have sex - any kind of sex, for a long time. Not saying this is guaranteed to happen, but sex should always been positive and wonderful and mutually enjoyable.

I know plenty of families who have gone through this, but now-a-days most farms get around the estate tax with a trust.  It's not a big problem, but it's not a lie.  It's not a valid reason for keeping the estate tax, but again, it is true.Double taxing LLCs and C-Corps is a real thing, too.  Yes, it includes Doctors and other professionals, but it also hit your local landscaper or any other licensed professional.

Well that's just absurd.  All three are between 5-10% ROA.  Slightly higher than a typical retailer like Macy's or Walmart.Repatriating will create some jobs, but that's not the point of repatriation.  It's to get the tax revenues.  This is just a big strawman.  Krugman was pro-repatriation before Trump won.Also, there is a tax cut for the rich, but not ONLY the rich.

This is obvious.The argument should be that they don't NEED a tax cut, not that they are the only ones getting it.  Of course 80% of the tax cut will go to the people making 80% of the money all things equal.  That's not an argument.The reason middle class people want the tax cuts is because their 3-4% increase in take home pay is real and substantial to them.

Someone decently tech-savvy could pull off at least the trivial versions, and using scripts means it is already available in most hacking circles. However, the attack does require proximity to the target. Meaning the attacking device needs to be within WiFi range of your devices to affect you.How can I protect myself? The only real protection here is to turn off WiFi until a patch is released for your device. That may be a few weeks out, but it is coming.

This is HUGE news! (TL;DR at bottom for those who just want the skinny.) There are two kinds of gravitational wave signal that LIGO can detect- colliding black holes (of which four such events have been found so far), and harder but a neutron star- neutron star (NS-NS) collision is also possible.  And these are harder to detect, but the signal you get has a lot more going for it: first, no one knows for sure if black hole- black hole mergers even *have* any light they give off, but second the amount of sky you get from these LIGO signals if you want to do follow up is insane- you will literally get a map covering about half the sky and be told to go look.  As you can imagine, that's not super useful.NS-NS mergers, though, are different.  First, we *did* expect them to give off electromagnetic radiation in some form- for example, there is a class of gamma ray burst (GRB), [called short GRBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst#Short_gamma-ray_bursts), which make up about 30% of all GRBs we detect but no one has said where they come from for sure but NS-NS mergers were the leading theory.  It's been a mystery for decades though.  Second, the map you get is *way* better on the sky- more like 30 square degrees (might not be perfectly remembering that number), which is still a lot of sky but nowhere near as bad as half of it if you want to find a counterpart.So, in August, LIGO detected a gravitational wave from a NS-NS merger, and the gamma-ray telescope Fermi detected a GRB at the *exact* same time from that direction of sky.  Moreover, it was astronomically pretty close to us- I don't remember how exactly you get distance from gravitational waves, but the point is you can and you could then make up a list of galaxies within that patch of sky within that distance for a short follow-up list.  So this was *way* easier to track down, and everyone in August was laughing in astronomy because this was the worst kept secret of all time- all the big space telescopes have public logs, for example, when they do a \"target of opportunity\" it is public record.  But what was found exactly was still a secret until today, and the answer is multiple telescopes picked up this signal in multiple bands, which is a kind of signal we've never seen before but some folks have literally spent *decades* looking for.  So not only do we have the first successful follow up from a gravitational wave detector, we have solved the mystery of where GRBs come from AND witnessed a NS-NS merger for the first time ever!On a final note, I should say that the first astronomer to discover the signal from this merger, in optical, is a colleague of mine who doesn't even normally focus on this stuff, but got lucky for doing follow up in the right place at the right time and thus gets the eternal fame and fortune.  She is an awesome astronomer, plus all around good person, and it is always so lovely to see cool people succeed! :)We are at the dawn of something new!  This is an exciting place to be!TL;DR- Not only did they discover the first ever neutron star-neutron star merger, they also did the first ever follow up in light to detect it there, *and* solved an enduring mystery lasting decades on where 30% of all gamma ray bursts come from.

This is HUGE news! (TL;DR at bottom for those who just want the skinny.) There are two kinds of gravitational wave signal that LIGO can detect- colliding black holes (of which four such events have been found so far), and harder but a neutron star- neutron star (NS-NS) collision is also possible.  And these are harder to detect, but the signal you get has a lot more going for it: first, no one knows for sure if black hole- black hole mergers even *have* any light they give off, but second the amount of sky you get from these LIGO signals if you want to do follow up is insane- you will literally get a map covering about half the sky and be told to go look.  As you can imagine, that's not super useful.NS-NS mergers, though, are different.  First, we *did* expect them to give off electromagnetic radiation in some form- for example, there is a class of gamma ray burst (GRB), [called short GRBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst#Short_gamma-ray_bursts), which make up about 30% of all GRBs we detect but no one has said where they come from for sure but NS-NS mergers were the leading theory.  It's been a mystery for decades though.  Second, the map you get is *way* better on the sky- more like 30 square degrees (might not be perfectly remembering that number), which is still a lot of sky but nowhere near as bad as half of it if you want to find a counterpart.So, in August, LIGO detected a gravitational wave from a NS-NS merger, and the gamma-ray telescope Fermi detected a GRB at the *exact* same time from that direction of sky.  Moreover, it was astronomically pretty close to us- I don't remember how exactly you get distance from gravitational waves, but the point is you can and you could then make up a list of galaxies within that patch of sky within that distance for a short follow-up list.  So this was *way* easier to track down, and everyone in August was laughing in astronomy because this was the worst kept secret of all time- all the big space telescopes have public logs, for example, when they do a \"target of opportunity\" it is public record.  But what was found exactly was still a secret until today, and the answer is multiple telescopes picked up this signal in multiple bands, which is a kind of signal we've never seen before but some folks have literally spent *decades* looking for.  So not only do we have the first successful follow up from a gravitational wave detector, we have solved the mystery of where GRBs come from AND witnessed a NS-NS merger for the first time ever!On a final note, I should say that the first astronomer to discover the signal from this merger, in optical, is a colleague of mine who doesn't even normally focus on this stuff, but got lucky for doing follow up in the right place at the right time and thus gets the eternal fame and fortune.  She is an awesome astronomer, plus all around good person, and it is always so lovely to see cool people succeed! :)We are at the dawn of something new!  This is an exciting place to be!TL;DR- Not only did they discover the first ever neutron star-neutron star merger, they also did the first ever follow up in light to detect it there, *and* solved an enduring mystery lasting decades on where 30% of all gamma ray bursts come from.

Saying things like \u201cwhat do they expect him to do?\u201d or it\u2019s impossible to fix Puerto Rico and provide for them quickly seeing as they are on an island.Well here\u2019s the thing people. Houston Texas was devastated right? So was Florida. Houston is home to about 2.5 million people.  New Orleans had what 1 million or so? How were those disasters handled? How many people were displaced in Florida how many lost everything? These places got help. Even in New Orleans with the terrible response big things were done when it became the disaster that it became. New Orleans is STILL recovering from the devastation. Many people just left the city after losing everything. However, in all of these cases the military and fema mobilized to provide the essentials. Drinking water and evacuation of necessary. What do people expect from Trump? Leadership. A leader would identify the problem weigh the potential solutions and act. Do whatever it took to save people. Get people off the island, get shelters in place, get people the water they need. Basically do what they did for every other American city that has been affected by a disaster. This isn\u2019t about rebuilding the island it\u2019s about getting people in danger out or provide what they need.The federal government is funded for just such occasions. If money is an issue then he goes to congress and gets emergency funding. It\u2019s his responsibility to also be as frugal as possible in spending taxpayers hard earned money. This storm was not a surprise. When the warning that Texas was going to be hot hard provisions were staged and plans were in place to respond effectively. Same in Florida. The main highways leading to Florida were shut down and made to go only in one direction. Helicopters from the navy, the floating hospital that belongs to the government, aircraft carriers. Military equipment designed to get around areas with no or little infrastructure could have been in place ahead of time. If there weren\u2019t enough people to handle the job then you pull people in from other departments to assist. Anyone within government with the skills to help. ALL OF THIS is within the power of the president to do. So what has he done to help? Apart from declaring Puerto Rico a disaster zone he has disparaged the Island and it\u2019s inhabitants. Instead of encouraging them and showing personal interest in them he did the bare minimum. He was on the Island for a mere 3 hours. While people were without power he played golf. Understandably trump can the there on the ground fixing power lines but at the very least he and his administration should be giving an effective play by play so people in Puerto Rico and in the US know where we are and how we can help. He hasn\u2019t done so. Instead he has complained and insulted the people who were begging for help and accusing them of complaining for political gain. Saying a good or \u201ctremendous\u201d job is being done doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s actually happening.Are 3 simultaneous disasters a huge problem? Yes. But even with that this presidents actions have been minimal. The fact is, he is there when it\u2019s for good publicity and gone when things go wrong. He isn\u2019t addressing the situation he isn\u2019t explaining anything he simply says we are doing a great job. There is no doubt that the people at fema and the aid groups are doing what they can. The sense of urgency that existed for Texas and Florida simply isn\u2019t there. And that starts from the top. In short what do people expect from trump? To be the freaking president. And if he isn\u2019t prepared to do it then get out of the way for someone better.
