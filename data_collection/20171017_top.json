I was invited out to a college party by some friends. (I'll mention that they're all under 21 and I'm 23, so there's a bit of a maturity difference.)  I've had my fair share of college parties so I typically know what goes down.  Upon arriving, two of my buds start slamming trash beer to catch up with all the guys who are trying to establish dominance. One of them, my closest friend, who we'll call Hal, gets super wasted. While they're  busy getting slammed, I proceed to grab a beer and drink in moderation off to the side. As I'm being entertained by all the fuckery, a group of girls come over to me and introduce themselves (I'm assuming they could sense a maturity difference)  As soon as I'm surrounded by these girls, all the guys take notice, then the friends who I came with magically make their way towards me. They then introduced themselves to the girls. One girl in particular had an eye on me from the get go. She asks if I have an Instagram and tells me to add her. At the moment I couldn't because I didn't have any service in the room. So she GRABS my phone and proceeds to run out to the balcony and goes, \"This is the only place that gets service\". Of course. Now I'm following this chick out to the balcony to make sure she doesn't do anything crazy with my phone. We end up being the only two out there, so we chat, she turns out to be pretty cool. We get into a deep conversation and what not. I then have to take a piss, so I leave her with my phone and tell her I'll be back. BIG MISTAKE. So Hal to me is that one good friend who always thinks I'm selling myself short. He saw me follow the chick and starts drunk texting my phone. Cool, he's looking out for me. Except while he's texting my phone I'm taking a piss, and who has my phone? Drunk chick.  I walk back to the balcony to find chick missing. Fuck.  I scramble back inside to find her surrounded by those girls gasping to themselves. I get the meanest look I've ever had in my life.  She then promptly walks up to me, shows me the texts, and shoves my phone into my chest. Ouch. Now this is the first time I'm seeing the texts. From Hal: dude.. wtf are you doing She's not even hot...Dude she's fucking nasty. Don't do it. Great, I'm trying to get laid and Hal just cockblocked me via text. (She was actually decent looking)She storms off back to the balcony and of course I try to explain the situation. After her sitting in silence for a few minutes I ask' \"well how do you feel about those?\" She responds in a rabid manner, \" I DONT KNOW, what do you think about them!?\".  Fuck . I'm trying to think of ways to salvage my chances of getting laid.I don't know where this came from but in the most rapid way I blurt out, \"well I wouldn't be hanging out with you if I didn't think you were cute\".  It's not even smooth. Not one bit.5 minutes later she's on top of me, in her bed. tl;dr: Drunk friend texts my phone to stop me from hooking up with a chick, chick has my phone and receives all the degrading messages about her.

First time was freshman year, a girl and I had been making eyes at each other through 8th grade and at the start of highschool we were both single so we got to getting while it was good. I had no idea my buddy guy (let's call him P) was making moves already, but if I did I don't think it would have stopped me. Freshman relationship did what freshman relationships do, and sputtered out after a year or so. It was really hard on me, I had grown very attached to her. Line went silent between us for two years until in senior year we met up again, funnily enough because I was looking for P to hang out. I remember there was ice in my spine and my legs were shaking like I knew I was in for another trip on Mr. Toad's wild ride when I opened the door to a coffee joint he saud to meet at and I saw her sitting there. They were just hanging out and talking, and I suspected that he was trying to put the moves on her. Maybe he figured that the time and separation were enough to cool my blood, but it still ran hot when I even heard her name. Cold, instinct-driven me immediately took the reigns, as I knew this would take some doing.It was like fate. We hit it off immediately, both of us equal parts nervous and excited. The year we spent together was the happiest I've ever been in my life, and I'm ashamed because I knew it hurt P to do that. Granted, he was never anything but a good sport but he had pined after her for 4 years at this point. It can't have been fun seeing us all year connected at the hip. We were a real power couple, we even made prom king and queen that year. I knew it hurt P but I was too happy to care. Now its been years, another period of radio silence between me and her, but P and I remain great friends. In fact, we just went to Cal Jam together. We talked it out, and he forgave me out of the goodness of his heart and the fact that this girl really fucked both of us over emotionally.  I still think about her sometimes, even though now the want that I feel is tinged with guilt. Tl;dr: I swept in on a girl one of my best friends was making moves on twice over the course of highschool, which effectively kept him single the whole 4 years. The real shame of it lies in the fact that I knew what it would be like for my friend and I did it anyway, and would do it again.

Back in 5th grade, one night while I was getting ready for bed, I started to get some pain in my chest. I went out to the living room and just tried to relax, but it was really nagging at me and starting to get stronger. Naturally, my mom came out to complain that I wasn't in bed yet, so I told her that something wasn't right. She went to conference with my dad about what they should do. At first, my dad didn't want to take me to the emergency room, but that question was answered when I started screaming. My parents rushed me to the car and blew every red light in NYC to get me to the emergency room. At this point I was writing in pain and screaming at five second intervals, I couldn't tell them or the triage doctors anything but my chest hurt. I was rushed to the front of the line and into an x-ray that didn't show anything. My vitals were fine, and I had no internal bleeding. At one point I had five doctors on my case, all of them without answers. They gave me a total of three doses of morphine  to stop the screaming. Four hours later my pain was gone and I was allowed to go home. It was three days later before my general practitioner figured out what had been wrong. He spotted a small dot on the x-ray that had been taken that night, on my lung just above my bronchial tube. Turns out that my bronchial tubes had grown as though I was a normal sized, stockier kid, and my lungs had grown long and thin like my body. My left bronchial tube punctured my lung and air started to leak between the lung and this sort of protective sac that surrounds it. This leak slowly tore the lining from my lung, like having skin being slowly torn off. Worse, it happened right beneath a \"non-localized\" nerve cluster, so not only was the pain amplified, I felt it across my entire chest.TLDR; Bronchial tube punctured my lung, air leak started tearing apart my lung right under a nerve cluster, needed 3 shots of morphine to stop screaming.Edit: Spelling", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2362, "stickied": false, "score": 727, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 05:14:51 2017", "ups": 727}, {"body": "Passing kidney stones.

Because of my depression I had lost a lot of friends and no one wanted to come over to stay with me. I went on world of warcraft and was venting about it to some guild mates and my good WoW friend. My wow friend was 24 at the time and he offered to come stay with me if i was to scared to be alone.

One night we met at a bar around happy hour to run through flashcards and then some friends were supposed to meet us, but never did. I ended up giving him a ride home around 9:30. He invited me in to have a beer and check out his progress on his thesis work (we were art students, so it was a physical piece in his room).

He kept gently pulling me towards the bed saying things to try to convince me to stay. I was not having it, and once I really put my foot down and said fuck you I'm leaving he grabbed me aggressively and threw me on the bed.

I ended up failing all three classes we had together and not getting my degree. The happy ending is that I reached out to the head of my program a few years later and told her everything. She worked with my department chair to get my Fs turned into medical withdrawls and waived the course requirement for the one credit I was missing, so I got my degree!

The idea was to see how many people would ignore the request and just go draw on him anyways, that was the way it started anyways.  He was a psych major and was studying something that was pertinent to this...Pretty basic - Tons of dudes would go in there with markers, empty cans, etc, build forts on him as he pretended to snore.  Draw on his face, fart on his face, etc, stick balls on his forehead and snap pics (Instant Polaroids btw - this is way before cell phone cams).But then, it got weird, we actually cancelled the project because so many girls turned out to be rapists.After most people would pass out, my buddy would get lone, and sometimes, 2 or 3 drunk girls coming into his room, they'd always do the same thing:  Walk around the room being really quiet and sneaky, then when they realized he was snoring, start being extra loud and falling all around, my guess was to see HOW asleep he really was, see if they could wake him up to gauge how drunk he was.  Then they'd say something gross, like all of them did this, \"Time for mama to get some!\" or \"Don't worry, I'll do the work stud!\"(that one stuck with me) even one girl who started doing what we now call twerking on him singing \"Suckin that Di&k, ya suckin that Di&k!\" over and over.  Almost all of them were rubbing his crotch or butt while doing these things, and all of them were watching his face while doing so.As soon as they'd try to get his pants off, or go any further than rubbing, he would bolt up and scream \"Get off me!\" as loud as he could, they would bolt and half the time hit the wall on the way out, we got all of this on camera.He did this for like 6 months before we realized that even the good girls were perverts, like, we had girls we would NEVER imagine being rapey coming up there if they noticed everyone else was passed out, literally, valedictorians from their HS's were trying to rape my buddy.One time he actually did fall asleep and a girl whipped his dick out and was singing into it like a microphone when he came to.I basically learned that year that most women are just as rapey as men but they tend to not get caught because they are smarter about their approach.We also did a chris hansen intervention with several of them, way before it was a show, girls we knew, and thought we respected, girls with 4.3 GPA's that went on to be bio chemists and surgeons.They said stuff like \"Girls have hormones too!\" and \"I thought he was inviting me up there by asking me to leave him alone!\" etc...When we would point out that it was rapey, they would cry and say \"I know, I'm fked up, I'm sorry.\"Two of them left Uni, and several begged us not to tell, implying that this was not their first rodeo.Changed my whole perspective on sexual assault, trust me ladies and gents, it's not just the boys, the girls are just as bad, they just don't get caught because they choose guys that are drunk and out cold snoring apparently.  Forgot about reverse rapist girl - she was a TA in a chemistry class I had, she came in, saw he was passed out drunk, laid next to him, started pretend snoring with her eyes open, and would move his body parts onto hers, then lay still and snore, see if he noticed, then move him some more, like, she had him basically on top of her, with one hand between her legs, and one hand on her bared breast, and she started licking his throat, which prompted him to scream \"GET OFF OF ME!\" which was hilarious, because he was on top, didn't stop her from horse kicking him off of her and sprinting headlong into a hallway banister.  She was the first girl we intervened on and she packed up and left that day, never heard from her again, word was she x-ferred to Davis.  But she was an interesting one, she basically set the scene up in a way that it LOOKED to a 3rd party that they both were passed out drunk, so even if someone caught her raping him, she could say \"I was on bottom, how could I have raped him?\" and she would have probably won that argument had it not been for 8MM taping technologies haha!Since I know people will ask, we destroyed all the tapes, and dropped the project.  We both kinda stopped going to parties and we didn't want to ruin anyone's lives, plus, it was sooo many women that half the school would have been arrested for attempted rape and neither of us wanted to be at the heart of that scandal.And these women, turned out fine btw, I know several of them still, we never bring up the attempted rapes, but ya, it happened, and most of them now know that we knew.

He was 8 years my senior but I didn't care, no one had ever paid me any attention so I was happy. I should mention here that he was married. I have no excuse for what happened between us and I still feel horrible about it, but it is what it is. Anyway, we continued with just sex for a few months before I tried to break it off. I felt super guilty for lying to his wife and my family about our relationship so I tried to leave. He wasn't having it. He quilted me into staying, sayi g he would rather die than be without me and he said he'd almost bought weed the night I told him I was leaving. At the time, weed had a really big stigma around it for me, and I was afraid of what it would do to him (hindsight says ha!). I stayed.A few months later, I'd graduated high school and could spend a lot of time with him. I'd go over and we'd have sex and he would berate me and pinch me, leaving bruises on my legs and arms. When his wife would come home, we'd all get along like nothing was happening, but it would go on when she went to bed. He pressured me into sex acts I wasn't comfortable with and he'd hurt me physically. The physical abuse never got above the bruises, but he'd do it whenever he was feeling like I wasn't paying enough attention to him or if he didn't like what I was doing. The year after I graduated, his wife got pregnant. Because I was so close to them, I was designated their baby's hororary aunt. I stuck around because I'd grown to love his wife as a really good friend and I was genuinely excited for their baby. I both naively and terrifingly thought that when the baby came, I'd be free, but also forgotten. Throughout the pregnancy, he continued to pressure me into things. I remember one day, he wanted to give me oral, but I wasn't feeling it. I told him explicitly that I didn't want it, he shot back \"of course you do, you always do\" and was angry when I repeatedly said that I didn't. He stopped talking to me for a little bit and I was so afraid because I didn't want to lose him. I eventually stopped saying I didn't want sexual things from him because it was easier to go along with it than fight with him. Their baby came and I was put on the back burner. I was initially thankful, but after his wife went back to work, I was over there a lot, helping out with the baby and still being his sex toy. As their baby grew, I drifted from him. All my time was spent with their child, feeding and playing and teaching. I didn't knownis love someone so much. The following spring, my grandpa died. His was the first big death in my life and it destroyed me. My family and I went to the state he'd lived in that summer and spent 5 weeks there. While there, my abuser/boyfriend called me non-stop and refused to really let me spend time with my family. He knew that it was the first time I'd seen them in about 4 years, but he didn't care. One of the days he wouldn't let me off the phone, I'd texted him, \"did you call me so much because you miss me? ;)\" He never responded. When I came back home, apparently I'd started treating him badly. I'd known I'd grown distant and that had probably rubbed off but my behavior handy changed. When he confronted me, I made something up about how much it hurt when mybgrandpa died and I didn't want to hurt anyone like that if I'd died. I'm not sure if he believed me or not. The relationship was rocky from then on. I had stopped going over so much, and he'd stopped asking for sex as much. Instead of being his sex toy, I'd turned into his babysitter. I'd watch his kid while he slept or played games with no pay. Because I was Honorary Auntie, and because I love that kid more than anything, I didn't mind, but it still would have been nice for some kind of compensation. After three years since losing my virginity to him, I'd finally had enough when he got very angry with me for saying our relationship wasn't fair. I told him I couldn't do it anymore. I told him I loved him and his kid and his wife, but it wasn't fair to any of us or to any of our families what we were doing. I tried again to cut it off. Again, he wouldn't let me leave. It continued on, worse than before, for another six months before I stopped going over at all unless his wife or other friends were there. Id leave when she went to bed or our friends left. I think he finally got the hint because he let me leave. After three and a half years, I was finally free. Over a year later, I'm still Honorary Auntie, but living in a different city and I have a totally new group of friends. I've entered into a new relationship and I'm starting to be happy again. I've learned that no matter how much you love someone and no matter much that person claims to love you, it's not enough. I've learned that having secret relationships is something I never want again. I've learned that what I did, while wrong and absolutely disgusting, is something that I tried so hard to be rid of for so long. I know that it's not all his fault, I made some big mistakes, too. And I still have a lot to learn. My new relationship has reawakened those feelings of \"don't do anything wrong and he won't leave.\" It's triggered my anxiety over relationships and sex.

Meanwhile, the two largest cities - Kansas City and Saint Louis - are on opposite sides of the state. On top of that, a chunk of Kansas City is technically part of Kansas, and a chunk of Saint Louis is across the river in Illinois. We'd likely find ourselves immediately in a border conflict with Kansas for control of K.C. We'd probably let IL have East Saint Louis since the Mississippi River is a handy dividing line, and most of the west part of Saint Louis hates the East anyway. Plus, even with the corruption and bankruptcy, we couldn't take IL. Once the border dispute with Kansas was settled - I don't imagine either side would gain or loose much and the State Line in KC would instead become a DMZ between the two nations - we'd actually be in a semi-decent spot. We have enough farm land and industry to support ourselves, and the Mississippi River would give us easy access to trade to the north and south while the Missouri river lets us resume our \"Gateway to the West\" status. Other states wouldn't be much of a problem for us. We have plenty of states between us and the major powers on the continent - New York, California, Canada, Mexico and Texas wouldn't be close enough to pose a direct threat and wouldn't have reason to, and since we're in the heart of the country overseas powers wouldn't gain much from messing with our internal affairs. Eventually the conflict between the liberal cities and rural farming communities would either blow over due to outside pressure and our ongoing uneasy peace with Kansas, or it would blow up into a second civil war. The only real problem would be Illinois, which would be descending into corruption and bankruptcy as mentioned earlier in this thread. Once their initial government inevitably collapses, we'll have to monitor closely whatever arises from that - because if Illinois becomes expansionist, we'd be their first target. (At least, Saint Louis would be, since if they controlled both part of the city they'd be able to control trade along the Mississippi and the Missouri.) On the other hand, a peaceful Illinois would be a very important ally and probably critical for stability after the 5-10 year mark.

Ultimately i think the fact that we both had relationships with people we were friends with before made us decide like this. He lost his gf and a very good friend because she cheated on him (they dont talk anymore). I lost my Bf and a very good friend because i was a mental wrack at that point (we dont talk anymore).We both didnt want to risk losing each other for some sex or maybe more which might not even work out because we have been through similar negative experiences.

This person was my dad who in all ways and forms was the best person I have ever met. Before you say I have confirmation bias and well as normal bias listen to these facts:  Back in the mid 1900s he was 2nd place in fencing as well as 1st place in writing. He was so impressive he got an interview that was broadcast on all Shanghai TV.  After getting back from the communes of the communist revolution (in which he became the representative and leader of his commune) he immediately decided he wanted to go to college, so he independent studied for about a year and got accepted into an esteemed college in Japan.  He then applied for Japanese citizenship and opened his own massage parlor, which since had become a small chain.  This chain then got an entire newspaper article on it and he attracted a few famous sumo who loved my dad because he was the only massager athletic enough to actually stretch their heavy limbs.   And before you say he was probably a massive selfish asshole listen to this.  He then sold the massage parlors to help fund his younger sister's (or my aunt's) newly formed swim club. Unfortunately there was no way to move that mass of money without it looking suspicious. So did my dad give up?  **No.**  He applied for a Canadian citizenship, which through some astronomical luck got accepted, just to donate money to my aunt.  He then decided he wanted to move to America, so he moved back to Japan, met my mother, and moved to America after financially and mentally supporting my mom.  And his achievements aren't the best part about him. Everywhere he went he exhaled charisma and made so many friends, that I got to swim with the Chinese Junior Olympic Team and the Special Olympics team for 3 summers completely free.  However he was more or less alcoholic and this affected his sleep patterns alot through his adulthood.  One day, however, he got stomach ulcers, and his medication was incompatible with alcohol. My dad, through pure force of will, quit cold turkey braving through withdrawal just so he could take his ulcer medication. After that he never touched alcohol again except for recreation at parties.  He wasn't some sort of inhuman robot however. He loved me and my mom with all the love a human could bear to give and would gladly die for us at any time.  Along with these things my dad was also incredibly good at sports and had a fit strong body even up to his 70s. At age 30 he became a volleyball coach literally because he missed playing sports.  His voice was extremely loud when he yelled with all his might and once at a swim meet he got excited enough to yell at me at full volume and the entire pool became quiet and looked at him for about a second before resuming volume.  ~~He never broke any bones in his entire life.~~ (NVM he dislocated his toe once).  While it would be safe to assume he would be incredibly misogynistic and close minded with his will and age, My dad was one of the most open-minded and just generally accepting individual I had ever seen at his age.  In fact to take care of me when my mother was in college he quit his job. Then when my mother had finished getting her law degree he stayed at home while she worked.  He was incredibly peace loving and just wanted all life to get along.  One time him  and me got hit by a motorcycle and he was about to get angry but seeing how scared the lady who hit us was just gently scolded her and let her go with no repercussions as he felt no lasting injuries had been done.  He was always very accepting of my failures and accidents even when he couldn't understand why I was unable to do something that was so simple to him.  He was very accepting of my limitations but would sometimes get frustrated that I couldn't just put my mind to something and fix it through pure force of will like he did.  Once to prove a point, my dad aspired to retrain to be able to touch his toes again (Which he had been unable to do for upwards of 20 years then) to prove that anyone could train and become better.  If he was the value of gold as a person than I was the value of iron at best. And he wasn't some sort of genetic fluke in my family line either.   *(My brother finished high school in 3 years and was invited to become co-owner of a company in Toronto right off the get-go.*)  *(My cousin is going to Harvard because of her amazing hockey skills.)*  I sometimes feel discouraged because I lack any of his great attributes and I am completely ordinary but I then feel better because I know he is proud of me no matter my flukes.  My dad was an amazing person in general and whenever I tell his story to someone he always seems too good to be true.

It is extremely disconcerting, as I'm typing this it's happened twice...and every time I go somewhere else I always return exhausted, like I just ran a marathon.Reminds me of the holographic theory, does anything even exist when we are not observing it? If a tree falls in the forrest and there's no one there to hear it does it make a sound? What if there is no tree, or forrest for that matter, when no one is there to see it.\u00a0What is real, what isn't. I find myself more and more questioning the events of my life. Are all my memories real? Did all of those things, good and bad that shaped my life really happen? Do I have pleasant memories of someone who never existed....During the times when my insomnia was at it's worst and going a week without sleep was commonplace, I would regularly lose days, completely wiped from my memory. Likewise on my pill, cocaine and whiskey fueled benders that dominated my youth, there are so many big chunks of time unaccounted for. Did my mind fill in those gaps with people and places that never were?The longer I spend alone, the more doubt creeps in. The more I feel that maybe I truly am alone. As the famous poem says, everything I see or seem is but a dream within a dream..which I may or may not have come up with depending on whether or not Edgar Allan Poe ever existed at all.Ironically the only thing that keeps me grounded in this particular reality is pain, which I don't understand why if I created this world I would inflict on my body and psyche so much pain.\u00a0Maybe knowing nothing is real contributed to my reckless behavior all my life, allowing me to do all the things I did without fear of retribution.\u00a0In my teens transporting literal tons of illicit drugs across multiple state lines, sometimes driving it myself and sometimes as a follow car ready to collide with any police vehicle who thought to stop the loaded car, as I did in Louisiana. And not only did the load get through safe but I got off with only a citation. Was that due to my masterful silver tongue? Was it pure luck? Or was it because I willed it so.\u00a0I've been shot at more times than I can count, been tortured with cigars and hung upside down having mineral water poured down my nose with a towel over my face. I've been arrested by swat teams on 3 separate occasions and detained by the DEA. I've lost more money and property than most people will make in their entire lives before I was 30. But I'm no worse for the wear.\u00a0Did I make it all up? Is it just my lone consciousness trying to create the illusion of time in the endless void... If that is the case I imagine the memories I have of you, of bliss, of \u00a0ecstasy, of unbridled passion and love that no words could possibly hope to elucidate. And conversely the constant pain and sorrow, regret and loneliness, the despair beyond all reason, the years of depression and anxiety without end.\u00a0These feelings and emotions must just be my higher self cycling through the entire range of human emotion, to experience all there is to experience. I have felt love so deep there is no measure to define it, and loss, pain equal to or greater than that.But now I sit and wonder, if nothing really matters, what's the point of trying anymore?\u00a0I've lived the life of a poor man, I've lived the life of a millionaire, my feelings never changed. Emptiness.\u00a0I've known heaven, it was in you, and you were mine.\u00a0And I truly believe you at least, to have been real. Perhaps the only real thing I ever experienced.I've known hell, I live it everyday, it's a non-stop droning always in the background, a deep dread and pressure on my entire being. I vibrate with pain daily.\u00a0If I'm alone, just a consciousness in a void. Then what is death? A reset? A chance to create a whole new world a different reality, to interact with and maybe learn and feel different things than I have here where I reside now.\u00a0It explains why I'm so tired being relatively young. My consciousness has been creating this world nonstop for 12,007 days, when do I get to rest.Amendment : day 12,008I think I'm hallucinating again.Something strange occurred this morning, I woke up at my usual hour, made breakfast, sat in my usual spot and turned on the news. Uneventful. I finished my meal and sat, my eyes became itchy and blurry, I chocked it up to allergies. Then I closed my eyes a second and suddenly it was 10 minutes later and I was face down on my empty plate.\u00a0I felt dizzy, my head felt as heavy as a wrecking ball, so I leaned back and closed my eyes again to gather my thoughts. After a few moments I attempted to open my eyes and found that I couldn't, they felt glued shut and I struggled for an indeterminate amount of time before they began to slowly and agonizingly painfully open. As they opened and I saw light again, thick blood red webbing appeared in my field of vision and as my eyes pulled apart the webbing stretched till after some effort my eyes were fully open.\u00a0At this point my breathing was erratic, it was a frightening ordeal. I lean back again and stared at the ceiling, breathing deep in an attempt to relax. But what I saw made things worse, right above me on the ceiling were 8 scrooge mcducks, with tophats and canes, dancing in a rhythmic circle. I stared a while, dumbfounded, looked away and back but they were still there. I sat up and looked straight ahead, unnerved and altogether unsure of what was happening.\u00a0I closed my eyes again and there on the inside of my eyelids was a number, counting down like the odometer on a car, it was something like \"1,284,543\" and rapidly getting lower. I snapped my eyes open and thought to myself, what the fuck is going on....I got up and went to my bedroom, stumbling clumsily, my body feeling like jelly and made it to the side of my unmade bed. I decided to make the bed to try and move past whatever this was.\u00a0The light was off in the room so it was dim, and when I leaned in to smooth out the covers I saw thousands of tiny orange ants crawling everywhere under the blanket on my sheets. I jumped back and questioned how the fuck I hadn't noticed while I slept. I quickly turned the lights on and went to investigate for any reason they might be there, but when I pulled back the covers there was nothing..my mind is playing tricks on me..I don't know what to do..so I just got back into bed and wrote this.\u00a0", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 66919, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 05:42:17 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "The story of Darth Plagueis The Wise, ever heard of it ?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7574, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 11:53:58 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Well it started like this:I was looking for an r/askreddit and ......", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1483, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 05:57:54 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "I feel like there is some kind of made up competition in the mind of my best friends wife between her and I.

Play wiffleball, throw frisbee football, soccer. Did not clean or cook and ate wonderfully. Its okay but my family is not happy with whats going on. Then i lose my job.

Still talk to her, she still loves me and i feel for her and her situation. I havent slept around. She claims the same. Im doing well again.

Let's assume no outside actors attempt to intercede- no foreign support, foreign invasion, and the territories will sit back and laugh as the country implodes.Various states will form alliances, coalitions, truces, or other informal agreements to avoid having to fight on every front at once. I'd imagine these will likely center around major military bases and wealthy cities. The Dakotas, for example, will struggle to defend themselves well due to the low population. But joined up with Minnesota, they will be better protected. Minnesota has natural borders to the north and east, and with the massive fields of the Dakotas acting as a buffer zone to the west, this area would be ideal as one of the major defensive zones. The problem is Chicago. Their area of influence will expand quickly, and Wisconsin is more likely to throw in with them than Minnesota. That means a lot of tension along the Mississippi river, and the northern marshland will make for cruel fighting conditions. Michigan is really a natural Ally to Minnesota. The two are far enough apart that it will be some time before they butt heads, and they can keep pressure on the Illinois/Wisconsin coalition.And that's really all I can say with any amount of certainty.

They get out of their hibernation a few times and [in those times they spend most of that asleep^1, ^2]( http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/276/2/r522).   * For humans the energy savings of sleeping vs laying awake but resting is the equivalent to a slice of bread (~50 calories). This is hardly worth losing vigilance for 1/3 the day for.   * The correlation of [body mass and sleep amount is weak at best^3]( https://www.dovepress.com/cr_data/article_fulltext/s80000/80731/img/fig3.jpg). Although generally smaller mammals, for example, sleep more than larger mammals, you can't really guess at the amount of sleep an organism has by their size.  e.g. Lions, Platypuses & chipmunks all sleep around the same amount of time^4.  * Almost every organism appears to have a sleep-like state^5. Even single cell organisms. With these organisms it's unclear if \"sleep\" is even happening, but it's doubtful that reduced stimuli responsiveness does much for their energy expenditure.   The third point, though, show that there is a bit of correlation (even if weak), which indicate that perhaps there are some side benefits of energy conservation in sleep.  I've only highlighted some of the key evidences about energy conservation. There are many, and there is wide consensus that energy conservation isn't the point of sleep.  I will say though, that I think we often make a mistake by trying to see a function of sleep as a ubiquitous thing that *must* be the same across all species (but that is just my thinking on this)   -----------------------------    ^1 ^http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/276/2/r522  ^2 ^http://physrev.physiology.org/content/83/4/1153  ^3 ^https://www.dovepress.com/cr_data/article_fulltext/s80000/80731/img/fig3.jpg  ^(from #4)    ^4 ^https://www.dovepress.com/the-influence-of-gravity-on-rem-sleep-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OAAP    ^5 ^(Sleep-like rather than \"sleep\" since we often define sleep as we see it in humans --i.e. laying down, less responsive to stimuli and brain changes-- but in many organisms, we can't see most of these with the exception of stimuli responsiveness.

And they did not try to detect krypton \u2014 I suspect, because it is a noble gas, that this would not be susceptible to this kind of method, but I am not a chemist in the slightest. Krypton was inferred as the other \"half\" of the uranium atom from the barium. There is a separate, physical science of identifying elements \u2014 spectroscopy \u2014 which is how krypton was discovered, as an aside.

We say that the derivative itself is an operator, which is a fancy for for a function that inputs functions and outputs functions, and denote it as \"D\", so D(f) is the derivative of f(x).  In this way, the second derivative is D^(2)(f)=D(D(f)). The third derivative is D^(3)(f)=D(D(D(f))). And so on.A Fractional Derivative is then an operator H, that takes in functions and outputs functions, so that H^(2)(f)=D(f), where H^(2)(f)=H(H(f)). In general, an A/B-th derivative operator is an operator D*_A/B_* so that D*_A/B_*^(B)(f) = D^(A)(f). You might then be able to extend it to irrational numbers via limits. There are a few different ways to construct these fractional operators: 1.) You can use Laplace Transforms. A [Laplace Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform) is a special kind of operator, and its most useful property is that it turns differentiation into multiplication. The Multiplication-by-x operator is a very basic operator that inputs the function f(x) and outputs xf(x). If L is the Laplace transform, then it turns differentiation into this operator. That is L(D(f))=xL(f). So, in Laplace-world, multiplication by x is the same thing as differentiation. Pretty cool (and useful). In general, multiplication by x^(N) in Laplace-world is the same thing as the Nth derivative. So to do derivatives we can just take a function, put it into Laplace-world, multiply it by x, and then send it back to where it came from. This looks like D(f) = L^(-1)(xL(f)). L(f) first sends it to Laplace-world, x just multiplies it by the variable, and then L^(-1) sends it back. Why not try to do this for *any* power of x? If r is any power that we can consider, then we can say that the r-th derivative of f(x) is * D*_r_*(f) = L^(-1)(x^(r)L(f))This is one notion of Fractional Derivatives. It should be noted that the Laplace Transform is kinda like a \"continuous\" version of a Taylor series. We're taking advantage of this to define arbitrary derivatives.  2.) Another way we can do it is through Complex Analysis. Complex Analysis is a magical place where amazing things happen to really nice functions. Particularly, we have the [Cauchy Integral Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_formula). This says that if we integrate f(z)/((2pi\\*i\\*(z-a)) around a circle, that has the point z=a on the inside, on the Complex Plane, then the we get the value f(a). This generalizes a bit. If we look at the value of the same kind of integral but of the function f(z)/((2pi\\*i\\*(z-a)^(n+1)) then we get the value D^(n)(f)(a), the nth derivative of f(z) evaluated at z=a. As above, nothing is stopping us from replacing the n with any arbitrary value. So we can say that the rth derivative D*_r_*(f) evaluated at z=a is the corresponding integral for f(z)/((2pi\\*i\\*(z-a)^(r+1)). It should be noted here that the Cauchy Integral Formula is a way to pick out Taylor coefficients for a differentiable function on the complex plane, and so we're taking advantage of this to define arbitrary derivatives. 3.) You can expand the limit definition of a derivative to get a formula for the nth derivative. This formula is not too messy, and  only involves combinations of the derivative, along with [binomial coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient).

Uh, this is money that goes to the insurance companies to line their pockets to raise up their stock prices and they've had a record run, they've had an incredible run and it's not appropriate. Obamacare is a disaster. It's virtually dead as far as I'm concerned, it really is dead and I predicted that a long time ago, it's a concept that doesn't work and we are very close we feel we have the votes, and as soon as we're finished with taxes, John, we really feel we have the votes to uh, get block grants into the states where the states can much better manage this money and much better take care of the people, rather than the federal government, the state block grants, we'll do massive block grants into the various states so that the states can run the program. So we feel we have the votes, we're going to be doing that after the taxes, in the meantime we're involved with a budget, and then after the budget hopefully that gets approved and after the budget assuming we have the support of all the republicans because we'll have no support from the democrats or almost no support because they've really become just obstructionists, they have no good policies, and frankly they're not good politicians, but they're very good obstructionists, and that's what they do well, obstruct. Uh, the number of nominees that I have approved by the democrats are about half of what President Obama had. And when you look at that, and you can look at judicial appointments, look how slow that's going. I'll have 145 ultimately, which is a tremendous number, we'll have 17 Court of Appeals appointments, but they're not getting approved they're being slow-walked by Schumer and the group of democrats that uh, really it's it's really disgraceful. Even people that they know they're going to approve, they take it right out to the end, they use every single minute and I think it's a very disgraceful situation, but Oca-- Obamacare is everything but dead, the people aren't gonna take it, the, they're not gonna take it, Alaska, they had over a 200% increase, in Arizona, they were 116% and I hear going up even higher and the people aren't gonna take that any longer.

The House Intelligence Committee has also interviewed Tait in its probe into Russia's election interference, according to CNN.Tait declined to comment. A spokesman for Mueller's office declined to comment.Mueller interviewed Tait months after Tait published a first-person account of his interactions with Smith on the national security blog, LawFare. In a piece titled \"The Time I Got Recruited to Collude with the Russians,\" Tait recalled how Smith had approached him to help verify the authenticity of emails he said were given to him by dark web hackers.\"Smith implied that he was a well-connected Republican political operative,\" Tait wrote, and had contacted him because he believed \"that Clinton\u2019s private email server had been hacked\u2014in his view almost certainly both by the Russian government and likely by multiple other hackers too.\"Tait said he went along with Smith's request because he wanted to find out more about these hackers \u2014 and whether they pranksters or part of a larger Russian intelligence front.He said he never found out. But he wrote that it was \"immediately apparent that Smith was both well connected within the top echelons of the [Trump] campaign and he seemed to know both Lt. Gen. [Michael] Flynn and his son well.\" Smith also listed top Trump advisers Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, and Sam Clovis as part of a group he had formed to conduct opposition research on Clinton.Tait's interaction with Smith went on for at least a few weeks, he wrote, and at one point he sent Tait a document detailing the company Smith and his colleagues had set up \"as a vehicle to conduct\" the opposition research.The company, KLS Research, had been set up as a limited-liability corporation in Delaware \"to avoid campaign reporting,\" wrote Tait, who said he didn't view the document as \"merely a name-dropping exercise.\" \"This document was about establishing a company to conduct opposition research on behalf of the campaign, but operating at a distance so as to avoid campaign reporting,\" Tait wrote.\"Indeed, the document says as much in black and white ... the combination of Smith\u2019s deep knowledge of the inner workings of the campaign, this document naming him in the 'Trump campaign' group, and the multiple references to needing to avoid campaign reporting suggested to me that the group was formed with the blessing of the Trump campaign,\" he said.Smith committed suicide in May after talking to The Wall Street Journal about his experience.Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser in February after reports emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his communication with Russia's former ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak.

The tales are not a manifestation of delusion or some broader type of psychosis\u2014on confrontation, the teller can admit they are untrue, even if unwillingly.[citation needed]The fabricative tendency is chronic. It is not provoked by the immediate situation or social pressure so much as it is an innate trait of the personality. There is some element of dyscontrol present.[citation needed]A definitely internal, not an external, motive for the behavior can be discerned clinically: e.g., long-lasting extortion or habitual spousal battery might cause a person to lie repeatedly, without the lying being a pathological symptom.[2]The stories told tend toward presenting the liar favorably. The liar \"decorates their own person\"[3] by telling stories that present them as the hero or the victim. For example, the person might be presented as being fantastically brave, as knowing or being related to many famous people, or as having great power, position, or wealth.Pathological lying may also present as false memory syndrome, where the sufferer genuinely believes that fictitious (imagined) events have taken place. Sufferers may believe they have accomplished superhuman feats or awe-inspiring acts of altruism and love\u2014or have committed equally grandiose acts of diabolical evil, for which they must atone or already have atoned in their fantasies.[citation needed]Some psychiatrists distinguish compulsive from pathological lying, while others consider them equivalent; yet others deny the existence of compulsive lying altogether; this remains an area of considerable controversy.[4]Sauce: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_lying#Characteristics", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 76375, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 21:06:08 2017", "ups": 1}], "subreddit": "politics", "selftext": "", "libertarian": 0.2621343434, "id": "76ztu5", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "'Disrespectful lie': Anger grows over Trump\u2019s claims about past presidents and fallen troops", "num_comments": 437, "conservative": 0.3788959086, "pinned": false, "score": 5861, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 5082, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/76ztu5/disrespectful_lie_anger_grows_over_trumps_claims/", "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 20:47:33 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "As a reminder, this subreddit [is for civil discussion.](/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil)In general, be courteous to others.

Bush. It has been credited with reducing the percentage of uninsured children from close to 14 percent before the law was enacted to 4.5 percent in 2015.

Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency.Healthy individuals lead to a healthy society.  This is why I shake my head when people say, \"Why should I pay higher premiums so others don't have to?\"  Because you can and others can't.  *Everyone* should have access to health care, period.

So the price hike adds about $1.5B in revenues (104M subs * 12mo * $1.25/mo avg hike), meaning that NLFX is going to add ~$6.5B in debt.  And management seems to indicate that its not ending anytime soon - from the 3Q17 investor letter: \"With $17 billion in content commitments over the next several years.....We\u2019ll spend $7-8 billion on content (on a P&L basis) in 2018.\"  But the thing is they can't stop there as 'content' gets stale over time.  So they are relying on debt to get there.  They had $2B in debt at the start of 2015, they have $5B today and they are planning on roughly taking it to $18B-$20B over the next few years ($6.5B * 2 + the existing $5B).  They could go as high as $22B if they planing on funding all $17B of forward media buys with debt.OK - that's **A LOT** of debt load to add, and sometimes that can be okay.  However, here's the kicker: since the start of 2015, NFLX has burned ~$4B of free cash on just an operating basis since 2015 (and $1.6B in just 2016).  And look - I **love** my membership to Netflix, but this is a company living on credit cards.  They are spending *wayyy* more than they take in on just operating activities and then they are using debt to 'finance' their way to growth. And here's a second kicker: people always say \"well the debt's secured by the media assets - they can just sell the media assets to cover the debt.\"  This is true; however, the biggest media securitization I have ever heard of was the Miramax collection which was in the few hundreds of million of dollars (yes, when you watch Pulp Fiction, a hedge fund gets a few bucks.)  There is no precedent for the sale/securitization of a billion dollar collection, much less a multi-billion dollar property set.  And keep in mind that in *every* scenario like above, the equity gets zeroed.  Its definitely an interesting stock.....perhaps a far better service than company or investment.  ***EDIT at 5pm*** - holy shit this blew up!  In the interest of fairness, I am going to briefly give you the 'bull case' on NFLX (eg the argument that the stock will go up); however, I will also tell you that I have been pitched NFLX debt in the past and turned it down (and will almost certainly turn it down again).  Source: ~20yrs doing debt cap mkts/debt investing on Wall St.  The 'buy NFLX' thesis centers on exactly one word ***INTERNATIONAL***.  To start, look [here](https://ir.netflix.com/events.cfm) to see NFLX's recent financials.  Digging into this, you'll see the following:  ~104M subs roughly evenly split between 50% US and 50% international.  However, US sub growth is ~7% YoY **BUT** international sub growth is ~28% YoY.  You'll also see that US subs pay ~$9.60/mo, but international subs pay ~$7.10/mo (both on a TTM basis and before the recent hike).So you're probably seeing where this is going: ***IF*** NFLX can see another 4 years of International sub growth in the 25% YoY range, they'll have ~130M International subs, and assuming 5% US growth, they have ~62M US subs for (call it) 200M total subs.  Let's also say that you can 'catch up' the international monthly cost to the US monthly cost ***AND*** grow the US monthly cost ~5% YoY, you'll be left with the 200M subs paying about $11.50/mo (note this mean that int'l will see much higher rate increases than the US but also still grow fast as shit).  This gets you to about $28B in TOTAL revenues and be *roughly* cash flow positive and the business model approximately works.  You'd get (call it) $28B revs at (call it) a 25% FCF contribution margin (~$7B FCF), and then **ALL** of it goes back into original programming and they are **ASLO** able to securitize out 'legacy' shows to sterilize the legacy debt.  Yes, I know we can debate these numbers all day long, but this a functional model of what it would take for the company to 'work' from a business perspective.However, you have to remember that to achieve 25% international growth (eg 'capture' another 80M international customers), NFLX will have to devote significant sums to international programming, which might make NFLX less attractive to US subs.  Also, there's no guarantee that NFLX can even get its programming into lucrative markets like China/India **and** be successful with their programming.  And then there are 1,000 other issues that I'm not even mentioning here.  Its just massively fucking risky in my view.

Instead, the surveillance has been turned back on us.This is false, and they've given zero reason to believe that it's true. They're required to target foreigners on foreign soil for foreign intelligence purposes. That's the entire point of the law.> Despite repeated inquiries from Congress, the NSA has yet to publicly disclose how many Americans are impacted by this surveillance.Because they've repeatedly told you that it's impossible and explained why it's impossible. Let's think about boring ol' domestic criminal investigations for a minute. The FBI gets enough evidence to target Tony Soprano with a wiretap. He talks to other people on the phone (that's, uh, the purpose of a phone). Some of these people are innocent, and hell, some even ~~are American~~ have blue eyes. Anyway, the FBI collects these wiretaps for a couple months, and then you ask them, \"How many ~~Americans~~ people with blue eyes are impacted by your surveillance of Tony Soprano?\" Your answer is going to be, \"I have no fucking clue. How could I possibly know that? I'd have to track down every single person (most of whom I don't give a shit about unless their conversation with Tony indicated nefarious activity) and invade their privacy further in order to figure that out.\" This fundamental dynamic is exactly the same thing that's going on with foreign signals intelligence, and it's simply a category error to claim that this means either that Title III (authorizing domestic criminal wiretaps) has been \"turned against innocent people with blue eyes\" or that 702 has been \"turned against Americans\".> The bill doesn\u2019t effectively end the practice of \u201cbackdoor searching,\u201d when government agents\u2014including domestic law enforcement not working on issues of national security\u2014search through the NSA-gathered communications of Americans without any form of warrant from a judge. It doesn\u2019t institute adequate transparency and oversight measures, and it doesn\u2019t deal with misuse of the state secrets privilege, which has been invoked to stave off lawsuits against mass surveillance.  These are all conclusions, not arguments. Maybe they'll get to arguments.> Perhaps most importantly, the bill won\u2019t curtail the NSA\u2019s practices of collecting data on innocent people. This is another way of saying, \"Tony Soprano talks to other people, and some of those people are innocent.\" *Yawn*Ok, it looks like we're getting to more details. They actually have a decent description of the programs, including an admission that, \"The NSA is only allowed to target non-Americans located outside U.S. borders.\" Yet, after their description, they revert back to preaching to the choir, saying, \"Unfortunately, the Liberty Act won\u2019t address most of these fundamental problems.\" The only problem is that they didn't bother actually identifying any \"fundamental problems\"! It really sounds like they think the \"fundamental problem\" is that the NSA engages in covert foreign signals intelligence. That's a feature, not a bug!They describe the idea of \"backdoor searches\", and even identify that USALA implements a warrant requirement. Then,> the warrant requirement is limited due to a number of troubling carve-outs. First, this court oversight requirement won\u2019t be triggered except for those searches conducted to find evidence of a crime. No other searches for any other purposes will require court oversight, including when spy agencies search for foreign intelligence, and when law enforcement agencies explore whether a crime occurred at all.Yea, foreign intelligence agencies should be able to go through their foreign intelligence databases for foreign intelligence. What everyone cares about here is what they have to do for domestic crimes (everyone is freaked out that NSA is going to bust them for smoking weed or something). Unfortunately, it just looks like EFF is being willfully obtuse with their reading of the law. Searching for evidence of a crime includes evidence that a crime occurred, and they would never argue otherwise in an actual court of law.This bit really flabbergasts me, because the big thing pro-privacy groups were asking for prior to the release of this draft was exactly this warrant requirement. They got *exactly* what they wanted, and it's really weird to see them try to spin out some incomprehensible objection to having gotten exactly what they wanted.> Metadata\u2014how many communications are sent, to whom, at what times\u2014won\u2019t require court oversight at all.Right. The FBI can go use a standard subpoena (without court oversight) to collect *and* use your metadata right now for standard criminal investigations. The Supreme Court has condoned this practice for decades - long before Section 702 was a thing. This difference is reflecting that reality.> In the Massie-Lofgren Amendment, which passed the House twice, agents who conducted queries for metadata would be required to show the metadata was relevant to an investigation. That relevance standard is not in the Liberty Act.I'm actually fine with that requirement (though, it's not what you said it did [a few months ago](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/eff-statement-massie-lofgren-amendment-passing-house)). Hey, we can agree on something!> Finally, some may interpret vague language in the bill as putting responsibility for assessing probable cause in the hands of the Attorney General, the main governmental prosecutor, rather than in the hands of the FISA Court.Boring. I'm fine with wordsmithing. Anyway, in sum, it looks like this bill really embraces the big things that are important for privacy concerns, and the only real complaints are piddly little things that can pretty easily be tweaked as the debate continues. Certainly doesn't sound like a cause of all the hyperbole you started with.> The bill will require the NSA to exercise \u201cdue diligence in determining whether a person targeted is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States,\u201d and requires agents to consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d when making that evaluation.> At face value, this sounds promising. We do want the NSA to exercise due diligence when evaluating targets of surveillance. However, this provision is more of a fig leaf than a real fix, because even if targeting is improved, it won\u2019t resolve the problem of Americans\u2019 communications being collected. Right now, countless Americans are surveilled through so-called \u201cincidental collection.\u201d This means that while the official target was a non-American overseas, American communications are swept up as well. Even though Americans were never the intended \u201ctarget,\u201d their emails, chats, and VOIP calls end up in a database accessible to the NSA, FBI, and others. Tightening up targeting won\u2019t address this problem.\"Tony Soprano talks to other people on the phone.\"> In addition, the bill doesn\u2019t change the NSA\u2019s practice of intercepting communications of countless innocent foreigners outside the United States. People outside our national borders are not criminals by default and should not be treated as if they were.Not criminals. Foreign intelligence targets. When the President says, \"I want to know what the President of Russia/Iran/North Korea is saying,\" he's not saying, \"I think that guy has committed a crime in some jurisdiction in the United States.\" Sections like this really leave you wondering if they have a clue why we created the NSA to begin with.Concerning data retention,> the Liberty Act does not solve this problem. Rather, it would only require that if the NSA determines that a communication lacks foreign intelligence value, then the NSA must purge it within 90 days. However, it\u2019s unclear how often the NSA reviews its collected data to assess its foreign intelligence value. Since the bill requires no review, this provision may have little practical effect.Those things are found in [the minimization procedures](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3718787/2016-NSA-Section-702-Minimization-Procedures-Sep.pdf).> The Liberty Act includes a section that would extend certain whistleblower protections to federal contractors. However, these protections only apply to \u201clawful disclosure\u201d to a handful of government officers, such as the Director of National Intelligence. It does not provide any protection when a whistleblower speaks to the media or to advocacy organizations such as EFF.Yea, that's the standard whistleblower protection that is the case for all whistleblower protections across the government (so maybe there's a reason it's that way).> Furthermore, the bill only protects whistleblowers against \u201cpersonnel action,\u201d so whistleblowers could still face criminal prosecution....dat \"lawful disclosure\"...> To make matters worse, the bill also creates new penalties for the unauthorized removal or retention of classified documents, including when done negligently. This will likely be another tool used to go after whistleblowers.We've had how many cases of NSA's information getting out recently!? How many times have people said, \"They need to be held accountable for this\"?! Now all of sudden, you *don't* like them being held accountable? Make up your mind.You can at least admit that the bill embraces your requests to codify the ending of \"about\" collection, to have a sunset provision, and to improve the PCLOB and FISC amicus.

If a man has been assaulted or harassed, there is nothing in the hashtag to prevent him from sharing his experience as well, and from what I've seen, the men who have done so in a way to honestly bring light to the issue of sexual assault have received support just like women. The problem is that many men are uncomfortable with conversations about men that do not revolve around or include a male point of view. I can understand this as I'm frustrated by conversations about women that do not revolve around or include a female point of view. The difference is that the latter is the default view of society and the former is rare. So when men get worked up that a conversation about them focused on women's experiences, I just want to smash things. It's like, this is social media and we are talking about our lifetime experiences of sexual violence. Meanwhile, the male dominant point of view is all over the place- including their opinions literally affecting what health care we receive. So if a guy is so uncomfortable with this conversation not including an acknowledgement of the issues HE thinks it should, then that tells me more about just how rarely he's ever been on the outside of a conversation. It's also false, because like I said, plenty of men have joined this conversation- either to share their own stories of assault or to show solidarity with victims- and they are not pushed out.It reminds me of children who complain that since there is a mother's day and a father's day, there should also be a child's day just for them.

As in, \"#ihave met a kind gentleman who stood up for me\" or \"#ihave helped a girl out of a sexual predator situation\". This, he says, is meant to illustrate a \"more positive view of the matter\", because \"not everything needs to be negative\". It's been a couple of days, and he is already saying, \"I get the point, but not all men\"? Obviously we've all met nice people. This is nothing special. I don't see how this helps.

I do agree that the unique issues men face need serious awareness. But this is not the time nor place.

It's honestly easier to sweep things under the figurative rug than to face the reality.   A counter hashtag is a terrible idea for the reasons you've said. I hope that doesn't happen.   However. If a counter hashtag were to happen, I think it should be this: #ihave dismissed a friend's rape claims. #ihave catcalled women in the street. #ihave ignored safewords. #ihave not taken no for an answer. #ihave committed microaggressions against women. #ihave made jokes at the expense of women. #ihave mansplained to friends i claim to respect.   I guarentee that every man in today's society could find something to post with that. I think admittance will be a huge part of making changes as we go down this road together ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 3615, "stickied": false, "score": 8, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 20:26:35 2017", "ups": 8}, {"body": "Yeah I hear you. One thing I don't understand about that is, the hashtag is #metoo. If a man has been assaulted or harassed, there is nothing in the hashtag to prevent him from sharing his experience as well, and from what I've seen, the men who have done so in a way to honestly bring light to the issue of sexual assault have received support just like women. The problem is that many men are uncomfortable with conversations about men that do not revolve around or include a male point of view. I can understand this as I'm frustrated by conversations about women that do not revolve around or include a female point of view. The difference is that the latter is the default view of society and the former is rare. So when men get worked up that a conversation about them focused on women's experiences, I just want to smash things. It's like, this is social media and we are talking about our lifetime experiences of sexual violence. Meanwhile, the male dominant point of view is all over the place- including their opinions literally affecting what health care we receive. So if a guy is so uncomfortable with this conversation not including an acknowledgement of the issues HE thinks it should, then that tells me more about just how rarely he's ever been on the outside of a conversation. It's also false, because like I said, plenty of men have joined this conversation- either to share their own stories of assault or to show solidarity with victims- and they are not pushed out.It reminds me of children who complain that since there is a mother's day and a father's day, there should also be a child's day just for them.

I didn't have the courage to share being sexually abused by my mothers bf at age 5).>> I know that most women probably have been victimized more than me, but it does happen to men too.>> People should treat people like people. Period.Several of my friends and relatives, mostly female, offered comfort, said I'm sorry to hear that, said good point, we shouldn't forget about the non-male-on-female victims either, etc. etc. etc....except one of my female friends.  She wrote a long comment that essentially said: (1) I'm sorry it happened to you, but (2) it happened to me way worse, and (3) it happens to women more, so again I'm sorry but your post is detracting the the focus of #metoo.My wife and a few other women stepped up to defend my post (my wife was especially defensive because she knows about my mom's ex-bf).  They acknowledged that men-on-women assault is the most prevalent, but that my words seemed to be done in the spirit of unity, and in any case no victim should ever be marginalized.  **Basically, we can bring awareness to the fact that harassment against women is so widespread while also acknowledging any victim.**Needless to say, my friend didn't like this.  She proceeded to send me lengthy private messages, all starting and ending with how she's sorry it happened to me, but that she thinks the #metoo movement is for women only.  It seems she feels that posts like mine are hijacking the #metoo movement (...but that it's totally okay for men to speak out ...but just not with now with #metoo ...but all victims should speak if they want to ...but just not men right now because they shift the narrative... etc. etc. etc.)My first few responses to her were (1) to apologize because that wasn't my intent, (2) to tell her that her interpretation of #metoo as only for men-on-women victims is not universal, and (3) to say that her comments are making me feel marginalized, that I should quiet down, and that I don't have the right to feel the way I do because I'm not a woman.We went in circles like this for awhile.  Me voicing the fact that I didn't mean my post like that and that she's hurting my feelings; and her voicing her opinion that #metoo is about women only and how I shouldn't have said what I said how and when I said it (especially my last two sentences.)I got so frustrated that I just deleted my post out of anger.  I told her that she won -- now none of the 20 people who read my posts on FB will be confused about the fact #metoo should be about men-on-women assault only!Sorry for the long post.  I don't know why I'm sharing this on here... I guess for support and just to get it off my chest.  Not only do I feel shitty because I keep thinking about my abuse, but I feel like I have no voice and that I'm stupid for sharing.**EDIT:** Thank you all -- your comments have seriously turned my day around.**EDIT 2:** Oh yeah, she used [this article](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Why-MeToo-can-be-for-men-too-12281653.php) to point out to me that she's not the only one to think #metoo is for women only!

He then proceeds to tell his friends something like this:\"Oh yes, I remember meeting aliverunner5! We were in this bar, and she was sitting alone drinking nothing but a coke. So I sat next to her and offered to buy her a beer. And she said, oh I don't drink. And I said aw, come on! Why don't you drink? She told me, I used to like drinking, but I stopped because every time I drank, something funny happened to my legs. That's weird, I thought, something funny happens to your legs? What are you talking about? And aliverunner5, she said yeah. Whenever I drink, my legs open up.\"His whole friend group, around a dozen people, was laughing hysterically at me as my face blushed bright red. Then a woman in his group said through her laughter, \"Oh come on, that's not nice! The young lady who you told that to last year got all offended when you told her that.\" But then my coworker, who had been laughing like the rest of them, chimes in, \"Yeah, that was ***, she just can't take a joke. She's way too serious about stuff. Nobody liked her, I'm glad she doesn't work here anymore. But you can take a joke right?\" he says looking at me. As we walk away, he kept talking about how funny that guy is, he's great, isn't he?And it was a joke, and maybe it doesn't sound like it should have been that big of a deal. But I was 18 at the time. I was 18, and I felt vulnerable, and I felt completely invalidated by my coworker, and I felt ashamed that the joke made me feel like crap. I didn't tell anyone, because I thought it probably was my fault for being too sensitive. But looking back, I realize that maybe I shouldn't place all the blame on myself for feeling like crap.

I\u2019m also grateful for the fact that hashtags and mentions on social media trends can kind of work as a quantifiable representation of an issue, so now there are some numbers (and names along with those stats) to back up the for some reason \u201cunproven\u201d reality that so many of us have lived with forever.But it seems - or I guess it should be - unnecessary.  Because I don\u2019t think I know a single woman or girl who hasn\u2019t experienced sexual harassment and most of the time much worse.  I swear, when you get a group of us together, everyone has a story or stories that would make you cry.  Seeing all these \u201cMe too\u201ds doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least.  And I don\u2019t get why this is being treated as some sort of catalyst for mass realization by men, since most men know perfectly well what goes on and have chosen over and over again to not really confront it or delve into it.ONE - probably the worst but certainly not the only - of my experiences (writing now as a 24 year old woman) to set some context:A relative (in-law, not blood, not that it matters) started molesting me when I was about 11 and it continued until I was 16.  I didn\u2019t really tell anyone about it until much later, because I felt dirty and complicit for continuing to put myself in situations and for \u2018asking for it.\u2019 Although how a middle schooler can ask for a hand down the pants from a 40 year old uncle, you tell me\u2026 but grooming is a powerful thing and it really fucked with my head.  It only stopped because there was a really scary incident where I finally had enough and finally had the agency to never see him again.  I suppressed most of what happened and didn\u2019t talk about it for years, until his wife (my step-mom\u2019s sister, my aunt) contacted me and told me that he\u2019d been doing it to other young girls and asked me to testify.  She had suspected it for years but had chosen to ignore it.  Apparently the most recent time had been with her best friend\u2019s teenage daughter while they were at their house for Thanksgiving, and that was the last straw.  I reluctantly told my story to the cops, mostly because he had a daughter and his wife was begging me to help me protect her from him.  Testifying was horrible.  I was a college senior dealing with tons of other shit and did it over the phone in over the course of a few hours of question and answer sessions.  The police pretty much blamed everything on me, were suspicious and judgmental, used my lack of memory of specifics as proof that I was an unreliable witness.  (He used to heavily encourage me to drink alcohol with him starting when I was about 12 or 13, and I guess on the night when he drove me out a canyon and made me lie on the ground so he could feel my 14 year-old breasts and vagina before he\u2019d drive me back\u2026 since I couldn\u2019t remember whether it was 2 or 5 beers, or when I fell off a rope swing and cracked my tailbone while boating with him and his wife and kids when I was 16 and he handed me cup after cup of tequila until I was falling down and he \u201chelped me into the car\u201d by reaching a hand up my shirt and holding my breast for a few minutes and sticking his hand up my crotch while \u201chelping me get my seatbelt on\u201d and I couldn\u2019t remember how many solo cups of tequila he gave me, these were reasons why my testimony was questionable.) Anyhow, I did it and it sucked.  And then I waited to find out what would happen to him, nervous but feeling vindicated.  Then I found out a little later that his wife had decided to stay with him and so had told the cops I was lying and they dropped the case.  I also dropped it, because that had been my crash course in how shitty the system was and I didn\u2019t want to do anything like that again.I had told a few people in my town (a boyfriend, some friends) at the time when I was about 15-16, and their advice was to just steer clear of him, because it was a known secret that he did this to young girls.  People knew, it was a known thing, but nobody said anything and nobody did anything.Over the next few years after my covered up testimony (thanks to his WIFE, who is still with him), I told many of my friends (women were sad but not surprised, men were uncomfortable and changed the subject), I told my ex-step mom (the sister in law of the man who did it) and she was devastated she had never picked up on it happening to me but was also unsurprised he did it, my really great boyfriend (who didn\u2019t know how to react and still tries to avoid talking about it), and I told my dad (who was brothers in law with this guy for a few years), who is a wonderful man and a wonderful father and was so hurt and scared and confused to hear this\u2026 but who also did nothing and hasn\u2019t done anything to confront him or really acknowledged it since our really uncomfortable conversation when I told him.Oh, did I tell you that he used to be a ski coach for the 9-14 year old girls\u2019 ski team? I know he touched a few girls that I personally know, and I would think he's touched more.  Last time I was home, I saw him at an end of the ski season tailgate giving beers to a teenage girl.  I didn\u2019t go up and confront him because I\u2019m scared of him and he knows that I testified against him and I haven\u2019t looked him in the face since I was 16 years old.  And even then, I feel guilty and complicit, even though there are other more qualified and less vulnerable people who should be doing it them-fucking-selves.Basically a bunch of people in my town know that this guy molests young girls, they know that he has in the past and they know that he did it to me, and they all choose to interact with him, give his auto body shop business, ignore his known \u2018creepiness\u2019 and do nothing about it except talk in hushed tones when it gets brought up.  I probably should do more, but fuck that.  His wife knows, she asked me to testify, I did, and then she got back with him and is brushing his crimes under the rug.  I have moved on, I live in a different country, I don\u2019t want to open that can of worms.  But I\u2019m still hurt by the number of people who knew then and who know now who have done nothing and said nothing.  And my small town molestation experience sounds a whole lot like the Harvey Weinstein deal.  And this wasn't the only time I've been assaulted, that shit would come later.  Basically, this shit happens everywhere and on every level, and why is everyone acting surprised?  Men who love me, who really really truly love me and care for me, shy away when I dare to tell them what I\u2019ve experienced.  They don\u2019t know how to react and so they push it away and move on from it.Guys I\u2019ve dated, really serious long term boyfriends, male friends who are in some cases even closer than lovers, family members, my dad\u2026 clammed up when I worked up the courage to tell them about my realities. And often times, after I\u2019ve shared with them, we never speak of it again because it makes them uncomfortable.  I can tell you this \u2014 none of them encouraged me to press legal action, none of them confronted the men who assaulted me (even though some of my loved ones knew these men personally), and none of them ever brought it up again.So it\u2019s not like there\u2019s been some miraculous ignorance about shit like this.  Women of course have always known, because we\u2019ve all experienced it on one level or another. Women sometimes don\u2019t protect each other, but more often than not they get it without explanation and they help each other.  Men have also known \u2014 and if they act like they don\u2019t, they have absolutely had many many chances to know \u2014 but they usually choose to stay blissfully ignorant or to forget what they\u2019ve learned.So this \u201cMe too\u201d thing might last for what, 24 hours? 48? This Harvey Weinstein story is probably going to lose traction in a matter of days or weeks.  How in the world is a short-lived social media trend going to change anything?I didn\u2019t share stories of my years-long molestation and assault as a pubescent teen or the time I was raped or the COUNTLESS moments I\u2019ve been harassed and targeted and scared by men, both familiar and strange, on Facebook, because I know from experience that it makes people (men) uncomfortable.  And that if I shared that on Facebook, it would forever change the way acquaintances, friends, and family thought of me \u2014 but it for sure wouldn\u2019t change the realities of being a woman.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "76uwc8", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Why I'm Frustrated With This \"Me Too\" Trend", "num_comments": 4, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 27, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 24, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/76uwc8/why_im_frustrated_with_this_me_too_trend/", "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 04:27:52 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "I completely agree with you.

However, my big issue with it is that while it's highlighting the magnitude of the problem for people that didn't really grasp it before, it's lacking in action items, and a lot of people are just kind of... vaguely expressing that they're against sexual assault and that they're sorry it happened to people.  Nothing wrong with that obviously, but it doesn't really cut it.  I posted something on Facebook that I really think is worth sharing, and I wanted to give everyone here the opportunity to read it, share it, whatever (throwaway because I don't want my reddit linked to my Facebook).  I think giving people the tools they need to change our culture is very important.  So please, take what's below, edit it or add to it as you see fit, and share it so we can use the momentum of \"me too\" to get people involved in doing the small, achievable things that will make a difference.I hope this helps someone.---------------------For everyone posting \"me too\", I see you and I ache with you. Thank you.For everyone NOT posting \"me too\", I know you're there, and I ache with you too. Remember, you don't owe your pain to anyone.Context: a status is going around to this effect: \"If all the people who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote \"Me too\" as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.\"How many of your loved ones are sharing this? How many more unseen are holding back? Are you horrified and wish someone would *do* something?***Here's what YOU can do about it***If you have or work with children:Teach them their bodies are their own and no one has a right to do anything to them that makes them uncomfortable. Other people don't get to touch their private parts. Don't pressure your children to give hugs and kisses to friends or relatives when they're uncomfortable, because this signals to them that it's okay for other people to choose to do things to their bodies against their will. This goes for you too, do not hug or kiss a child that doesn't want you to.Teach your children the importance of acquiring consent from other people, and respecting when other people tell them \"no\". Not just for sexual things, but things like sharing toys and getting hugs.Teach your children violence is for self defense, not for taking things from others.Teach your children it's bad when people, especially adults, ask them to keep secrets from their parents.The above is also something adults should be learning, but like most things, it works a lot better if you start instilling it at a young age.For everyone else:Practice putting your own safety over worrying about making others uncomfortable. If someone is talking to you in a way that bothers you, or doing something to you that makes you uncomfortable, you have the right to leave, or say no, or shove someone off of you, and you are not an asshole for looking after yourself. Your safety is far more important than whether you make someone uncomfortable.Speak up when someone expresses even the mildest version of any of the ideas that enable or encourage sexual assault. Ideas like someone owes them sex. Someone wants sex even though they say they don't. It's okay to do things to someone that doesn't understand or isn't conscious. Boys will be boys. Challenge the person saying it. Explain why they're wrong. Explain why these ideas hurt people. Explain why these ideas can convince impressionable people that it's okay to do things that cause extensive emotional and psychological harm to others. If the person saying it doesn't change their tune (and maybe even if they do), spread the word that they're dangerously inconsiderate of others' boundaries and safety, so your loved ones know not to get caught alone with this person.Take self defense classes if you can, and reaffirm to yourself your right to use what you've learned on anyone that tries to hurt you. If you can't take classes, sticking your fingers in someone's eyes or kneeing them in the crotch (as hard as you can) is a good standby for the untrained individual.Make it known that you are an advocate of sexual assault survivors, and behave like one (don't question whether someone was \"acting appropriately\" or if they're telling the truth) so that survivors are less afraid to report and come forward.Remember that you are also capable of doing things that hurt others through carelessness, and seek consent yourself, rather than assuming it. Respect the bodily autonomy of others, and remember that the smallest transgression can cause long-term trauma, even if you didn't mean to do it.If you have suffered sexual trauma, remember to take care of yourself, love yourself, and forgive your past self for anything you wish you would have done differently.I challenge everyone who's upset by these posts to do at least one of these things, as soon and as often as possible.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "76uqwm", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "What you can realistically do about sexual assault in the wake of Me Too", "num_comments": 7, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 25, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 20, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/76uqwm/what_you_can_realistically_do_about_sexual/", "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 04:02:57 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "* We need a new threshold of consent\u2014enthusiastic* We need to end that cultural thing where men prove their testosterone levels by being sexually aggressive (for example: grab 'em by the pussy)", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 9316, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 10:59:20 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "And a link to a blog post that expands a little on the ideas behind how to treat children with regards to secrets, consent, etc: http://denver.citymomsblog.com/parenting/why-we-dont-keep-secrets-in-our-house/ ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 12, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 04:03:39 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "I like what you're thinking.

It started right before my eighteenth birthday. His close friend was a photographer who I had modeled for in the past. It had been very positive, lots of fun nature shoots and I was very comfortable with him since he was close to my boyfriend. I remember my boyfriend saying \u201cI can\u2019t wait until you\u2019re 18 and you can take professional quality nudes with him.\u201dI shrugged it off and thought he was joking. When I turned 18, I didn\u2019t think much of it. Me and his friend had a photoshoot planned and I brought my favorite jacket and my new boots. I was so excited. He took about ten pictures of me in my favorite outfit and then asked me to take my clothes off.I didn\u2019t want to. I was scared. I was alone, with a storm outside, in a house with no reception in the hills with a boy who knew the area while I didn\u2019t. I listened to him.I told him I was uncomfortable and that these pictures were to go nowhere. He agreed. He kept trying to get me in more suggestive positions, and every time the camera flashed I felt anxiety grow and fester. He would say \"just one more, stop covering your tits\" but it went on for so much longer than I could handle. Eventually it stopped and he drove me home.He sent me the pictures and I was too disgusted to look at them.He also sent them to my boyfriend.My boyfriend used to tell me I was so attractive because I was so skinny. He said he loved seeing my bones protruding. Imagine the impact this has on a young girl and her relationship with food. Being told by the person she\u2019s closest to and cares about that she is only worth something when you can see her bones.I forgot about the pictures. I started falling even further behind in school. I decided not to go to college. I told my ex to stop having sex with me one Halloween, that I felt sick, but he kept going. I thought it was normal because we were dating, and he cuddled me afterwards. I began to flinch at physical touch. I stopped taking care of myself. I cut off all my hair when he told me I would no longer be attractive to him if it were short. I wanted him to avoid having sex with me.I slowly caught on to how manipulative it all was. He was older than me and he knew how I felt. He did what he could to get what he wanted - which was sex, or sexy pictures, or power.Then the pictures surfaced on reddit. Including my first and last name. The front page of an extremely popular NSFW subreddit. For days. I messaged people desperately; one of the pictures was actually an underage selfie I had sent to him. Everything was leaked. I confronted him and he claimed it wasn\u2019t his fault; that he never posted the images. He just sent them to his friends to \u201cbrag\u201d.I began to resent myself. Every time the pictures resurfaced, I wanted to die. I was reminded of how weak I felt and how manipulated I was and how I was never going to escape these photos. They were passed around at parties. I received messages from concerned friends, countries away, who had seen them. I knew I was always going to have this horrible part of this horrible relationship on the internet. I learned that no one wants to help you remove private photos. I learned that people on the internet are cruel. A few years went by and I cut ties with both of these people and started taking care of myself. It took so long, but I finally feel like I\u2019m on the right track.I started dating an extremely kind man eventually - and of course, right on cue, the photos pop up on an online bullying site. I read through pages of people making fun of me, using personal details only my ex could know, mocking my new boyfriend, my looks, my naked, scared, and vulnerable body. I felt sick.I knew then exactly how deeply this had affected me, and I\u2019m not going to be silent about it any longer. I was completely taken advantage of more times than I can count during this relationship by someone who tries to lie about it to this day. I finally had the courage to write it all down, so I\u2019m sorry if I rambled or didn\u2019t make sense at points. It just feels kind of calming to type out this shitty timeline. To anyone who might be reading - the pictures we all see might have some darker context than they portray. I try to treat everyone a little kinder because of it. Thanks for listening.

OP said she doesn't think he ever assaulted anyone; she's commending him for taking (and for encouraging others to take) a good hard look at all their previous actions to consider how to make this world a safer place for everyone except rapists.\"He's not saying he's sexually assaulted or harassed anyone or that every man has. He's saying exactly what the paragraph above says and is recognizing a societal problem that allows this kind of thing to happen.  Ever been somewhere where you've seen men or women getting harassed and done nothing about it? Said nothing about it? Laughed at a stupid joke in high school or turned the other way? Kept your head down and said \"I'm glad it's not me?\" I know I have, and I'm a woman.  I think the problem goes both ways - extends to men and women and all forms of sexuality.  It's a problem NOT exclusive to men, but I don't think men, especially, think about how many women around them have been affected by harassment.It's not just some guy jumping out of the bushes or ambushing you. It's a regular thing that happens subtly, and not just to women.  Often people - and you see this with politicians - are able to form a better sense of empathy when they can associate something they don't think about or understand with someone they personally know, which is why the magnitude of the \"me too\" comments and hashtags, etc., are designed to make an impact.Edit 2: Why can't we have discussions in this sub without being downvoted to hell and back?

From an excellent article here by Randall Lane from Forbes>The most in-demand person on the planet has gone into hold-all-my-calls mode for nearly two hours to sit down with FORBES and tackle, piece by piece, a subject that he cares about to the depths of his soul: how much FORBES says he's worth. Since The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans debuted in 1982, the dynamism of the U.S. economy and the hand of the grim reaper have resulted in exactly 1,538 people making the cut at one time or another. Of those 1,538 tycoons, not one has been more fixated with his or her net worth estimate on a year-in, year-out basis than Donald J. Trump.>Trump's valuation this year holds extra importance, of course, due to his audacious second act: his highly unlikely--but no longer inconceivable--path to the presidency. Trump has filed statements claiming he's worth at least $10 billion or, as he put in a press release, TEN BILLION DOLLARS (capitalization his). After interviewing more than 80 sources and devoting unprecedented resources to valuing a single fortune, we're going with a figure less than half that--$4.5 billion, albeit still the highest figure we've ever had for him.>\"I'm running for President,\" says Trump. \"I'm worth much more than you have me down [for]. I don't look good, to be honest. I mean, I look better if I'm worth $10 billion than if I'm worth $4 billion.\">To The Forbes 400 crowd, perhaps. But when pushed, even Trump concedes that, for voters, the difference between $4 billion and $10 billion is as abstractly irrelevant as a star that's either 4 billion or 10 billion light-years away. Ultimately, Trump's beef with our numbers is driven by Trump: how his peers view him and, more acutely, how he views himself. It always has been. The paradoxical Trump that now transfixes American political culture is the same one that The Forbes 400 has been dancing with for 33 years. And the history of his net worth fixation opens windows into Trump the entrepreneur, the candidate and the person....>Trump has measured himself by lining up assets against liabilities for his entire adult life. In his 1987 bestseller, The Art of the Deal, he recalled his net worth when he graduated from college (\"perhaps $200,000,\" probably the only time he ever low-balled his stash), publicly memorializing a benchmark for measuring his future success.>He added three and almost four zeroes to that figure during the 1980s as a tabloid caricature. As \"The Donald\" he honed the art of net worth lobbying. Financial summaries would arrive at the FORBES offices, often on gilded Trump-embossed letterheads for extra pop. \"We soon learned to take the number he threw out to us for his net worth, immediately divide it by three and refine it from there,\" remembers Harold Seneker, who ran The Forbes 400 for the first 15 years of its existence. And, indeed, the \"divide by three\" rule seemed to hold throughout the 1980s, including 1988, when we pegged him at an even $1 billion. The Donald, not content with his new billionaire status, countered with $3.74 billion.>As the years went on, Trump adopted a more personal touch, via phone calls and lunches, enlisting his longtime CFO, Allen Weisselberg, in the process. Good with names and dishing out tidbits like candy, Trump can be quite charming. The first time I interviewed him for FORBES, more than 20 years ago, he called me from a hospital waiting room. His second wife, Marla Maples, had just given birth to a daughter--Tiffany, he confided.>Trump's motivations for inflating his net worth were partially driven by dollars and cents. \"It was good for financing,\" Trump now acknowledges, echoing what other developers have told us over the years: that slapping a high Forbes 400 estimate on a banker's desk can sometimes help secure bigger loans and better rates. When I was a $27,000-a-year cub reporter on The Forbes 400, the largest strip-mall developer in Texas, the late Jerry J. Moore, offered me a six-figure p.r. job \"with lots of golf\" if I would only nudge his number closer to billionaire status.>Inside The Epic Fantasy That's Driven Donald Trump For 33 Yearshttps://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2015/09/29/inside-the-epic-fantasy-thats-driven-donald-trump-for-33-years/#4eea85882037And another great Randall Lane article on Trump, an interview with more insights into his narcissism and what makes him tickhttps://www.forbes.com/donald-trump/exclusive-interview/#73e9b002bdec", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 27513, "stickied": false, "score": 2177, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 19:55:37 2017", "ups": 2177}, {"body": "\"Let me tell you...Forbes is a failing newspaper.

He was the one in overalls, his wife ran the office.Oh Suk Kwon, who left South Korea for America in 1976, served as a fleet mechanic in the U.S. Army. After four years in the military, decades of working in an electrical plant and as an auto mechanic, after raising the kids and seeing them off to their adult lives, Kwon finally bought a gas station in Ellicott City in 2007. It meant everything to him.Just a few years after he opened it, zealous government investigators fishing for criminals seized all of the station\u2019s money on a hunch \u2014 and wiped the family out.No, they weren\u2019t money launderers or terrorists or mobsters or tax evaders. The government found no evidence of criminal activity.But after the investigation ended, after the gas station went under, and Kwon\u2019s wife died amid the stress of it all, after he moved from his neighborhood in shame and the Internal Revenue Service changed its policy so no other small business would get steamrolled this way \u2014 the agency won\u2019t give Kwon his money back.That\u2019s $59,117.47 the IRS is holding on to.As recently as August \u2014 the last time Kwon, now 73, asked for his money back \u2014 the IRS said no.He\u2019s heartbroken that the country he loves is treating him this way.Kwon was 32 when he came to the United States with his wife, son and daughter. He immediately enlisted in the Army. \u201cWhen I came to the United States, I had to do something for the country,\u201d said Kwon, who became a U.S. citizen.After four years and an honorable discharge, he built his life as a solid American. \u201cMy whole life was work, work, work,\u201d he said.His nightmare began in 2011, when he found federal agents on his doorstep. They accused him of \u201cstructuring\u201d \u2014 depositing money in increments of less than $10,000.A 1970 law called the Bank Secrecy Act requires banks to report any transactions bigger than $10,000. This is why terrorist groups, organized crime, money launderers, tax cheats and other bad hombres deposit their cash in chunks less than $10,000. And it\u2019s why banks are supposed to report people who make lots of cash deposits in smaller amounts, because it looks like they\u2019re structuring their deposits to evade scrutiny.These deposits are a crime only if they are done with the intention of staying beneath the radar. So the government has to know what\u2019s in your heart to charge you. In lots of cases, the bank deposits are a trail of bread crumbs leading to bigger crimes.That simply wasn\u2019t the case with Kwon. He paid all his taxes, reported what had to be reported.\u201cOf all the cases I have worked on, this one stands out for me,\u201d said attorney Edward Griffin, who is now fighting to help Kwon get his money back. \u201c I firmly believe that the government did wrong in choosing to prosecute Mr. Kwon and seize his assets. There was no good policy purpose for the prosecution. They did it for money, and they destroyed a good and honest man. It is shameful. Which is why I am still fighting for him.\u201dThe IRS wouldn\u2019t comment on Kwon\u2019s specific case, but a spokesman noted that he pleaded guilty to the structuring charge.When Kwon opened the gas station for business a decade ago, the teller at his local bank told him that deposits larger than $10,000 require a lot of paperwork, so she suggested he deposit less cash, but more frequently, he told me.So he did that. This is all he was guilty of. Lots of other small-business owners operate the same way.But around 2011, fervent investigations targeted scores of small businesses in Maryland. The best known of these was South Mountain Creamery, the Maryland farm that delivers eggs, dairy and produce to doorsteps throughout the D.C. area.When the creamery was accused of structuring \u2014 farmer Randy Sowers also said his bank teller told him to keep the deposits under $10,000 to cut paperwork \u2014 the farm\u2019s entire operating budget was seized.The government eventually found out that the cows weren\u2019t drug mules and the chickens weren\u2019t gangsters and allowed Sowers to sign a settlement agreement to get back half of about $60,000 that the IRS took. Sowers did it because he needed that money to keep the farm going.Another Maryland farmer, Calvin Taylor, had about $90,000 seized in 2011 after the government snagged him in a similar investigation. He couldn\u2019t take the time to fight the charge, either, and agreed to a settlement where the government returned about $41,000.Kwon went one step further, pleading guilty to the technicality of a structuring charge. Yes, he repeatedly deposited less than $10,000 cash, he reasoned. And yes, he did it to avoid paperwork. But the courts didn\u2019t see what was missing in his heart \u2014 criminal intent.The guilty plea killed his business, and he watched helplessly as his wife battled cancer and died. He still thinks her death was hastened by their legal troubles.The farmers didn\u2019t walk away from the fight. Backed by the libertarian Institute for Justice, Sowers, Taylor and others testified before Congress, petitioned and fought for three years to get their cash back. The IRS changed its guidelines in 2014, saying it would seize assets that came only from criminal activity. And less than a year later, the Justice Department announced it would follow suit.That should mean that Kwon gets his money back too, right?Wrong.Griffin petitioned the IRS and Department of Justice again this summer, citing the 2014 change and Kwon\u2019s clean record.But Kwon \u201chas not provided any additional information\u201d in his case, wrote Claiborne Porter, the Justice Department\u2019s acting principal deputy chief of money laundering and asset recovery, in the latest response to his remission request.Even if the IRS finally returned his $59,117.47, Kwon said the damage can never be undone.It wouldn\u2019t get him his gas station back, it wouldn\u2019t bring his wife back and it wouldn\u2019t get him his honor back.He was shamed, he said, when his neighbors were interviewed during the investigation.\u201cThey saw me as Korean. As a veteran,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were surprised to see me as a criminal. I will never forget that.\u201d", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 3912, "stickied": false, "score": 859, "submission_time": "Tue Oct 17 14:21:47 2017", "ups": 859}, {"body": "And nobody goes after the banks for having tellers that don't want to do that extra paperwork?
