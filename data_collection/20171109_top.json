What can be said, however, is that during several years of unremitting horror, she lost her mother, her older sister, and her younger brother, along with thousands upon thousands of neighbors, friends, and extended family, as the Novogrudok ghetto was whittled from roughly 30,000 Jews to 350. The only way she, her father, and her younger sister managed to survive was by escaping from the ghetto in 1943 through a hand-dug tunnel\u2014one through which all the remaining Jews attempted to crawl to freedom. Many didn\u2019t survive once they made it to the other side, but, miraculously, Kushner, her father, and her sister did\u2014and were eventually rescued by the legendary Jewish partisan Tuvia Bielski. For a year, they lived in the forest with Bielski\u2019s brigade of more than 1,000 Jews until, in the spring of 1944, \u201che brought us out from the woods.\u201d Novogrudok had been liberated by the Soviets.>In the Hollywood version of Kushner\u2019s story, this is almost certainly where it would end: with liberation.

But they again faced the problem that had thwarted them a decade earlier when, sensing the rising threat of anti-Semitism, they had contemplated leaving Novogrudok. \u201cNobody opened the door for us,\u201d Kushner recalled. \u201cNobody wanted to take us in.\u201d", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 76463, "comment_id": "dpkwhhz", "score": 26, "submission_time": "Thu Nov  9 20:33:10 2017", "ups": 26}, {"body": "Is there a list of companies that advertise on Fox News?", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 128202, "comment_id": "dpksery", "score": 22, "submission_time": "Thu Nov  9 19:23:53 2017", "ups": 22}, {"body": "The campaign of protests and boycotts against Fox/ Fox News sponsors need to be redoubled.

The costs aren't even the biggest problem. We've been at war too long. It lowers our effectiveness if something big really does happen.The wars haven't been very effective AND we haven't really taken care of our soldiers like we should. We should have never projected so much force into the middle east in the first place. We could have easily subsidized the shale market for decades with that money and crushed them economically from our livings rooms.Some HD bombing campaigns would have been enough to appease the masses. The idea we were going to invest all that money to build a better Middle East was idiotic. The US has more shale oil reserves than the entire world crude supply combined. Their oil is cheaper, so we want that first and extract enough shale to keep the price of crude down. We could ramp it up and be the worlds top oil producer if we wanted. We can supply Europe with it's gas too. LNG (liquefied natural gas) from the US is reasonable stop gap option while everything goes renewable. We would rather everyone else uses up their cheaper to extract and more local fuels at affordable levels while transitioning to renewables, but if you make us take over the world energy markets... we might!Yet another reason to stop using fossil fuels. To spite the American Capitalist Pigs ;)I don't care which way it goes. I get cheap gas or electric cars and high wages.. well unless I'm one of the people that don't get high wages and even then US poor is like global upper middle class. Even more than higher wages I think we need affordable living. It seems like a lot of people can afford decent retail goods and even cars, but not housing and perhaps heating/electric.A green/affordable housing initiative would be perfect for the US. That and Medicare for All and subsidized/free college, because it's 2017. The world is getting more complex, if you don't get educated you might be screwed. I also think professional certifications and training in emerging fields like solar installation and perhaps smart home design/install is reasonable for people who just aren't going to go to college.It's important to have a job creation vision too. That's actually the most important part that creates happy and loyal voters. A green/smart housing initiative would be perfect. It makes sense to tear down some of these less efficient and less desirable homes and build efficient ones, and employ people, and take stress off the grid and push American workers to do something innovative. We should have highly insulated houses designed around low heating and cooling costs. It doesn't matter if the world goes solar or gas or nuclear, it's all going to cost money and increasing efficiency is the way to battle that. Especially with people always wanting bigger and bigger homes.The bigger the home the higher energy rating they should have to have, at least. Insulation is cheap, unlike sprinklers or many other mandatory code requirements some counties have. A little bit of smart design to make room for the insulation and proper sealant and homes would be WAY more energy efficient, like boarder line unbelievably better. It's ridiculous we spend so much on utilities and so little on efficient design. We should stop that. It would make the country stronger, smarter and richer. Who the heck doesn't want that!

There is a whole industry for snooping and reselling data. Here are some examples.There are several SDKs (software development kits) that offer fingerprinting identity services. Meaning, when someone opens your app, it checks their device ID, IP address, GPS location, email address, etc. and makes a match to an identity. You then use this SDK to track their behavior in your app, such as purchases, interests, demographics, preferences, etc. This data is stored along with all the other apps that use the SDK. Now as an upsell, I can buy all of your behavior data from every other app that uses the same service. From the moment you install the app I know everything about you.There are SDKs that don\u2019t even offer a service, they just straight up pay the app maker to let their agent sit and collect data and send it up to their servers. Mostly location data.My favorite is there\u2019s an SDK that actually records the screen while you use the app, and the video gets sent up to the server for the app maker to see how you use their app in real time. It also tracks all of your views, swipes, and button presses tied to the video for analytics.Basically, you should assume that every moment you are using an internet connected device, you are being observed, scrutinized, and analyzed so that someone can sell you more shit.They are *really* good at this, and getting better every year. You think Facebook is listening to your microphone to serve you ads at the moment you are discussing a product? They don\u2019t need to. They know you *that* well.Edit: A lot of people are asking for specific examples of this monitoring tech. There are a ton of small players. So an example of location tracking is [Tamoco](https://www.tamoco.com/). An example of behavior tracking is [Branch.io](https://branch.io/) (they don't advertise the data mining, but it's a back-end deal). And session monitoring is [AppSee](https://www.appsee.com/) or [HotJar](https://www.hotjar.com/). There are many more that I haven't heard of.There are a ton of data resellers out there. They're typically small startups who buy and sell data, and they compete on having the most comprehensive and clean data sets. We get approached by a data reseller maybe once a month, either trying to buy our data or sell us data.Edit: A lot of people are flippant about this idea because you \"don't click on ads\" or you \"don't buy anything\". There are people who aren't interested in just selling you products. How about voting for a particular political candidate, or for/against a ballot measure? How about selling you a particular world view?

A scarce resource is not a model for a currency, it's a model for a commodity such as gold. Gold is not a currency, it is a commodity. Cryptocurrencies based on BitCoin are fundamentally based on analogies with gold rather than addressing the role of currency in an economy. In other words, they are virtual gold: they are scarce by design. That is useless for anything other than speculation. Look at the word \"currency\", it is about flow, movement, exchange as in a river current or an ocean current. In fact, we even extend this analogy to include other telltale signal words like \"liquidity\" and the \"flow\"or \"velocity\" of money. How hard is it to understand that the concept of currency is about exchange and not about hoarding, stockpiling, collecting, saving which is the opposite of the function of a currency? I find it curious that someone who would put so much effort into BitTorrent which is about sharing and encouraging low friction flows of information between individuals would then turn around and get excited about a software that does precisely the opposite and acts as an analogy to scarce physical resources when no scarcity actually exists by encouraging hoarding. To get a sense of why Bitcoin derived e-currencies are missing the point, check out the St. Louis Federal Reserve's charts on the velocity of money in the M2 money supply. The problem is not finding a new way to hoard money. There are myriad ways to hoard resources already. The problem is finding a way to increase the velocity of the currency. E-currency promises an array of methods to do this but they're getting none of the attention because of the obsession with hoarding. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2VEDIT: And I have to add, especially for those who have seen Adam Curtis' documentary \"Hypernormalization\", that this is a good example of why it's naive to expect real change from the techno utopians of Silicon Valley. The scam factor is way too high. It's a casino mentality and you can't really address the proper function of a currency in society if you want to insist that it all has to be held to the level of a casino. It doesn't have to be like that. The economy is not just a casino. It's a system that has very real effects on society. It's about relations of power and sex. It's about submission and domination. It's about the nature of society.

Making easy money on bitcoin doesn't do much for you. You will almost certainly just blow your returns. You can't KEEP money in bitcoin, it's not even close to safe to do that. Bitcoin is only for a small fraction of active investor types and even most of them are probably going to lose much of their existing money. You can be sure Putin is all over bitcoin and as that reality unfolds nations are likely to get rid of open currencies. Nobody is going to want a sanction proof currency except the nations that get sanctions put on them all the time. In time the nations of the world will not want to leave this massive door open. The larger the bitcoin market cap gets, the more likely they are to act against it. We've always known that.Bitcoin is a high risk high return investment. Stocks are a low risk low return investment. The big difference is that stocks are proven as a long term investment and bitcoin absolutely is not. You'd have to be a fool to think bitcoin is in it for the long term. There are so many better existing methods for money transfer that are being used in the wild and have been for years. People are just clueless. Bitcoin is a way to launder money and buy illegal items. It doesn't have a true place in the mainstream world of currency. It's like the beanie babies of online payment services. Just imagine this. You have all these bitcoins.. and your government say NOPE and blocks the bitchain. Bitcoin has ZERO contingency plan for when countries and ISPs block it. It never went through any legit process of being accepted, so basically bitcoin is ok until banks don't like it, at which point they will have no problem making it illegal or simply too hard to be useful to most people.That doesn't mean you can buy and sell it, it means it's never going to be a currency. It's slow, it has a lot better and bigger competition, it's not really secure, it's not really private and it relies heavily on internet and some level of computer savvy. There downsides are huge and because of that it should be entirely obvious to people that this is a trend, not a new global currency sweeping the world.With bitcoin you should get in and get out and repeat while DIVERSIFYING your investments into lower risks things like stocks and real estate. You should never store money in bitcoin for the long term like you would in stocks.So.. yeah.. anyone who thinks their money is better in bitcoin that stocks probably have no idea what they are talking about AND that means they would put their money in bitcoin, forget about it and probably fail to sell and buy at the right times. It's also even less legit than stocks. Stocks represent something real, bitcoin really doesn't. The value of bitcoin is mostly in the endless up and down trading and trends, not in anything with real substance or value.As I've said, it's not a fast, secure or private payment system. It's not even good at what it was supposedly made to do, be a digital currency. It's only really good at being a way to dodge taxes, buy illegal goods and launder money. You also bring potential money laundering attention to yourself if you deal in bitcoin a lot.I've made a few thousand on currencies, they are just things you buy and sell. They are not real currencies and never will be. They generally horrible to use as actual currencies. It's not insured or fraud protected in any way either.
