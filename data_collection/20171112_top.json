Menetap was involved in a huge money laundering scandal that unfolded from the mid 1990s onwards. \"Group Menatep Limited\" had an indirect controlling interest in Yukos Oil Company. According to Congressional testimony, Bank Menatep started as a front for Russian money-laundering and was reportedly controlled by the KGB. Khodorkovsky was found guilty of fraud by the Russians in 2004 and was jailed.    *  In 2003 he became Director General and Chairman of the Board for Neftyanoy Concern. In 2005, Neftyanoy bank was charged with money laundering and its CEO, Igor Linshits, eventually fled the country. Milner was not charged by Russian authorities with any wrongdoing. * In 2005, immediately after Neftyanoy Concern, he started Digital Sky Technologies (DST). * In May 2009 Yuri Milner was promoted to a Presidential commission (May 15). On May 26,  he closed his first $200 million investment in Facebook. Six months later, as he continued to make investments in U.S. social media companies, he was appointed to an almost yearlong project by the Ministry of Communication and Information to analyze the scale and distribution of illegal content on Runet, which referred to Russian-language web properties. * In April 2010, DST buys chat service ICQ from AOL and receives $300 million investment from Tencent (China). In August, 2010 Milner is appointed to serve on the Government Commission on High Technology, which is chaired by President Putin. * The interesting thing about Milner is that the biographies he publishes rarely contain any information about his activities on behalf of the Russian Govt, nor do they cover his time at Neftyanoy or Menatep. It is unclear how how he managed to avoid beinginvestigated or charged when the other principals at both firms were found guilty and jailed.

Just four years after his predecessor Mitt Romney declared Russia to be Washington\u2019s greatest geopolitical threat, Trump has praised President Vladimir Putin as a real leader, \u201cunlike what we have in this country.\u201d Trump has also dismissed reports that Putin has murdered political enemies (\u201cOur country does plenty of killing also,\u201d he told MSNBC), suggested that he would \u201clook into\u201d recognizing Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula and questioned whether the United States should defend NATO allies who don\u2019t pay their way. When Russian hackers stole a cache of emails in July from the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers, as security analysts have shown, Trump called on \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d to hack some more.>\u201cTrump is breaking with Republican foreign doctrine and almost every Republican foreign thinker I know,\u201d says Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. \u201cHe is departing radically from Ronald Reagan, something never done by any Republican Party presidential candidate.\u201d    > * August, 2016  [**Donald Trump, useful idiot. - Slate**](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/donald_trump_useful_idiot.html)    >Trump isn\u2019t a Russian agent. He\u2019s what communists once called a useful idiot: a na\u00efve, easily manipulated spouter of ideas that serve foreign interests. He enjoys Vladimir Putin\u2019s flattery and serves Putin\u2019s interests by weakening NATO and defending Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea. Trump also serves the interests of ISIS and al-Qaida by framing the struggle against them as a battle between the West and Islam. On Wednesday, at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi, Trump and Nigel Farage, the chief promoter of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, congratulated one another for breaking the shackles of Western alliances.

Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump\u2019s vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated.>Mr. Putin is a great leader, Mr. Trump says, ignoring that he has killed and jailed journalists and political opponents, has invaded two of his neighbors and is driving his economy to ruin.

We have disagreed with one another on many issues, including the Iraq war and intervention in Syria.

Furthermore, his expansive view of how presidential power should be wielded against his detractors poses a distinct threat to civil liberty in the United States. Therefore, as committed and loyal Republicans, we are unable to support a Party ticket with Mr. Trump at its head.

First, Russia did interfere in the U.S. election.\"I'll take a stab at this first one, and not bother about the other two. It seems this claim is based on a couple things here. Firstly, it relies mostly on the release of the DNC emails, which are inaccurately described as 'hacked'. They were (as per the conclusion by Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity) as per the limited information made available about the supposed intrusion, impossible to have been remote based on the rate of data transfer. Instead, the data was transferred at a rate consistent with a flash drive. Somebody inside the DNC took that information, and Wikileaks got its hands on it, which is how we in the public all received that peek behind the curtain. Russian involvement in this revelation is dubious. Wikileaks denies that they obtained the information from anything related to Russia-- and last I checked, Wikileaks hasn't lied to me yet. Clapper, Brennan, the DNC, and the intelligence agencies have, on the other hand, lied to the public, on numerous occassions and subjects. And let's not forget, those DNC emails were a separate revelation from the private HRC server, which was a separate revelation that HRC hadn't turned those emails over to state in their entirety, which was separate from the revelation of the DNC never having turned its servers over for investigation by the FBI or the DHS despite claiming foreign intrusion... ...let's just say that emails were a longstanding issue in the 2016 election even without the DNC emails released by Wikileaks. There may be some water to the idea that the timing of yet another email scandal could not have been worse for HRC, but the timing of how the scandal played out was just as much the doing of James Comey as anybody else, with his bizzare series of public statements keeping the scandal fresh in voters minds.Also, I haven't heard any convincing denials on the content of the leaks. I have heard nothing substantive to indicate the Democratic Party did not in fact have a primary skewed and overseen by one of its candidates. I have not heard a great argument for why the private server was not, on its face, a greater breach of national security than a marine using gmail to notify his command of an imminent attack. That marine saw jail time. HRC lost an election on her own. Now there is an effort to distract people from the content of the revelations by casting aspersions on the source of the information. The second leg of his argument is that Russian propaganda efforts over the internet via trolls, social media, and RT, helped tilt the field in Trumps favor. I'd love to know HOW an odd assortment of comment trolls, $100,000 of facebook and twitter ads that look laughably childish (one of them features an arm wrestling match between satan and Jesus- it got under a hundred thumbs up), and a news organization analogous to Radio Free Europe with less viewership in the US than al Jazeera managed to defeat a candidate with over a billion dollars in her campaign chest, and an entire media establishment that treated her election like a coronation ceremony in its certitude. So no, I don't find that convincing, either. How else could Russia have manipulated the election? It was not through something that would actually matter, like vote tallies. Even the January DNI report is very firm in that conclusionTrump may indeed be a special kind of idiot. I've no love to lose for the moron in office. But this whole Russia scapegoating thing is ridiculous and dangerous. They are not the Soviet Union anymore. They have a GDP approximately the size of South Korea. They have a moribund economy that is overly dependent on exporting natural resources. They don't have a robust manufacturing sector beyond a few elite defense contractors and an alcohol industry. The entire population of Russia is below 150 million and declining. They are not the threat they are portrayed as, even if they don't roll over to US hegemony on every single plank of our own outrageous foreign policy.Don't make me agree with his orange-ness. Downvote these fake news stories so people will stop blaming a down on his luck member of the nuclear club. Oh, yeah. That's right. Russia could still, unlike every other adversary the US faces, end the fucking world. No need to make up bullshit just so we can burn it on their doorstep.

It has nothing to do with them thinking that the Russians colluding with Sanders is good; rather, it is because humans believe in guilt by association. If you are associated with a bad person, as Sanders supporters are, and then it turns out that person IS a bad person, you're likely to go into denial and defend them, because a threat to that person denigrates the whole tribe/social grouping. As such, regardless of the evidence, a good chunk of people will cleave more closely to an embattled member of their tribe out of sheer tribalism.On top of that, attacks on tribal members can often provoke displays of tribal unity, especially if they are of dubious provenance or have obvious political motives behind them. In other words, many of these people may feel that the allegations are false, that the source is unreliable, or that they are being blown out of proportion to the reality, and thus feel the reverse reaction to what people might otherwise expect - instead of liking the person less, they like them more, because they are being attacked by EVIL OUTSIDERS who are trying to bring down the tribe.This was what sparked the start of GamerGate. Zoe Quinn's boyfriend made a post about how she had betrayed the principles of Social Justice and should be cast out of the tribe as a result. In the Social Justice community, cheating on someone is equivalent to rape, because you are exposing them involuntarily to STDs carried by some third party, and moreover, sleeping with people like your boss is a violation of social justice principles because it normalizes employers sleeping with employees and employees trying to trade sex for jobs/promotions. Moreover, she actually spread doxx of people *during* the whole GamerGate thing.Did any of this make the social justice community turn away from her? No. Why? Same reason. If another member of their tribe is a hypocrite, why, that might imply that they themselves are a hypocrite! Moreover, those evil nasty outsiders clearly are being totally unfair, and are all bad people who are trying to bring down the tribe. Better defend members of the tribe, no matter whether or not their behavior was okay.And this is actually logical behavior to some extent - if it comes out in the public sphere that members of your group are, in fact, not very good people, that does reflect negatively on the tribe and damage its prestige. A member of the social justice community spreading doxx is pretty much the same thing as a Catholic priest diddling children - people who are supposed to be standing up for the downtrodden are instead perpetrating the very behavior they should be fighting against. In both cases it makes the tribe look like a bunch of hypocrites and damages their moral standing in the public eye, thereby diminishing the prestige of being a member of the tribe. It is not surprising that people stand up against such attacks as as they, to some extent, an attack on *them* as well due to human minds inherently suggesting that if someone is a member of a group which has disreputable members, that person must themselves be disreputable.But this is hardly restricted to political extremes; it is normal, mainstream human behavior.Remember Bill Clinton's sex scandal? His approval rating among the public actually went *up* during that whole thing, because he was seen as being unfairly persecuted by members of an opposing tribe. Is that really a logical reaction to finding out he lied about having sex with Monica Lewinsky? No, of course not. And yet, it happened.This happens constantly.I know that a lot of you want to demonize the evangelicals for this, but the reality is that it is a natural human impulse - one you yourself are subject to. If you want to call them out for falling into tribalistic behavior, that's fine...But just remember that you yourself probably engage in the same behavior, so you should keep an eye out on yourself as well. It is very easy to feel as if you must defend someone who is a member of your tribe.They aren't acting this way because they approve of people molesting 14 year old girls.

OTOH everyone who campaigned openly for/against Brexit did it because it benefitted someone (even themselves), not because they wanted just to destroy the EU.Putin likely campaigned for both sides of Brexit, because a very high secondary goal is to increase divisiveness between peoples, ultimately to weaken democracies/nations, by making them function and undermine debate.He does this by trolling, raising the heckles of both sides so they don't listen to each other, causing outrage on both sides, turning everyone against everyone.Incidentally, what he is doing (although not necessarily a goal in itself) is raising the amount of suffering, distrust, anger in the world.Basically he's a big dick.I mean considering his end goals, his means of getting there are setting out to create as much division as he can, while fucking his own country and people so badly (not intentionally perhaps, he's just such a poor governor/economist that Russia has gone nowhere. He should have delegated the economy to technocrats and focused on the only thing he's good at = intelligence/manipulation/creating suffering)He also did not campaign openly, which a lot of other nations who tried to influence Brexit elections did do. While US/Germany/RoW gave their own opinions, it would be surprising if they created fake personas/communities etc and trolled the Internet.Any money spent on \"legitimate\" advertising insofar as that's not an oxymoron, should have been on one side of the issue, and not in a trolling way that's just going to piss people off with zero substance.Nb if I'm wrong about that, and evidence one day does appear that other nations are anything remotely similar, then let's get pissed off with them at that future hypothetical date ; for now; the only country who has been caught red-handed is Russia, and given risk/reward wrt reputation, Russia is the only country who would bother with such a campaign imho because they have no reputation to lose. Now they have been caught, what's going to happen? Hmmm, oh it's just Putin being Putin, shucks.So there is a huge difference in how everyone has tried to influence elections.

I don\u2019t exist. 6. Go to my parents social media, I\u2019m not there. Go visit their home, I\u2019m not in any pictures or photographs. They\u2019ve wiped and erased me. We do not have a normal family relationship. Did they every congratulate me on my acceptance into Grad School? Never. My father will go to lunch with my husband BUT NOT ME. This is not regular.

Everything out of Trump is showing us that he is planning a preemptive strike on North Korea. That is exactly what Trump wants everyone to think.

He said that he won't say what hes going to do and give them warning he will just attack so they don't know whats coming. Thats why engaging in a war of worlds against North Korea makes no sense if he really is planning to attack them.The US military as it stands cannot fight multiple big wars in multiple theaters. The situation in the Middle East with \"precious\" Israel is the US's priority. Hezbollah and thus Iran is now on Syria's border with Israel. With the civil war in Syria winding down in all Syria,Russia,Iran,Hezbollah are on the ground inside Syria staring at Israel's border. Israel sees them all as a threat and has been instigating Saudi Arabia to start a war with Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The US cannot now start a war in the Pacific with North Korea that would use up all of her military resources and would require millions of US troops which would necessitate the re instituting the draft as it would leave Israel vulnerable to her enemies. Indeed if the US was engaged in a large scale war it would be foolish of Iran,Syria and Hezbollah would not take the opportunity that Israel's big protector is busy and not attack Israel.This is why Trump has made North Korea such a big issue because he is trying to fool the world that he will strike North Korea when instead the 3 Carriers will head west and join Israel and Saudi Arabia in a war against Syria,Lebanon and Iran.
