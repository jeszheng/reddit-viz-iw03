He was a monster and, even with Trump succeeding Obama, will go down in history as one of our worst presidents and a horrible human being. His primary campaign against John McCain, particularly in South Carolina, featured a deeply racist insinuation that McCain had fathered an illegitimate black child. He ignored serious voting irregularities during his election to the presidency, without investigating how it is that he won. He was deeply negligent prior to 9/11, brushing off his duty to read, analyze, and act on intelligence briefings, ignoring warnings from the previous administration and his own intelligence officers, and opting to go on an unprecedented number of vacations. He was also in the early process of trying to pass prescription drug coverage without any possible way to pay for it at the same time he wanted to pass a huge tax break for wealthy Americans. The worst intelligence failure in history led to the worst terrorist attack in US history, all under Bush. After that, Bush took a stance of defiance and vengeance, squandering the world's empathy at our terrible loss. He immediately got the US involved in the Afghani civil war between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. We bombed Taliban training camps despite the fact that al Qaeda and the Taliban were not the same organization. The Taliban said that if the US stopped bombing their training camps, they would turn over bin Laden. This offer was not even considered. Apparently dissatisfied with getting the US into one endless war in the Middle East, Bush and his cronies started a smear campaign of lies against Iraq culminating in the US committing to a war of aggression based on lies. Back at home, the Patriot Act, a massive warrantless wiretapping and eavesdropping apparatus, and media-collusion campaigns were launched, none of which were really ever designed to deal with the threat of terror, but rather which violated liberties and sought to control the domestic population. The US, a signatory to the Geneva Conventions, began a terror campaign of kidnapping individuals in countries without contact with governments, renditioning these kidnapping victims to secret black sites, and ***actually engaging in torture***. The US tortured prisoners, as policy. And we tried civilians and terrorists in military trials based on secret evidence. Bush was so busy turning being a victim of a terrorist attack into an excuse to become an evil empire that he was negligent back at home, and when Katrina hit his incompetent head of FEMA dropped the ball. Trump is already one of the worst presidents in history, from his terribly embarrassing campaign to his admitting to sexual assault (and probably raping at least his ex wife) to his terrible racism and xenophobia to his Muslim ban to his unprecedented ignorance and ineptitude to his Twitter and Fox and Friends addictions... but the worst president in US history is still George W. Bush. If Mueller's investigation leads to Trump being impeached and removed from office soon, Bush will remain the worst president. That he is not rotting in a prison cell is one of the worst injustices in the last 30 years of the United States.

Sources with links to the intelligence community say it is believed that Carter Page went to Moscow in early July carrying with him a pre-recorded tape of Donald Trump offering to change American policy if he were to be elected, to make it more favorable to Putin. In exchange, Page was authorized directly by Trump to request the help of the Russian government in hacking the election.On November 7th I reported that the FBI had been granted a FISA warrant to investigate the activities of two Russian banks, Alfa Bank and Silicoln Valley Bank. I also reported that an earlier attempt to obtain a FISA warrant, in June, had failed in the court because it named Donald Trump himself and three of his associates. In an exclusive at Patribotics, I reported that these named associates were Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Boris Epshteyn.Sources close to the intelligence community now report that this application was made because a recording exists of all three men discussing the possibility of Page taking the tape of Trump to Moscow as an earnest of good faith. (Update: Mr. Epshteyn has denied he is on any such recording, but I am not sure if he is denying the conversation took place and have asked his lawyers to clarify). There is a minor dispute over whether Trump himself is also on that tape, as well as the tape that was delivered to Moscow by Carter Page of Trump making this promise. A separate source with links to the intelligence community reported to me several months ago that Boris Epshteyn, alone of the four men named in the first FISA application, is an actual FSB agent (he has strenuously denied this). Paul Manafort is registering as an agent of a foreign power [update: he has yet to do so]; Carter Page has admitted, from public reporting, to have met with Russian intelligence agents.It may therefore be surmised that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn, in this conversation wherein they discussed taking the Trump tape to Moscow, were all acting in concert as agents of the Russian state first and foremost, and Trump staffers second. Because the provision of such a tape to Putin would clearly be the ultimate in kompromat on a future American President (far worse than any sexual blackmail tape).The FISC judge, as I reported, rejected that application, made in June. Director Comey likely proved to the satisfaction of the court that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn were acting as Russian agents. But he may have felt that Trump, by now the nominee, was just a very stupid patsy. And the planned trip had not taken place.Director Comey redrew this request and presented FISC with a new warrant application. The Washington Post says that there is a FISA warrant on Page, but it does not say that there is NOT a FISA warrant on the other two men named in the June application. I will therefore assume from now on that the July FISA warrant granted targets Page, Manafort and Epshteyn.Page had always seemed weirdly confident about his relationship with Trump. He had the tape of Mr. Trump offering to change policy. Sources say that this tape was played in meetings with Russian intelligence officers in Moscow, and that several Western intelligence sources have recordings of the meetings and the tape which they supplied to US intelligence.The Washington Post does not name the date in July when Director Comey obtained his warrant. It seems likely however that it would not have been before July 5-8, when Page was in Russia. Furthermore, my own story on the separate FISA warrant granted on the two Russian banks states that Director Comey specifically sought permission to examine existing transcripts and intercepts on US persons as they related to this inquiry into money laundering into the Trump campaign.My November 7th report directly connects the granting of the banking warrant to election hacking of the DNC. It is fair to say that, at the time of writing, I did not understand precisely how these two matters were connected. I now know and have reported that the server was washing databases of DNC hacked materials with voter registration materials. It is clear that, if my sources were correct, Director Comey would not have been able to listen to the recording of Mr. Trump played by Mr. Page in the offices of Russian intelligence in Moscow until he obtained that warrant, in October; his July warrant on Page came too late to affect a trip on July 5-7th.When Carter Page returned to the RNC in Cleveland, he and Jeff Sessions, who recruited him to Team Trump via the Alfa Bank lobbyist Richard Burt, both met with the Russian spymaster Sergei Kislyak. From public reporting, we know that they not only changed the RNC platform on Ukraine at the behest of Russia, but also discussed lifting sanctions, a violation of the Logan Act.Mr. Epshteyn was probably also present at that meeting. [Update \u2013 Mr. Epshteyn has issued a denial that he is an FSB agent, and has denied \u201cmeeting with Russian spymaster\u201d Sergei Kislyak, as I have described the Ambassador. It is unclear to me from the wording of the letter whether he is denying that he ever met with Mr. Kislyak, or that Mr. Kislyak is a spymaster; I am seeking clarification]. The reason I say this is that I can personally report that Mr. Epshteyn, whom I had met several times in the green room at Fox News, and I, had a bet on \u2013 I bet him $100 that the Republican Party would not actually nominate the racist and sexist Donald Trump.I lost that bet and made a point of texting Mr. Epshteyn at the conference to pay up. He was charming. I handed over the $100. He went back to Mr. Trump\u2019s private suite.I now realize that I was probably giving money directly to an agent of Russia (at Mr. Epshteyn\u2019s request, I have changed this from \u201can FSB agent\u201d. Mr. Epshteyn has not yet  clarified for me if he is an agent of Russia under FARA, so I am altering the text pending his answer). But if I could not hear what Mr. Page, Mr. Manafort, and Mr. Kislyak were discussing with the Russian Ambassador behind the door of Donald Trump\u2019s suite, the FBI most certainly could.I will produce a short timeline of the Trump-Russia story on this blog tomorrow. For now, the point is that intelligence sources say that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn, possibly also with Trump, are on tape discussing how Page should carry a recording of Donald Trump to Moscow, offering his bona fides in exchange for Russia\u2019s help hacking the election (something that Epshteyn denies, specifically, he denies that he is on tape doing so \u2013 I have sought clarification as to whether the conversation happened, and will amend the text when I receive an answer); and that the said tape of Trump was played by Page to Russian intelligence, possibly including Mr. Diveykin, the Russian official in charge of hacking the election; and that multiple foreign intelligence services, among them the UK, Germany and Ukraine, have a tape of this; and that finally, in October, the FBI was able to listen to that tape.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 92, "comment_id": "dpbfp66", "score": 3, "submission_time": "Sat Nov  4 02:17:38 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "none of this would have happened if Trump didnt hire Michael FlynnThanks Obama ", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 27, "comment_id": "dpbseia", "score": 0, "submission_time": "Sat Nov  4 08:27:37 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "> \u201cI had a very brief hello to a couple of people.

Still a big concern though, and certainly not great if someone hops on a plane with it (chances of that decrease as numbers get lower, and more people are treated) but they've managed to bring infected numbers back down, and plague problems are something Madagascar has annually anyway so there's no reason this can't be brought under control.

So the 600 refuse to leave to the new camp for fear of their lives. Instead of sticking around till the issue is resolved.

So Kevin Spacey is getting a lot of accusations even though we still don't know whether they are false or authentic *(though Spacey admitted with one person but finding accurate proof is often hard when it comes to sexual harassment or rape)*, he is getting a lot of negative attention and nobody wants to work with him anymore.But when there was an audio file of Trump saying \"grab her by the pussy\", he still became president.I'm sorry for sounding controversial but this baffles me______________ Yes, I know. I made a silly comparison between locker talk and someone who possibly actually sexually harassed someone.*(i got this response in another sub-thread)*But I wanted to say it becuase it baffles me. Put it this way. Imagine that there is someone who you really know well or who you really admire is contesting to be a politician or someone in a position of power. That person is meant to be a role model, meaning some things in their lives need to be altered or changed or even hindered. Yes, sexual attractions happen to everyone, it's a biological thing. Everyone loves sex.However, imagine that particular someone who talks about women *(or men)* by provoking sexually-motivated behaiours without consent or without asking them out for dinner first.You do not go to first base without getting to know the person first *(unless it is a hook-up or a prostitute)*.Considering that Trump mentioned this in a wildly sexually-motivated manner without mentioning about who the person is, what she likes, what are her hobbies and so on, this mildly implies that Trump sees women as sexual objects, a pressure that females are been objectified for generations.I don't know how Trump thinks or whether or not Trump really is someone who prefers to objectify women *(or any other person)* but given the fact that he was a presidential candidate and he is meant to represent in an entire country, that is a lot of responsibility. Like the saying goes \"with great power comes great responsibility\"I am not saying that he cannot have sexual attractions but the way he used his words with that sexual attraction is very objectifying as he is implying that he sees women as sexual toys.Now ... since he is now president, do you think that this is the kind of man that you want to look up to?        --------------That's what I wanted to imply.So far, there is not much evidence about the accusations against Spacey but the fact that Trump had a hidden conversation in a very provoking manner and still became president is a baffling thing.*(I am not saying that Spacey is innocent. Accusations, even when accusations are done by many people are meaningless without accurate proof even though they still have to be taken seriously. Then again, Spacey did admit for at least one)*Yes, I know. Sexual attractions happen to anyone and I know that many people talked in a wildly provoking manner in secret becuase this kind of talk is not anything new becuase sexual attractions exist.But the way Trump said it is like \"go right for the goal without consent\" which may imply that Trump sees women as sexual toys.This is the downside of politics. Anything personal must be hidden or silenced becuase politicians *(or any kind of leaders)* have to limit their own personal motivations or personal feelings. They have to appear as more than human becuase as leaders, people should look up to them.Again, I am not saying that cannot or should not have sexual attractions but how the worded out that phrase is just plain creepy, especially for women*(now imagine anyone saying the same, especially leaders who btw, can use their own power for their own self-interests, to either men or women)*    ", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 2274, "comment_id": "dpbxgig", "score": -1, "submission_time": "Sat Nov  4 12:39:38 2017", "ups": -1}, {"body": "Kevin Spacey hits on a little boy, doesn't actually do anything, and his career is ruined.

The problem is rampant. The main issue is the break down in power hierarchy between students and teachers (Anarchists go suck Koch's dick). Teachers have no social or institutional power, so the only way they could be successful is by getting closer to the students to try and win them over. They had to stoop down and try to become their peer and friend. That was the best way to be able to actually teach instead of yell at kids all day and have everyone hate their life.The moment I saw this, I was out. I had zero desire to be friends with any of my students. I was there to teach and mentor, and help them become strong and good people. It was not a surprise to hear the teacher that took over for me, got fired for fucking a student the year after I left. The reality is that teachers are pressured from all sides: students, parents, admins, and other teachers. They have to be popular to be seen as successful. This ends up driving teachers to lower themselves to the students level to try and be cool and well liked. The end result of that is that some teachers blur the social line between teacher and friend. And then blur the line between friend and intimacy.
