Sex is biological - but how do you want to define it? Genitals? Chromosomes? Hormone levels? These things don't always match up.Being more than one race is seen as pretty normal. Basically none of us are just one thing - we have ancestors from all over the place. Sex is seen as more binary where it's either male or female. The idea of being both is possible, but it's not socially acceptable - pretty much every day someone has a child born with both a penis and vulva and is told that they must immediately choose one. And that whole idea, of the parents choosing which gender their child will be, really kind of goes against the idea that sex or gender are innate, unchangeable things. With race, it's totally normal to mainly identify as one heritage - like my family says they're Irish, but if you analyze our DNA I'm sure there's a bunch of other shit in there too.So yeah, I guess I disagree with the question while thinking it's just not that simple.

Countries that have tied down their gun laws have significantly less gun related violence events. Australia is one of these countries. They haven't had a mass shooting since 1996. What about us? We've had 70 (give or take) mass shootings each with deaths of AT LEAST 3. Is that a coincidence? I don't think so. I understand that many of you have been shooting and collecting guns for a long time. You're responsible with your weapons, so we know you aren't going to be hurting others, but what about the people that will? They're getting weapons easily because of the current gun laws. Gun laws that aren't strict enough. And there are people that want to take from these laws even more. I guess the argument here is that we know many of you see shooting as a sport, we know that you can use it safely, and we also respect it.

Alot of very liberal people deeply underestimate the cultural identity that many communities have wrapped around guns. I don't think hunting rifles and very basic hand guns are things that would ever just be handed in, in the event of a gun drive like the one in Australia. It runs deeper than that. Alot of people also flippantly refer to this gun culture as a fear based, ego stroking culture that compensates for their small penis or something. This couldn't be further from the truth for alot of people.If we're ever going to pass real, rational *Gun Safety Laws* we have to start from a point of understanding and really acknowledge the gun culture in this country.

Countries that have tied down their gun laws have significantly less gun related violence events. Australia is one of these countries. They haven't had a mass shooting since 1996. What about us? We've had 70 (give or take) mass shootings each with deaths of AT LEAST 3. Is that a coincidence? I don't think so. I understand that many of you have been shooting and collecting guns for a long time. You're responsible with your weapons, so we know you aren't going to be hurting others, but what about the people that will? They're getting weapons easily because of the current gun laws. Gun laws that aren't strict enough. And there are people that want to take from these laws even more. I guess the argument here is that we know many of you see shooting as a sport, we know that you can use it safely, and we also respect it.

It can't force unlawful searches upon people.The bill of rights was intended to give the people protection against the possibility of a tyrannical government in the future.I know the gun control debate is a heated one, but when you're asking the government to take away someone's rights, that's nearly always a terrible idea.Only one constitutional amendment has ever TAKEN AWAY someone's rights (prohibition) and it was later repealed.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 10, "stickied": false, "score": 13, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 10:11:05 2017", "ups": 13}, {"body": "When the constitution was written, we had just fended off a tyrannical government.

A lot of the generally progressive, liberal ideas around order come from trying to maintain order when yo've got 5000 people in your apartment complex. A lot of the conservative ideas around order come from having to survive when emergency services are a few hours away. Guns find themselves in the middle of this whole thing. They were written into the Constitution at a time when we wanted to be sure to avoid a tyranical government. But beyond that, they mean very different things to different people. Out in the country, a gun is just another tool, like a hammer or screwdriver. People use it to hunt -- a perfectly normal activity that we've been doing as a species for a few million years. In the city, however, a gun is generally a danger and a liability -- any misfire or missed shot and the bullet is going to go through *someone's* apartment, possibly hitting them and landing you in jail. And it's less necessary when there's often people or cops nearby who can help in a dangerous situation. (Lots of exceptions and differing opinions on all this, obviously, but what I wrote is generally true on a high level.)So it's an honest debate. Is government tyranny still a threat?

Of course this is impossible to do today, with the most powerful military in the world having a few more advantages than better training and easier access to muskets, so it must be obsolete and no longer relevant. However, people who went out and settled the frontier relied heavily on guns to feed and protect their families. Because of this, guns in modern America represent independence and self-reliance. They're a symbol of freedom. Also, shooting sports are really fun and a lot of people invest a LOT of money into them.  So, when big city politicians start talking about stricter gun control regulations, gun owners don't get it.

This releases a ton of energy, but it's like trying to push the same pole of two magnets together.  You need to overcome the resistance first to get them to \"touch.\"This requires an enormous amount of energy.  The only way to really confine and squeeze the gas tightly enough to do this is via electromagnetic fields.  More specifically, confining it inside a magnetic coil, like a cylinder.  Usually, we then twist the cylinder back on itself to form a torus, and have the gas zoom around in circles inside the coil.But now you get into the problems:1) The amount of energy needed to drive the magnetic field is enormous, and the current will melt any standard conducting cable or metal.  The only thing that won't heat up when that amount of current goes through it is a superconductor.  There are no known room temperature superconductors, only those operating at very cold temperatures.  So you have to keep the entire thing constantly cooled with liquid nitrogen, and it's prone to break a lot.  The Large Hadron Collider has the same issue and has suffered some high profile breakages this way.2)  As the gas starts to collide and fuse, a plasma is formed.  But plasmas are highly conductive.  As the plasma zooms around, it starts to form its own electromagnetic current and fields, which start to mess with the fields you're using to try and contain it.  This is extremely difficult to detect or model and very hard to adjust in the split-second time frames needed to keep it stable.  We're still figuring out the exact shape required to get the plasma's currents to self-contain in a nice stable way with the others.  So far we can only keep the plasma going for about 100 seconds at the very longest recorded.3)  Energy extraction.  We still haven't quite figured this part out yet.  All that energy in the plasma is \"real,\" but how do you get it out?  The only way we really know right now is using the heat to boil water and use the steam to drive turbines.  This is taken as a \"we'll do it easily once we get to that point,\" but we still aren't even to the point of stable long-standing plasmas so nobody's really invested much into it.  The good news is, we have gotten very close to getting more energy out of the reaction than we put in at this point, and next-gen reactors like ITER are expected to trounce this threshold pretty conclusively.  We know it's doable at scale, now.4)  Fusion is much safer than fission, and does not leave lots of crazy exotic radioactive isotopes everywhere.  This is because most of the radioactivity is confined within the plasma and does not ionize the surrounding material.  However, fusion does produce neutron radiation, which by having no charge, can't be contained that way.  These neutrons bombard the vessel walls and slowly break it down over time.  It's currently unknown how exactly we will avoid having to replace the entire reactor semi-frequently due to this, but like the above problem, it's considered a \"cross that bridge when we get to it\" issue that will be solved by some kind of new material.", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 19256, "stickied": false, "score": 11879, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 06:14:26 2017", "ups": 11879}, {"body": "Right now we have a few major issues:1. First Wall Problem: The fusion plasma needs a high product of density-temperature-confinement. Practical solutions almost always involve plasma at millions of degrees C. The plasma will also emit a lot of neutrons, assuming the mainstream D-T fuel approach. The layer of the reactor that faces the plasma is called the first wall, and in most fusion schemes it needs to have some pretty intense properties to survive.2. Simulation: Simulating a plasma is really hard. It has both fluid dynamics and electro-mechanics. This is called Magneto Hydro Dynamics (MHD), and it is a fairly good approximation of certain regimes of plasma operation. It is quite difficult to solve and simulate due to the nasty nature of the underlying equations. Fluid dynamics is very non-linear and chaotic, which is why it is hard to predict weather far into the future. There are many different code bases used to simulate MHD but as far as I know they all have their own major tradeoffs and there is no clear winner.3. Exotic hardware: most fusion schemes require expensive power supplies, since there is almost always a large amount of power involved in the process. The National Ignition Facility is a major fusion project and has 330MJ of capacitors that pulse into flash lamps which fire massive lasers at a tiny pellet of DT fuel. This capacitor bank is billions of dollars, and takes up several football fields.

Part of this waylaid by the fact that plasma research has been extensively gutted, below the point where researchers said \"if we get only this much money, we'll never achieve it.\"ITER, when it's finally done, will at least produce more power than it consumes, but it won't be economical to sell.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 398880, "stickied": false, "score": 148, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 06:11:42 2017", "ups": 148}, {"body": "I didn't understand why fusion is difficult until I read a short article called \"[A Pint of the Sun](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast110_99/sunfire.html)\" by Joshua Barnes.  Here's the article in its entirety:> Descriptions of nuclear `burning' in stars sometimes give the impression that the central furnace of a star is a place of violent activity. In fact, the inside of a star is rather peaceful, and hydrogen burning goes on very slowly.> To appreciate this, imagine we had a magic transporter which could beam one pint of gas from the center of the Sun right into this room. One pint of water weighs one pound, but the center of the Sun has a density about 150 times the density of water, so a pint of sun-stuff weighs almost as much as I do.> Now the first thing that would happen is that this building would vanish in a huge explosion. When it was down these in the center of the Sun, the gas was compressed by the vast weight of all the thick layers of dense material above it, so it was under enormous pressure. When it's suddenly transported to Earth, the confining pressure is removed, and the gas expands -- very rapidly. The explosion would have the force of a small nuclear bomb.> So if we want to get this experiment approved by the University administration, we need to make a container which can hold our pint of sun-stuff under pressure without bursting apart. That's not easy to do, but we've already assumed we have a transporter right out of Star Trek, so a little more magic won't be noticed. But our troubles are not over, because this gas from the center of the sun is incredibly hot, and the heat would escape in the form of X-rays, cooking everyone in the vicinity.> OK, let's assume we can make the walls of our container perfectly reflective, so that all the escaping heat energy is reflected right back in. I said we were using magic, didn't I? So we have a pint of sun-stuff sitting right there in front of us, safe as can be. Now let's allow a little energy to escape -- just exactly the amount of energy being generated by nuclear reactions, so the gas stays at a constant temperature. We can use the escaping energy to run a generator and produce electricity. Thermonuclear power!> But before we call a press conference or make any big deals with HECO, we better figure out how much energy those bottled nuclear reactions are generating. And the answer is...> About a thousand times less energy than I'm generating by breathing. That's all! Per unit mass, the Sun produces much less energy than a living human body. In total, the Sun generates a lot of energy, but that's only because it's so massive. If I was as massive as Jupiter -- perish the thought -- I'd produce more energy than the Sun, just from my body heat.> Of course, the Sun produces energy by nuclear reactions, while I produce energy by chemical reactions. That's how the Sun can go on shining for ten billion years, whereas I get hungry every few hours.> The enormous lifetime of the Sun gives us another perspective on the same basic point, which is that nuclear reactions in stars are, for the most part, very slow and gentle. It takes about ten billion years for all the hydrogen in the center of the Sun to be burned to helium. That means that per year, a hydrogen nucleus has about one chance in ten billion of being involved in a nuclear reaction. The center of the Sun is an incredibly safe place for hydrogen nuclei! A hydrogen nucleus in the Sun runs much less risk of undergoing a nuclear reaction than I do of being hit by lightning.So why is fusion so difficult?  We're trying to do better than nature and it appears that nature, trying its very best at the heart of our star, is doing a rather humdrum job.  In the short term (\"short\" meaning roughly *3 million years* in this context), there is many orders of magnitude more energy just in the pressure of the solar core than there is in the fusion taking place in the sun.  Without that pressure, we get no fusion at all.  And on top of that, we would need to efficiently extract the energy released by fusion.  Unless we are exceptionally clever (and as you'll read from other responses in this thread, we actually are pretty clever), we can't perform the same type of fusion that the sun does without first building up an insurmountable energy deficit.**Edit:** By the way, to quantify these claims, including my \"3 million years\" figure, I pulled some numbers directly from Wikipedia's article on [the solar core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core).  The power density is 276.5 W/m^3, which works out to 0.1308 W/pint.  The pressure, which can also be interpreted as the pressure energy per unit volume, is 265 billion bars (261 billion atmospheres).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 9521, "stickied": false, "score": 145, "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 11:45:16 2017", "ups": 145}], "subreddit": "askscience", "selftext": "", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "744w7q", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "What are the main complications stopping us from using nuclear fusion?", "num_comments": 1217, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 14282, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 5397, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/744w7q/what_are_the_main_complications_stopping_us_from/", "submission_time": "Wed Oct  4 05:14:36 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "the temperature needed is 6 [times](http://science.howstuffworks.com/fusion-reactor2.htm) hotter than the sun because we cannot achieve the same density (well we are currently not attempting to anyways).the [funding](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/03/23/nuclear-fusion-reactor-research/#.WdRHXVtSypo) has always been less than required. always 30 years [away](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/03/23/nuclear-fusion-reactor-research/)most of the \"efforts\" are really just a camouflage for nuclear weapons testing.  if you come up with a good way for fusion you just made a great bomb.  even if you dont succeed you will likely learn something about improve yields or decreasing weight/input energy.[this](https://phys.org/news/2017-03-path-nuclear-fusion.html) appears to be the best bet to me anyways.  it is basically breaking or atleast bending the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle .   we need some way to promote the particles from fusing in a non natural way, increase the chance of collisions by forcing particles into one another.there is also the \"problem\" that solar power is pretty dam (depending on your latitude) cheap and abundant.

Everytime I say men I mean men who obsess over the false accusations thing and use it against feminism. I feel this is a relatively new phenomena... not women falsely accusing men of rape but males claiming oppression because of it. I find this to be an incredible non-issue, and an inadvertent attempt to regress the feminist movement. The further we go, unapologetically taking away a man's right to violate a woman in any way, shape or form, they seem to be increasingly uncomfortable with it. For example, people are falsely accused of murder. We don't take this up with attempted murder victims, or advocate against laws that prevent murder. Every time a woman falsely accuses a man of rape, it becomes a huge deal and is cited as reasons females have privilege over men. One might argue that it is a privilege because men can not exploit the system to ruin a woman's life simply by accusing her of rape, which admittedly, would most likely not be taken as seriously or cause the same backlash. However, this in itself is a symptom of toxic masculinity, advocated by the patriarchy-not feminism. And while this fact may be true, it illustrates a deeper contention these men harbor.The reason I feel this way is because **I don't feel it is logical or natural to feel the need to obsess over being falsely accused of something, so far as to spend excessive amount of time speaking/arguing etc about it** I believe the only reason this is even a thing is because it is a male vs. female issue. I believe there is something there subconsciously that resents the power women are beginning to demand and the notion that they may have to one day see us as equals. I believe this something irks these men, in a way they can not identify, they know they don't like the idea that rape is now defined in more clear terms, and that bullying a woman sexually is getting a little more difficult to get away with. When I say rape I don't mean breaking into a room in the middle of the night with a ski mask with a knife to the throat- These men are clearly against this and see this as abhorrent. I mean rape as in a close friend taking advantage of the fact that a woman is intoxicated and pushing himself on her even though she is clearly resistant. There is no more room for leeway or speculation. If she did not consent, it is rape. I can only imagine how much this shift must have helped women, men will now think twice before pulling something like that. He is no longer safe in the knowledge that she will be slut-shamed, that she will be scared to speak out. I'm not saying these things don't still happen, but I do believe the trend of trivializing rape and magnifying a woman's sexual conquests is starting to shift. We are on the path to leveling it out currently, a woman's sexual freedom is being encouraged, and rape in ways previously perceived as harmless are being called out for they are.   I just want to ponder on that right there for a moment. **Why is it so ridiculous and oppressive to require a simple acknowledgement of consent before sex?** No one is asking people to sign a contract before having sex, but even if that was required I still don't feel the backlash we are receiving is justified. If it can protect the safety of your fellow humans why is it seen as a huge oppression/inconvenience/atrocity rather than a part of life? No one complains about being ID'd before being served alcohol or entering a nightclub. Yes, it's unfortunate that some people can not drink responsibly at a certain age, and yes it's unfortunate that some people lie about their age and put the business at risk, yes it's slightly inconvenient that you need to carry your ID on you and pull it out and explicitly show the doorman even though you're innocent and are not partaking in either of those two things. But we do it without complaint or thought don't we? We do it out of habit because we understand that there are laws in place for everyone's protection.... we don't go on and on about the absurdity of having to show an ID. Why then is it SO ridiculous to confirm consent before sex? I mean, we are all capable of reading the room, if you find yourself in a situation where you are unsure of consent.... then just ask? Obviously, no one is even saying consent should be explicitly asked for each time before sex as a law or anything, nor am I (back to the being able to read the room thing) but just for the sake of argument even if it was, why is that SUCH a travesty if it may protect a good amount of the population? The only reason I bring that up is what is actually required, is even more trivial than signing a contract or being legally required to ask an exact question... just be respectful and sensitive towards your sexual partner. If this is followed, unless the 'victim' is genuinely trying to be malicious there is essentially no risk of being caught in a situation where there is a misunderstanding of rape. Now as for the case of the person who does falsely accuse out of nowhere just for the sake of being malicious. I just don't understand why this is a thing in specific which gets attention-especially since it's used to prevent laws that protect true victims in the first place! Basically **your fear of being falsely accused of something which you have an incredibly low chance of being falsely accused in is given more thought and deems to be a cause worth fighting against at the expense of the actual victims of that crime?!** I'm sorry but to me this is just ridiculous. If you do your research you will find the number of people that are falsely accused is incredibly low. There will always be people who are able to make false accusations *for any crime*. Making a false accusation of any sort is relatively easy, getting the person *convicted* on the other hand is a lot more difficult, but this holds true with *any* crime. People falsely accuse others of murders but *why do I not know the names of these people doing the accusations?* Why is there no movement against organizations that condemn countries that are committing genocide because it is so easy to accuse a country of committing genocide? Because that is a ridiculous issue to spend time fighting over. **Why is it in the news every time someone's reputation is ruined because they are falsely accused of rape but not in the news every time a someone is murdered because they were accused of committing a petty theft?**While these are both issues my last thought I will leave you with is the inherent sexism I see in the way we tackle said issues. Never have I seen such an obsession with the idea of being falsely accused of a crime, at expense at the victims of the crime itself. When someone is falsely accused of a different crime such as theft or murder, we do not fixate on his accuser and fixate on how we can make it so that in the future his accuser will have less credibility or have a harder time prosecuting. We do not blame people who advocate against theft or murder or try to hinder their cause. We do not use it against them to make it more difficult to report or prosecute such crimes. We instead worry about why the due process to determine the accused's innocence did not take place. We worry about why the system failed said person, *We don't direct that towards the group of victims most susceptible to the crime in retaliation*. I guess in the end my question then is why is it that rape is seen so differently than every other crime, why is it that it's a feminists job to defend or advocate jobs preventing rape, or to justify false rape accusations?

I remember one of my favorite comebacks was the quick and easy, \u201ctell me something new.\u201d This faded once I got into highschool, though it stayed as a juvenile staple in my arsenal for a while (it shouldn\u2019t have, it\u2019s not all that funny or smart). Throughout my twenties I realized I was listening more, and hadn\u2019t been utilizing my most childish quip for a long time. However, in light of my coming out to speak more with those in my life I find myself looking back at that comeback in a different light.

They list and explain the facts or some article they\u2019ve read, they tell me what women are like or how we think, they try to explain why poor people are poor or why I\u2019m ignoring violence against men when I\u2019m talking about violence towards women.

Please enlighten me on things I say that are harmful, because I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone. Please let me know if anything I say about the white male experience differs from what you have experienced because I have not lived that experience.  Then please shut up when I talk about misogyny.

Don\u2019t go spouting off statistics or explaining why women aren\u2019t in certain fields, don\u2019t go making excuses or naming biological reasons for why there aren\u2019t more women in leadership. Because here is a secret I want to tell you, nothing you\u2019re saying, nothing in your perspective or interpretation, is something new. I know the facts and I\u2019ve read about the subject extensively, I\u2019m normally every bit as educated on issues we are discussing as you are. And when I\u2019m voicing issues I face that does not mean I am ignoring the issues you face. It means I\u2019m telling you about my specific problems. I\u2019m showing you the flat tire on my car, yes thank you for pointing out that I also have a broken headlight, but I think I should fix the tire before getting to the headlight.This is why \u2018not all men\u2019 is a joke. This is why women roll their eyes when you try to play devil\u2019s advocate or make excuses for the side that is easier for you to empathize with. This is what we\u2019re talking about when we say \u2018mansplaining\u2019. You're not teaching us anything new, all your 'smart points' and information, all your understandings of misogyny and your perception, it's likely we already know. We have heard it all before. We know it's not the only problem. We know it's not all men. We know the issue just as well as you.  And for all of the white women out there like me. This goes for us as well. I imagine this is one reason why black women are so fed up talking with us, this is why the queer community gets so tired explaining their realities, everything we\u2019re telling them when we think we're creating good discussion is something they have heard thousands of times before, they have likely experienced it or researched it. They already know. We aren't adding anything to the conversation they haven't heard before. Those facing more discrimination because of intersectionality usually understand more of the world\u2019s problems than we can because we are blind to their daily realities. So straight women listen to your gay friends, rich people listen to the poor.  Shut the fuck up and stop speaking down. Most importantly, *listen* when someone is speaking up. There are pains you can never know, experiences you will never have, and difficulties you will never face. Accept the truth your fellows are telling you about their lives.

It consisted of approximately 100 people (+/-) standing outside with majority of them holding signs saying:# *ABORTION KILLS CHILDREN* The crowd consisted of a mostly middle-age to young-elderly demographic (most had grey heads of hair), a priest, and four children who clearly either didn't know why they were there or didn't care, because they were off playing behind the protesters.Now I get that there is always going to be two sides to this coin, that's not what I'm here to talk about. They are standing outside of a place where girls, women, and whomever is accompanying them, are going to do something that was likely one of the *hardest* decisions they'll ever have to make in their life. Now, I'm a male. I have the luxury of (neatly) peeing while standing and not dealing with this matter directly, but that doesn't mean I'm immune to its effects. A girlfriend of mine had once opened up to me about one of these events; how it really shook her, and how it took her a while to move on. I spoke with her at length about this afterward, and I just couldn't accurately describe the quite rage that brewed inside of me as I ran past these people with my dog. Again, I don't want to start this whole debate, but please see this one side just this once. Everyone deserves that choice; and if these women made their choices, it likely wasn't all that easy for them. All of a sudden, when these people show up holding these signs... I can only imagine what is going through their head at the time. I know personally I would start to feel incredibly insecure about myself, and my choice and my mind would start reeling... \"Am I doing the right thing? What if they're right? Will I ever be able to fix it?\" I'd be going in so many directions it'd be a miracle if I was able to keep it together at all. It disheartens me so to see that even though people have these different opinions, and neither can ever be unanimously defined as \"correct,\" we don't respect each other enough as humans to leave well enough alone. Are they physically hurting you for making those choices? No? Then hop off. The whole event took me as stating:#*You are doing something bad, and that makes us better than you*It was disgusting. How dare you tear other people down just to make yourself feel better. This was a church congregation for crying out loud; have you no shame? I can almost picture the priest saying: \"After Sunday mass let's gather outside the hospital at 11am sharp to publicly shame these women; and don't forget you signs! Oh and Therese? bring Johnny and Lyanne with you so that it looks like we have children supporters as well.\"I don't really know why I decided to write about this here. I often just browse through, read the disheartening stuff and watch for it IRL so that I might change something, or read the good stuff and props the man/woman/human who made my heart warm and fuzzy. This time, I guess I just wanted to write something like this to tell the people who are in that situation that *I* am aware, they are *not* alone, and judgement won't *ever* come from me. I also wanted to tell the people who might be against such an act that it's not easy, okay? Try and put yourself in their shoes and... just.... just don't make it worse for them than it already is.

I do not have 2 X Chromosomes, although I wish I did; I am a trans-woman, and have been full-time for quite awhile. I recently married the love of my life, and over the course of the first year together, sex was fiery, passionate, and incredible. My spouse got their first big-person job, and works long hours, and is often depressed. I go to shool full-time, and work part-time. Ever since they started working full-time our frequency of sex has diminished to once a week, to less than once a month at this point. I know that they were a victim of rape, and that plays heavily into their disinterest in sex. I don't want to have sex more with them. I just want them to want to have sex with me, and I'd like to get us both their in the healthiest way possible. I've never not immediately stopped when asked, and I've never behaved in a negative in the context of sex. I even get turned off when I can tell that my spouse isn't even the mood, and they are just doing foreplay for me. I have brought up the idea of couples therapy, and it was met with agreement, but for the time being, they are trying to put on a happy face, but i can read through it, just like they can read through mine when they ask if I am happy. I mean, I am happy overall, in general, but I do feel empathy for their situation; if it is the case, that they would want to have sex with me but cannot. I recently tried to voice my concerns as best I could, and it was met level-headedly, but I am not sure what concrete steps to actually take, what type of exercises to do, etc. We both kind of got naked last night, after spending the whole afternoon just hanging out and talking to one another and eating/prepping dinner. I enjoyed making out, and didn't anticipate sex in the slightest, as we agreed to just hang out naked. (Which I think is a good exercise, right? i mean, trying to be as passive, and non-invasive as possible)i have a lot of different thoughts going around: what if they are out of love with me? what if its my male anatomy triggering them? (maybe there was a reason they are a lesbian, and i am an idiot) The thing that hurt the most was when I spoke with them and they said \"i love you; I personally would be happy if we never had sex again\" (meaning that they would find fulfillment in our relationship if were not to ever have sex again) I feel like it was a lie though, not to me, but to themselves. I've gotten a lot of perspective from them, in terms of what it feels like to be dealing with social issues having been a victim of rape, feeling like your very existence is asking for unsolicited gross sexual provocations. I cant say I truly understand the feeling, but I have a good idea. Conversely, on my end, I have social issues, where I feel like everyone is looking at me, also externally or internally expressing feelings of disgust. (or also gross expressions of desire)  (i also worked as a sex-worker for several years, so that probably didn't help me on a psychological level too much) So, what I desire most, what really makes me feel fulfilled, is someone(with whom I share love and affection) expressing genuine lust for me on a physical level; I want someone to want me, not just because I am their fetish, but because we connect on a physical and emotional level, and they find me physically appealing. Not because they think Im sexually frustrated (which is also true, but not the reason of my bummed state of mind), but because they want me. Where do we go from here?

Apparently Self-Insurance is on the rise in the US, and it basically means that your employer foots the bill for your medical expenses, rather than footing the bill for your insurance.

The software actually makes attempts to obscure personally identifying data. But if a company is self-insured, they have access to this data.

Sounds like a typical school to me. Anytime there was drama at my school, classmates would watch until the teacher puts a stop to it. Plus these kids watching are in middle school and can't be expected to have the maturity of an adult. Punish the bully for sure but this whole situation has been taken WAAAAY too far. Kids will watch because they're curious and don't know better. They definitely do not deserve suspension for simply watching and recording to show peers the latest fight at school. Kid may be a bully but a police investigation is over the top. This attack could have been anything from a shove to a headbutt but the article never says that Perez was forced to seek medical attention. So it's likely the bully was just being the asshole we all had in school.>\"I'm not going let it fade away,\" Perez said. \"I'm going to make sure that people know that trans lives, every life, matters.\"*Sigh* Highly doubt anyone tried to kill her. Someone probably fed her this bullshit line when in reality she just doesn't want to be bullied. Nobody is really helping her. It's just a bunch of virtue signalling people looking for brownie points from the public instead of actually trying to help the kid.
