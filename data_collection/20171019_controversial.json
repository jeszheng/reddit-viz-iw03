The day my restaurant says \"hey, we're going to eliminate tipping, and pay you guys $15/hr\" is the day I quit and go find a different restaurant to work at. My breakdown for the month of Sept has me taking home, (after taxes) $28/hr. And that is with some pretty lousy days in there, because Sept is a lousy month in my town for restaurants. I work right around 40 hours a week, 6 days a week, a mix of lunches and dinners. (all dinners would probably increase my hourly average takehome to $35+ but I like having some freedom to do things) There is no way the average guest is going to pay the needed increase on every plate to staff a restaurant with the same number of waiters and bartenders (not to mention hostesses, bussers, and food runners, because they get paid via tipshare, which cuts a nice chunk out of what the restaurant has to offer them hourly.) So the menu prices in my current restaurant would probably go up somewhere around $5-7 per plate, you'd have less waiters on, the skilled ones (which would be pretty much all the staff in my current place) would leave that day, and you can't replace them, because nobody else with the same skills is going to work for that hourly.   So now you have skyrocketing labor costs, an unskilled, uneducated staff with less bodies because you can't afford to have 22 waiters working for the restaurants cost of $2.13/hr on a saturday night. Service goes to shit, your Per-Person-Average goes down because there's no knowledge for upselling via plate addons or cocktail/wine pairings. You have to pay full minimum wage to your Hostesses, Bussers and Foodrunners, so that staffing goes down to half of what it is currently, or the each plate price goes up another $3-4. Overnight, that $34 6 oz filet is now costing the guest $44-$46, and they aren't getting nearly the service they received last week because instead of 1 waiter taking care of 3-4 tables, they have to run around 6-7 tables. In my restaurant, doing 3 course meals, that's brutal. And less waiters means faster rotations, so instead of your waiter spending some time going over the menu, talking about specials, answering questions, it's going to be, \"what do you want to drink?  be back in 5 minutes... what do you want to eat?\" because that waiter just got sat again, and needs to go greet those people too. There's no real service being given at that point. Lunches? Sure, you're totally going to get people paying $17-$18 for a burger... I mean it's a good burger, but nobody is going to pay $17. We already run as few waiters as we can for lunches, because it's a short time span of activity with few courses, so that way waiters can make money. Now you'd have to cut 1 waiter from each shift, assuming the price increases didn't kill off my entire lunch crowd. You might as well just have a cashier taking orders up front for all the service the guests are going to get.End result, take a classy restaurant, cut out tipping, make it a pay cut hourly for the waiters, watch the restaurant close inside of 2 months.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 695, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 11:28:14 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "Because there would be a lag between all of us collectively making this decision (if this were possible) and employers adjusting wages upward.

Maybe make people get cancer from him if he spends long time with them (like what happened to Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen) or make him always question humanity like \"are this stupid people worth fighting for\" ( .... to think of it again like Dr. Manhattan).

In perfect specular reflection, all incident light essentially reflects everywhere off the surface such that the angle of reflection is the angle of incidence. Like the left image here:http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/refln/u13l1d3.gifThis basically means that the surface is \"smooth\" in terms of reflection.  On the other hand, in diffuse reflection, the surface is rough and thus each incident ray is seeing a slightly different surface and thus reflects off at random angles depending on where it lands on the surface.Thus, a mirror is an example of mostly specular reflection when illuminated where a white t-shirt is an example of diffuse reflection (due to the cottons strands making for a very uneven surface)Now, as you've said, an object that is truly black, what is called \"a perfect black-body\", should absorb ALL light in the visible spectrum and thus one should receive no light from it and it should have no reflection under illumination.However, in reality there is no such thing as a perfect black-body and thus all materials will reflect at least SOME light off at least their surface, if not the bulk.   In a similar vein, no material is 100% transparent and it will always reflect and absorb at least some light.But what is happening with a piano is actually a bit more,  because the look is ENGINEERED by having TWO surfaces,  The first layer is a fairly-but-not-totally transparent top layer that has a flat surface.  That means that most of the light gets through it, but a good chunk doesn't and reflects off the front and because of the smoothness of the surface it reflects specularly.  The light that makes it through the quasi-transparent layer then meets the black paint, and is mostly absorbed (though some reflects here too).  Thus, in a nutshell (and I'm totally making up these numbers), you've created a case where you start with 100% light, then a top layer reflects 20% of it specularly and transmits 80% and then the black layer underneath eats the 80%.There's an interesting aside here I'll maybe draw attention to, which is that having multiple layers with different properties is actually the reason for a lot of the \"flavour\" and variety of sights we see (rather than just having a single layer).  And in general, much of what we see CANNOT be modeled by assigning  reflection/albedo properties to a single layer alone. This compounding effect of multiple layers of different properties actually plays a big role in computer graphics, where it is called \"Subsurface scattering\".  I'll drop the wiki to that topic here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scatteringBut it's probably not worth going fully into here, but this is the reason why old CGI moves like Toy Story looked so plasticy (Pixar, of course, brilliantly turned a bug into a feature in that movie).  Because it's not possible to create the kind of visual surfaces we see in real life by treating them as only a single layer with some properties, you have to compound the effect of multiple layers.  There's a lot of aspects to this in the surface of something like a piano (or marble).  It's a multi-layer effect.  And it's also worth noting that although it's often possible to \"cheat\" these effects using only one or two layers, this kind of sub-surface complexity can happen within a single material, and it need not be the case that you literally have multiple spatially separated layers, but rather you have reflections from different depths of the surface of just a single material behaving slightly differently.  So even in a single material you may not be able to model its reflection by treating it as a single surface. (the converse is also the case, it may sometimes be possible to take a real life surface appearance that is physically caused by multiple layers and \"fake\" it with a single layer with specially chosen properties).", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 61068, "stickied": false, "score": 2263, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 17:39:15 2017", "ups": 2263}, {"body": "In modern pianos, the black paint can be covered with a variety of materials, from traditional lacquer to modern polyurethanes and polyester resins, which provide the glossy finish.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 15843, "stickied": false, "score": 64, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 17:18:49 2017", "ups": 64}, {"body": "When light hits an object, several things may happen.The light may be absorbed.

Thus, in a nutshell (and I'm totally making up these numbers), you've created a case where you start with 100% light, then a top layer reflects 20% of it specularly and transmits 80% and then the black layer underneath eats the 80%.There's an interesting aside here I'll maybe draw attention to, which is that having multiple layers with different properties is actually the reason for a lot of the \"flavour\" and variety of sights we see (rather than just having a single layer).  And in general, much of what we see CANNOT be modeled by assigning  reflection/albedo properties to a single layer alone. This compounding effect of multiple layers of different properties actually plays a big role in computer graphics, where it is called \"Subsurface scattering\".  I'll drop the wiki to that topic here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scatteringBut it's probably not worth going fully into here, but this is the reason why old CGI moves like Toy Story looked so plasticy (Pixar, of course, brilliantly turned a bug into a feature in that movie).  Because it's not possible to create the kind of visual surfaces we see in real life by treating them as only a single layer with some properties, you have to compound the effect of multiple layers.  There's a lot of aspects to this in the surface of something like a piano (or marble).  It's a multi-layer effect.  And it's also worth noting that although it's often possible to \"cheat\" these effects using only one or two layers, this kind of sub-surface complexity can happen within a single material, and it need not be the case that you literally have multiple spatially separated layers, but rather you have reflections from different depths of the surface of just a single material behaving slightly differently.  So even in a single material you may not be able to model its reflection by treating it as a single surface. (the converse is also the case, it may sometimes be possible to take a real life surface appearance that is physically caused by multiple layers and \"fake\" it with a single layer with specially chosen properties).", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 61068, "stickied": false, "score": 2257, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 17:39:15 2017", "ups": 2257}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/77dhtp/how_can_objects_like_a_piano_be_completely_black/", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "First off, what you're referring to is chandrashekar *mass*, not limit.White dwarfs are responsible for 1a supernovae.

But I think locality can be expressed, perhaps, in a \"math-lite\" way, so let's try to do that.The principle of locality can be expressed in a few different - though quite related - ways, but I'm just going to explain the most straightforward way of expressing it. In this way, it amounts to a restriction on how and in what way a present state of a system is mathematically allowed to depend on the state of the same system at an earlier time.  Let's imagine how something like a scalar field behaves in time.  A \"scalar field\" is just math talk for basically just a function f(x,y,z,t), meaning that for every point in space (x,y,z) and time (t) there is some number f assigned. It is a \"field\", i.e. something that assigns a mathematical object to every point x,y,z,t, and that mathematical object in this case is a \"scalar\", i.e. just a number (rather than a vector or tensor or whatever).  Thus \"scalar\" \"field\".  An example of a scalar field might be the temperature in the room you're in,  we could call it a \"the temperature scalar field\" and for every point in your room and at a given time there's a defined temperature associated with that point in space and time (say 20 degrees Celsius).  We might call this field, in math language: T(x,y,z,t)  which means it's an object that you plug in an input of an \"x\", a \"y\", a \"z\" and a \"t\" and it returns the temperature \"T\" at that point and time.So what does it mean for this temperature field to obey \"local\" laws of physics?  Well let's imagine I want to determine what the temperature at a specific point (x0,y0,z0) will be at that same spot but at a time that is just the tiniest bit in the future.  If we say the present is t0 then I want to know  what \"T\" will be at the point (x0,y0,z0) but at the time t0+dt where \"dt\" just means \"a small amount\" (an infinitesimal time later, if  you know calculus, if you don't it doesn't matter).  So this is the question, if I want to know T(x0,y0,z0,t0+dt) what do I need to know about T(x,y,z,t0).  Now keep in mind what I mean here, T(x,y,z,t) (x,y,z,t are general variables, not specific values like x0,y0,z0,t0) means complete knowledge of \"T\" at all points in space and time, like I'm a temperature omniscient deity.  But the question I'm asking if I only want to know the value of the temperature at ONE SPECIFIC point in space and time, how much do I need to know about T.  Do I need to know the temperature everywhere at t0, i.e. do I need to know T at x0+2000 km or at z0-3,000,000 km, do I need to know T(x,y,z,t0) for ALL values of x,y and z that can exist?  Everywhere at all times?  Or only some places in t0? etc.If the temperature scalar field obeys \"locality\" then what it means is that the laws of how temperature changes in time are such that if I want to know T(x0,y0,z0,t0+dt)  I ONLY need to know the temperature at that same point a moment earlier T(x0,y0,z0,t0) AND the temperature at points that are immediately next to that point:T(x0+dx,y0,z0), T(x0-dx,y0,z0), T(x0,y0+dy,z0),T(x0,y0-dy,z0), and so on (where dx,dy,dz means a \"tiny bit in that direction\").  In a local theory, the value of at T(x,y,z,t) only depends on the value of T at the same point a moment before as well as its value in some very tiny neighbourhood in its vicinity.  It doesn't depend on T anywhere else but that small neighbourhood.That's what is meant by \"locality\".  If you know your calculus it can be pretty succinctly be described as: the value of T(x0,y0,z0,t0) can only depend on derivatives of T(x,y,z,t) evaluated at (x0,y0,z0,t0) and on external functions (like an external potential) evaluated at (x0,y0,z0,t0).  It can't depend on anything else.So a non-local theory basically has laws dictating its dynamics such that T(x0,y0,z0,t0+dt) depend on the complete knowledge of T(x,y,z,t0) (i.e. you need to know the temperature everywhere in the universe at time t0 to calculate what \"T\" will be at the point x0,y0,z0 and a time t0+dt). If you know Calculus then T(x,y,z,t) might depend on term like integral(T(x,y,z,t)*g(x2,y2,z2,t), integrate over all (x2,y2,z2)) (you can safely ignore this if it means nothing to you).So, in a local temperature theory, if I want to know the temperature in Paris in 1 second, I only need to know the temperature of the air at paris currently and maybe the immediate vicinity. Note that the point here is that 1 second is small, if I want to know the temperature of paris in 4 weeks the \"neighbourhood\" I need to consider may very well grow to be quite large, likely the whole planet, but that's fine and has to do with the FINITE SPEED with which two temperature points T(x0,y0,z0,t0)  and T(x1,y1,z1,t0+ 4 weeks) can be causally linked.

Also, since those with compromised immune systems are more likely to come into contact with highly infectious strains, vaccinating against these strains would provide a herd immunity to protect the vulnerable.  2. **The cheapest vaccinations to produce and manufacture are prioritized.** I am assuming that only a handful of flu strains are characterized well enough to cheaply synthesize a vaccine. Additionally, the seasonal flu vaccine is very cheap, to where pharmacies can administer them for less than 20 dollars. Money and profit is always a motivator when decisions are made.  3. **The deadliest strains are prioritized.** Prioritizing the strains that might be less infectious but have a higher mortality rate would decrease the overall burden on the health care system. I'm guessing that the deadlier strains would result in increased hospital visits and health care costs for a small number of people, compared to a greater number of people with minor symptoms. Vaccinating against the deadliest strains would not only save more lives, but also decrease the burdens on the hospitals and ERs.  4. **The strains that are local to my area are prioritized.** I could be wrong, but flu outbreaks might be local.

With that being said, how are the gravitational effects of a body, such as a planet or sun, calculated in relation to its size? I'm thinking that for a relatively small dense body, calculating its effect on another body at a relatively great distance would be a matter of calculating the effects of an infinitely small point with equal mass to the actal planet, with the same center of gravity. As if all of the mass of the planet were focused in a single mathematical coordinate in space, rather than distributed over several thousand miles of diameter. This seems like a simple equation, that the force between the 2 bodies would be calculated by their mass and distance, regardless of their respective size. How does this change for objects that are very close together? for example, calculating the pull of gravity of a person standing on its surface? From that distance, the distributiong of mass seems more significant, as it is not all focused in some far off single point, but distributed essentially on a plane that stretches out in every direction from the point where the person is standing, not just directly downward towards the center of the planet. Does that just get insanely complicated and a best estimate is used?Where this could get even more interesting would be calculating the influence of 2 very large, very dense bodies with no atmosphere passing extremely close to each other in space. Like 2 massive planets moving so quickly that they pass each other within a handful of miles without colliding. If the shape of each planet was irregular, it seems the gravitational interaction of various parts of the planet and the distribution of their mass would be crucial to understanding how their respective courses would change after passing. I imagine it would go far beyond the video game approximation of a planete, which would essentially be a massless solid sphere with an infinitely small center of gravity containing all of its mass, so the force of gravity just pulls directly to the core, no matter the distance to the surface.Another thought: how would this change the effect of gravity beneath the surface of the planet? If one were to theoretically dig a hole to the center of the earth, there would be no gravity felt except that of the sun and moon, correct? The planet's gravity would be pulling you equally in all directions from that point, essentially negating itself.

In the words of Kathleen Barry, consent is not a \u201cgood divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and **consent to violation is a fact of oppression. Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of \u201cconsent,\u201d since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see, or feel any alternative**.Some feminists, including many who identify as supporting the abolition of prostitution, see the selling of sex as a potential after effect of violence against women. Advocates for this position claim: **most women in prostitution experience a very high level of violence both in childhood before they entering and while in prostitution. Studies of violence experienced by women in prostitution prior to entering prostitution show 60% to 70% were sexually abused as children that 65% had been raped, most before the age of 15, and that many young women and girls enter prostitution directly from state care, at least in England, Norway, Australia and Canada.**Prostitution abolitionists also object to the high rates of violence against women in the sex industry. **Studies of women in prostitution show an extremely high level of violence is perpetrated against women in prostitution. Figures vary across studies. One representative study showed 82% of respondents had been physically assaulted since entering prostitution, 55% of those by johns. Additionally, 80% had been physically threatened while in prostitution, 83% of those with a weapon. 8% reported physical attacks by pimps and johns of a nature that resulted in serious injury, for example gunshot wounds and knife wounds. 68% reported having been raped since entering prostitution, 48% more than five times and 46% reporting rapes committed by johns.

In the words of Kathleen Barry, consent is not a \u201cgood divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and **consent to violation is a fact of oppression. Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of \u201cconsent,\u201d since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see, or feel any alternative**.Some feminists, including many who identify as supporting the abolition of prostitution, see the selling of sex as a potential after effect of violence against women. Advocates for this position claim: **most women in prostitution experience a very high level of violence both in childhood before they entering and while in prostitution. Studies of violence experienced by women in prostitution prior to entering prostitution show 60% to 70% were sexually abused as children that 65% had been raped, most before the age of 15, and that many young women and girls enter prostitution directly from state care, at least in England, Norway, Australia and Canada.**Prostitution abolitionists also object to the high rates of violence against women in the sex industry. **Studies of women in prostitution show an extremely high level of violence is perpetrated against women in prostitution. Figures vary across studies. One representative study showed 82% of respondents had been physically assaulted since entering prostitution, 55% of those by johns. Additionally, 80% had been physically threatened while in prostitution, 83% of those with a weapon. 8% reported physical attacks by pimps and johns of a nature that resulted in serious injury, for example gunshot wounds and knife wounds. 68% reported having been raped since entering prostitution, 48% more than five times and 46% reporting rapes committed by johns. Finally, 49% reported pornography was made of them while they were in prostitution and 32% had been upset by an attempt to make them do what johns had seen in pornography.

There will be provided links to professional help options. The whole website will be completely costless and safe from hate.

I dont really like talking about my personal life but they're all very open about their lives and have known each other for like 10 years. Here's what happened today: So I woke up this morning 7.21am and dragged myself to work. I hate this job and always dread it but whatever. I've got my period right now again and it's so ew, and I was just feeling so tired and couldn't be bothered to answer the phone and generally talk to people but ya know you have to be professional no matter what the weather's like. The phone kept ringing and it was doing my head in and people were just always complaining urvh.  I did some photocopying shit just so I didn't have to answer the phones or be in there tbh. I went to the toilet to sort myself out cos i was just feeling really uncomfortable and just sat there for a bit like why do I have to be here my vagina feels awful. Then went back to the office, one of the girls said have you had the shits (office is really informal). Awkwardly said haha no just got stomach pains. Later went back to the toilet and just thought I really don't want to be here and just stood there tbh. I just want to be left alone. Just alone. Manager was in our office and I just looked at her and said can I go ? She nodded and said yea you're really not looking well. So on my way out I thought fuck yes i can just lie in bed and not talk to anyone :D everyone was being nice and sympathetic so I stated tearing ???? Wtf. I was trying to get my phone and just run out of there. One of the other girls caught up and said you okay ? You would say if there was anything wrong ? I said yea and walled straight home with full on tears in my eyes. I ate loads of stupid food and feel so shit in general and then just sat on the toilet for a bit, good times. Now I'm here on reddit. Glad I'm not at work having to deal with people. :D but im going to have to deal.with questions tomorrow and the whole round of 'you can trust me, im here if you need to talk' when I reality I just really hate my job. :D and I just completely stuffed myself with junk for no reason :D Good times Posting cos I dont know where else to put this and I'm just trying to process my thoughts right now.

But statistics on men's violence against women, while shocking, only tell part of the story. Another part of the story unfolds in women's daily lives. To demonstrate this concretely, I request the students' participation in an interactive exercise. I draw a line down the middle of a chalkboard, sketching a male symbol on one side, a female symbol on the other. Then I ask just the men: \"What steps do you guys take, on a daily basis, to prevent yourselves from being sexually assaulted?\"At first there is a kind of awkward silence as the men try to figure out if they've been asked a trick question. The silence gives way to a smattering of nervous laughter. Occasionally a young guy will raise his hand and say: \"I stay out of prison.\" This is typically followed by another moment of laughter, before someone finally raises his hand and soberly states \"Nothing. I don't think about it.\" Then I ask the women the same question. \"What steps do you take on a daily basis to prevent yourselves from being sexually assaulted?\" Women throughout the audience immediately start raising their hands. As the men sit in stunned silence, the women recount safety precautions they take as part of their daily routine. Here are some of their answers:Hold my keys as a potential weapon. Look in the back seat of the car before getting in. Carry a cell phone. Don't go jogging at night. Lock all the windows when I go to sleep, even on hot summer nights. Be careful not to drink too much. Don't put my drink down and come back to it; make sure I see it being poured. Own a big dog. Carry mace or pepper spray. Have an unlisted phone number. Have a man's voice on my answering machine. Park in well-lit areas. Don't use parking garages. Don't get on elevators with only one man, or with a group of men. Vary my route home from work. Watch what I wear. Don't use highway rest areas. Use a home alarm system. Don't wear headphones when jogging. Avoid forests or wooded areas, even in the daytime. Don't take a first-floor apartment. Go out in groups. Own a firearm. Meet men on first dates in public places. Make sure to have a car or cab fare. Don't make eye contact with men on the street. Make assertive eye contact with men on the street.The exercise can go on for almost half an hour. Invariably the board fills up on the women's side. This is true, with slight variations, in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Many women say the list is like an unconscious mental checklist. Despite three decades of Take Back The Night rallies and feminist consciousness-raising about the politics of women's safety, surprisingly few women in audiences where I've presented think about their daily routine in terms of larger cultural issues or political questions. \u201cIt's just the way it is,\" they say. \u201cIt\u2019s what we have to do to feel safe.\u201d (At the end of the exercise, I always hasten to point out that most sexual assaults are perpetrated not by strangers lurking in the bushes, but by men who know their victims -- often in the victim\u2019s home.) Some women do get angry when they see the radical contrast between the women's side of the chalkboard, which is always full, and the men's, which is almost always blank.Some men react emotionally when they contemplate the full chalkboard on the women's side. They're shocked, saddened, angered. Many report its effects as life-changing.

We live in the same apartment complex in a small college town. We have had a very open friendship, to the point that he tells me about his sexual experiences in detail whenever we see each other. When he moved away over the summer, this didn't change. Whenever he had cell service, he would call me and we would talk. We have had some minor sensual encounters, but nothing too intense. I have and do love him. Still, he knows that I am very invested in his life. I have been his designated driver, his shoulder to cry on, and he's reciprocated in every way he can. I felt like we were going to be in each other's lives forever. But tonight, I got an awful phone call.    Jordan was frantic. He was like a caged animal. He was talking too loud, too fast and couldn't make it through a sentence without yelling. He eventually got his story out. He was with one of our neighbors, a girl he's been into for months. They were having a weekend together, had been doing non-penetrative sex acts and he asked if he could have sex with her. She said no, but he did. He claims she was into it based on her body movements, participation, etc. But in the week following, the full impact hit her, and she went to a clinic for testing, blocked Jordan on every platform, and called the police. (I fully support her making all of these choices) Jordan was elk hunting at the time, and got home to a sheriff's card. That's when he called me. He was crying, realizing that even though she said it was okay and that she loved him after the event, she was likely going to press charges. He knows what he did was wrong, and doesn't begrudge her her actions. But he is terrified of going to prison, and likely getting beat and raped there. He is willing to accept this, and if he doesn't go to prison, he's planning to postpone his education so she can finish without seeing him around.I felt nauseated. I know and love this kid. I was making out with him less than a day before this. How are you supposed to feel when someone you love turns out to be a rapist? I went for a walk after the conversation and ran into the girl. We talked for a bit, and she ended up crying. She just kept saying \"It wouldn't be so hard if it was someone I didn't care about.\" I didn't have anything to say except \"I'm sorry, I'm here to talk if you need, do you want a hug?\" We've never been close, but we know each other, and I don't know if/how to help her. It's not like you can make a cake that says \"I'm sorry you were raped by the guy we both love.\" And I don't know how to help, when Jordan gave me their story  and I doubt she wanted me to know, but I doubt even more that she told anyone else. I know that consent to one act is not consent to all. I am completely gutted with Jordan's actions, and I side with the girl fully. I know it's wrong, but I still love this guy, both as a friend and as something more. I know Jordan, and I can't help but feel he isn't going to have anyone who cares about him if he goes to prison. I'm scared he'll kill himself, in or out of prison when more people find out about this. But I don't want to align myself with the perpetrator, especially with the girl likely also having minimal support.

People need to realise that the world isn't split into bad guys and good guys, this isn't a Disney movie. Scary music doesn't play when the bad guy walks into a room, you can't have known this would happen. Someone can be an ok person and do horrific things.  What is critical is that they recognise their actions were wrong AND fully understand to the best of their ability the consequences for the victim.You can still love and support him while in no way condoning what he has done. It's dangerous to cast out people who have committed crimes: what incentive is there then for them to reform? Your friend did something awful, it sounds as though he isn't shying away from that and is attempting to be respectful of the victim. Supporting him take responsibility for his actions is likely to translate into a better outcome for everyone involved if it means you can support his choices that respect her. And there is no need to give an inch of approval, you don't ever downplay anything.Having some tough conversations like 'why did you think her body language communicated it was ok?' could mean he is able to talk to other people about what went wrong, why he read the situation wrong, why what he did was wrong and maybe it will prevent  another rape. Maybe someone else will think 'she said no, if I keep going I will be committing rape and get charged with rape'. Cutting contact would probably be the easiest thing for you but it also cuts off the chance for genuine reform. It's not your responsibility but you might have a chance to make a broader impact here.Edit: to say i agree with other posters that you go to police with any evidence you have. And you can be honest with your friend about that 'I care about you and support you and will continue to support you through the consequences of this. I am going to cooperate with any police investigation because I believe it's the right thing to do and I believe you know that as well' Also: a guilty plea will make this a fucktonne easier on the victim.

I said no, I didn\u2019t want to have sex that night. Apparently, he didn\u2019t care, as he kept pressuring me.

It does happen but the blog posts on the internet make it seem a lot more common than it is. Cervical cancer is really, really scary. But you can't diagnose yourself with it and this reading about it on the internet seems to be having a negative impact on your mental health.Second, I have similar symptoms to the ones you describe. It was just an irregular period and the cure really was birth control. Doc thought it was a hormonal imbalance caused by life changes or stress but wasn't sure. But it took a few tries to get a birth control that actually helped me that had limited side effects. The side effects can suck pretty hard sometimes, especially if something is already wrong or off.Third, I would go to the appointment and remain as calm as possible when describing your symptoms. You can bring up your concerns about cancer, especially if you have a family history, just try to remain as calm as possible. It's sad but doctors get rather weary of hearing about \"irrational\" fears.

This is my first post on reddit. I am a nervous wreck at work right now and keeping going to the bathroom to cry and was just hoping someone could help talk me down. I don't really have anyone I can talk to this about, my boyfriend seems to believe I am overacting. I have a GYN appointment tomorrow morning. I am 26 years old (turning 27 in December), female, and live in the US. Here is my story:About 3 years ago, after getting out of the shower one day, i noticed I was bleeding outside of my period. After a few google searches, I began to believe I was showing signs of cervical cancer. At the time I was 23 years old and never had been to the gyn. I quickly made an appointment. Between that time, I was still bleeding off and on and also had a clear discharge that wasn't too pleasant. When I finally saw the doctor, she didn't seem too concerned at all. She gave me a pelvic exam and said she felt \"something\" and sent me to have an ultrasound. Turns out the ultrasound was clear and my pap was normal. She prescribed me birth control that I took and stopped after it caused me to bleed a lot. After several ER visits and other doctor visits, they convinced me I was fine and I went on my with my life.Fast forward to this past Sunday.. I was cleaning the house and felt a gush of blood ... down there. I went to the bathroom and noticed I was bleeding again. I just had my period two weeks ago. This immediately started to bring back all kinds of emotions that I felt 3 years ago. I thought I was past this. I googled myself into a frenzy and have been reading stories of women (my age) who were diagnosed with CC and their paps all came back normal. The only symptom they had that made them pursue more testing was the abnormal bleeding. The bleeding still hasn't stopped and it is Thursday. It is very light and appears to be light brownish. I also have pain only on my left side especially in my left abdomen (but I am not sure if this is due to my anxiety levels being through the roof right now). I also have a clear discharge that smells of ammonia.Basically, I am so scared that I have something seriously wrong with me. My body is telling me something is not right. I am scared that my paps are coming back clear but I may have a cancer that is not detected on paps (which apparently is more common than you think).Can anyone help ease my mind and tell me that I am being crazy? has anyone been through something similar with a good outcome?Thank you for anyone who took the time to read this.

It was just an irregular period and the cure really was birth control. Doc thought it was a hormonal imbalance caused by life changes or stress but wasn't sure. But it took a few tries to get a birth control that actually helped me that had limited side effects. The side effects can suck pretty hard sometimes, especially if something is already wrong or off.Third, I would go to the appointment and remain as calm as possible when describing your symptoms.

I\u2019m even nervous to share on reddit because I don\u2019t want anyone being mean to me or telling me that mine don\u2019t count or something. I spent most of my life thinking that my experiences were not \u201cbad\u201d enough compared to others so I felt weird sharing them. But they were very traumatic for me and that matters. Even the non typical experiences matter.I grew up very religious and very sheltered from the normal world. I went to a private Christian school and I swear I didn\u2019t even know basic sexual things. Like I didn\u2019t know what a blowjob was until I was 18. I know that sounds a little crazy but I just wasn\u2019t exposed to ANYTHING sexually related. So when I was inappropriately touched in 7th grade, I was in shock and felt confused and very dirty. I refused to even speak for about a week after it until my mom finally begged me to tell her what was wrong with me. I broke down sobbing and told her exactly what happened. I felt so humiliated and ashamed as if I had done something wrong. She was horrified and called the school and called the boys parents. I begged her not to call his parents because I didn\u2019t even want him to know I\u2019d told anyone, I just wanted to pretend like it never happened. The problem was that we had assigned seats in my class and his seat was right next to mine. So luckily they moved his seat somewhere else, but that\u2019s all they did as far as I know. The reason i called it a non typical experience is because what he did was strange and not something I\u2019ve ever heard of someone doing. I\u2019m guessing this is because he may have been just as sheltered as I was, and may have had an urge and not understood how to carry it out. We were having quiet reading time at our desks. Like I said he was sitting next to me, and he started to move his chair closer to mine. When he got his chair close enough he started to take his foot and try to push it under my seated buttocks. I really don\u2019t know how else to describe it and it sounds super weird, but he was determined to push his foot all the way under me. I was confused and at first thought maybe it was an accident but then he persisted and became more and more forceful as I tried moving my chair farther away. Every time I moved my chair he moved his closer again. I tried to think of any possible excuse to stand up. I was shaking and felt like the blood was drained from my body. I had no way to understand what was happening or why he\u2019d be doing this to me. I finally got up and went to the teacher to ask if I could be excused to the bathroom. She told me to wait until after class. I was a very timid kid and had trouble speaking up for myself so I didn\u2019t argue and walked back to my desk filled with dread. The walk to the desk felt like it was in slow motion. It was awful. As I got older I ended up having quite a few \u201cminor\u201d experiences of inappropriate behavior from boys. Another one that stands out is when a boy from my Christian club I was part of in highschool decided to playfully steal my phone and run away with it. I chased after him, very annoyed, and he ran to a secluded area where nobody could see us. I\u2019m short so he had a good old time holding my phone up very high so I had to keep jumping for it. After a couple jumps he started grabbing my boobs and grabbing my ladybits and laughing as if this was a game to him. I was livid. I knew how to speak up for myself better by this point and I elbowed him in the stomach, got my phone and ran to tell someone. Our parents made us meet up at a library with them to discuss the incident and to decide whether we were getting the cops involved. He was sobbing and clearly looked terrified. Because of my devotion to Christianity at the time I took pity on him and didn\u2019t involve the police. Years later I found out he went on to rape several girls in our highschool and beyond. Like a LOT of girls. I could have been the first. And I could have helped prevent those future rapes. I think about it all the time.Those are my two biggest, but there have been numerous drunken boob grabs, comments, etc. One of the most common things I\u2019d hear growing up (even at a very young age, though I had no idea what they meant until after 18 yrs old or so) was \u201cdoes the carpet match the drapes\u201d because I\u2019m a redhead.

UTIs after sex are really common (the easiest way to avoid them is peeing just after sex/between sex and going to bed). Pain during sex is less so - it could point to an underlying condition which might also explain your missing period. There are some medical conditions, like endometriosis, that could be the culprit, it could also be vaginismus, which doctors are very vague on. It's as far as current research knows a psychological issue due to fear/nervousness and therefore tensing up the vaginal muscles, making sex painful. There are options for all of these things though!

You're gonna be fine. The chances of you being pregnant are extremely, extremely slim. It's a lot more likely the added stress on your body from taking antibiotics and fighting off an infection are affecting your cycle, or there is something else going on. Honestly just get a pregnancy test to be absolutely sure so you can relax a little about that. It's seriously extremely unlikely that you are pregnant and probably not worth worrying about - but I totally get the feeling, because I always worry even when my period is like an hour late. It can be worth checking just to be absolutely, absolutely sure.Then: Definitely go see an OBGYN about the other issues! UTIs after sex are really common (the easiest way to avoid them is peeing just after sex/between sex and going to bed). Pain during sex is less so - it could point to an underlying condition which might also explain your missing period. There are some medical conditions, like endometriosis, that could be the culprit, it could also be vaginismus, which doctors are very vague on. It's as far as current research knows a psychological issue due to fear/nervousness and therefore tensing up the vaginal muscles, making sex painful. There are options for all of these things though! Not going to lie to you, they are not as well understood or treated as they should be, but there are options.Seriously: You are almost certainly not pregnant.
