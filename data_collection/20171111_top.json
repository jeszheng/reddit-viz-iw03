Look at his businesses, boast huge grandiose ideas, that all fall to financial ruin. He is a crook, plain and simple. He wants to be a robber Baron, and he has an absurd obsession with lineage. My problem isn't the clusterfuck that is Donald Trump, my problem is the Republicans that some how don't care. You are a white man or woman in the most powerful country on earth that has been suppressing every minority foreign and domestic for your comfort. At some point you have to expect the world to catch up and that way of life will fade. Even with that eventuality, America has enough resources and capital to train many of the poor rural white people, to progress them into the future. It would not have been the first time America moved its white populous forward while ignoring the minority citizenry. F.D.R did it, and is herald as a progressive god. Yet each time prosperity with equality is offered, Red states choose poverty, and racism. Then a Democrat gets into office and they cycle begins anew. The problem is with China's ascent this ouroboros of stupidity has caught up with them. I am confused as to what the still loyal Republican base want from Trump and the Republicans congress?Racism is better than food? Do they really believe Ryan and McConnell can force the blue state rich to do what they want?

It was Jewish scientist that made their precious atomic bombs. So I am dumbfounded by Republicans watching Trump Kowtow in his Asian trip. It's as if a cowardly aura has taken over the party and their base. Where they think life will be super sweet as long as they can beat on the minorities they know.

Not only that they also believed their leader that other politicians were promising less because they were sellouts/corrupts/compromised/not-real progressives. * Agreed with their candidate that holding large rallies in DC would convince McConnell and Paul Ryan to support such (single payer, 15$ min wage, free college) policies. * Considered themselves part of a revolution by supporting a lifelong politician who was running for another election. * Believed when their candidate said that he would have better relationship with minorities than Obama.

At the time, The Work Number was happily flying under the radar and being very \"out there\" about the way they resell this data.  This includes:- allowing debt collectors to access the data.  Now, when this 2013 stuff started getting mindshare, in an excellent display of how scummy Equifax is, they very indignantly stated that the Red Tape article was false and they don't allow debt collectors to access your salary information.  But that's only partially true.  While a debt collector can't look up exactly how much you're making, a debt collector CAN find out that you have a job, where that job is, then send in a file with a list of prospects and how much they owe, which Equifax will then return a score on.  So, of course, the less you owe and the more you make, the higher the score and the first you are in line for collection efforts.- even creeper IMHO: for high-dollar companies that have high-income clients, they will allow those companies to send in a list of clients, and Equifax will alert them if any of those clients lose their jobs or their income changes significantly.  I'd imagine this is used by places like casinos extensively so they don't unknowingly keep giving freebies to \"deadbeats\" that won't be buying anything else.The original service is arguably a good one, because it makes salary verification processes quite more streamlined and foolproof.  I'm sure that's why Equifax bought TALX in the first place, but they then proceeded to use the data for much more disgusting purposes and double-dip on it.

The working principle of this kind of transportation device involves the animal skill of walking i.e moving ground contact surfaces forward in phases to well selected spots on the ground in front of it. This kind of transportation device is basicly a basket with mechanical feet under it. There would also be lithium-ion batteries, 4 core ARM processor, 2 cameras for stereoscopic 3d-scanning and other things. The feet would be aluminum or fiberglass with electric motors or linear actuators attached. Walking is more energy efficient than flying. Good enough for hikers to rent walking devices that carry their tents, food and water 100 kilometers off-road. Good enough for telecom companies to transport solar-powered link stations.

Participation in our elections is a privilege that must be safeguarded against tampering.5/ Expel all foreign lobbying organizations from the U.S., including AIPAC. Our politicians must serve Americans, not foreign interests.6/ Our tax policy must incentivize birthrates and family creation. Increase tax credits for having children and raise taxes slightly on the top 1-5% of earners.7/ End all foreign wars and bring our troops home. Our young men have no business dying in useless wars overseas.8/ Back to immigration: end birthright citizenship and require at least one citizen parent for citizenship. Follow the Japanese citizenship method.9/ Immediate, swift, but humane deportation for all illegal immigrants. They have no reason to be here and must go back home.10/ Increase apprenticeship and vocational education programs as high school/college alternatives. Stop wasting students' time on unproductive garbage.11/ End military aid to belligerent nations like Israel and Saudi Arabia.

This leaves 4,042 flats which are neither owner-occupied nor rented privately - the article is unclear but the implication is that these ~4,000 flats are owned by the council and that the council is seeking to pass its portion of the cost of fitting sprinkler system onto council tenants.The council is almost certainly the head leaseholder of the blocks in question. Normally, this would mean they could compel the people who bought flats from them in the blocks to contribute their share to essential work such as this, but if those leases were badly drawn up the council may be in a sticky spot.

To this end, it ensures that American investors have effective remedies in the event of a breach of their rights, while **reforming the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system by providing for tools to dismiss frivolous claims and instituting a range of other procedural andsubstantive safeguards.**Note: \"Reforming the investor state dispute settlement (ISDS)\". It already tells us that ISDS already exist without the TPP, and that it would be improved by the TPP. Don't believe it? Go read up on the other trade agreements. All of them contain investment protection mechanisms.The investment protection mechanism aims to,1. Providing for national treatment (i.e., treatment no less favorable than aTPP country provides, in like circumstances, to its own investors or investments);and most-favored-nation treatment (i.e., treatment no lessfavorable than a TPP country provides, in like circumstances, to anothercountry\u2019s foreign investors or investments).2. Providing a \u201cminimum standard of treatment\u201d for investments, definednarrowly based on customary international law, including protectionsagainst denial of justice and failure to provide police protection.3. Ensuring that if a TPP government expropriates an investment, it doesso for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, andsubject to prompt, adequate and fully realizable and transferable compensation.4. Allowing for transfer of funds related to an investment covered underthe agreement\u2014such as contributions to capital, transfers of profits anddividends, payments of interest or royalties, and payments under a contract\u2014to be made freely and without delay, subject to exceptions. Theseexceptions ensure that governments retain the flexibility to managevolatile capital flows, including permitting countries to impose non-discriminatingtemporary safeguard measures (i.e., capital controls) restrictinginvestment-related transfers in the context of a balance ofpayments crisis, and certain other economic crises, or in the context ofprudential measures to protect the integrity and stability of the financialsystem.5. Barring specified \u201cperformance requirements,\u201d including local contentrequirements, export requirements, and technology transfer or technologylocalization requirements.6. Ensuring investors have the ability to appoint senior managers withoutregard to nationality, and ensuring that any nationality-based restrictionson the appointment of board members do not impair an investor\u2019scontrol over its investment.It also prevents shell company abuses,* The Investment chapter allows a TPP Party to deny benefits to \u201cshell companies\u201downed by persons of that Party or a non-Party that establishes inanother TPP country in order to take advantage of treaty rights but that lacksubstantial business activities in that country. It also allows the denial ofbenefits to companies that invest in a TPP country, but are owned by personsof non-Parties with whom a TPP Party prohibits certain transactions,such as under sanctions regimes.On the ISDS' new improvements,* At the same time, the chapter includes **stronger safeguards to closeloopholes and to raise the standards** of **investor-State dispute settlementabove virtually all of the other 3,200 plus investment-related agreements ineffect around the world.** These include underscoring that **countries can regulatein the public interest, including on health, safety, financial stability, andenvironmental protection; expanding the rules discouraging and dismissingfrivolous suits; clarifying that the claimant bears the burden to prove all elementsof its claims**; allowing governments to issue binding interpretations ofthe agreement; **making proceedings fully open and transparent**; and **providingfor the participation of civil society organizations and others parties nota direct party to the dispute**. In addition, the chapter will for the first timeclarify key concepts in the non-discrimination and minimum standard of treatment obligations, for example, clarifying the significance of legitimate public welfare objectives in the non-discrimination analysis and addressingthe concern that frustrating investor expectations in and of itself could resultin a minimum standard of treatment claim. The chapter will also requirethe Parties to provide detailed guidance on arbitrator ethics and issues ofarbitrator independence and impartiality.Note: The TPP's ISDS agreement has standards that are higher than over 3,200 other investment agreements (which also contain their own ISDS clauses, in outdated and more exploitable forms.)On whether countries have the rights to enact laws aimed at protecting the public health (e.g. against tobacco) and environment (e.g. taxes on pollutants),* Explicit language underscoring right to regulate in the public interest.**TPP includes new language underscoring that countries retain theright to regulate in the public interest, including to protect public health,safety, financial stability, and the environment**. TPP will also include aseparate, **explicit recognition of health authorities\u2019 right to adopt tobaccocontrol measures in order to protect public health.**Note: Tobacco control measures, environmental and health protection legislation are explicitly declared to be acceptable.* A new provision in TPP clarifies that the claimant\u2014the investor bringing the case against the government\u2014bears theburden to prove all elements of its claims, including claims of breachof the minimum standard of treatment (MST) obligation, an obligationwhich guarantees investors due process and certain other protections inaccordance with customary international law.* TPP expands existing rules **discouragingfrivolous suits by permitting governments to seek expedited review anddismissal of claims that are \u201cmanifestly without legal merit.**\u201d* TPP explicitly clarifies that aninvestor cannot win a claim for breach of the MST obligation merelyby showing that a government measure frustrated its expectations (forexample, its expectations of earning certain profits).You can read the TPP full text [here](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text)No, I don't work for the TPP people.

Then my dad took him in to get his claws removed because \"The damn cat is scratching up the couch\". He got my cat mutilated so he could keep the quality of his *furniture*. George was ok for a couple years, but then he started doing weird stuff. He stopped going to the bathroom in the litter box, but would poop RIGHT outside it. Whenever he'd go into the cat box, he would cry. My dad was just getting more and more annoyed at him, and then I finally convinced him to take George to the vet. So apparently when you rip out the bones for the declawing, the hole in the flesh was never filled up with scar tissue. It just stays empty. And every time he would try to use the litter box, more and more sand would jam itself into the hole. I watched the vets clean out **2 years worth** of litter jammed into his paw. I felt awful, he was such a good, loving cat, and he was in constant pain and couldn't tell us. We ended up changing his litter to some cardboard stuff, but the damage had already been done. He refused to go to the bathroom in the litter box anymore. My dad waited for me to leave home one day to take him to the pound because he just didn't want to deal with George anymore.

We were told by the breeder that she had some aggression issues, but the times we got to spend with her while making our decision she was the cuddliest little angel compared to the others.  Little did we know.2 weeks after taking her home we got our first taste of it.  She will sometimes go into this complete rage towards my gf.  Sometimes its random, usually when my gf is doing something she doesn't like (pacing, crying, raising her voice to me [god it's hilarious when she attacks her for yelling at me though]).  Other times it's completely random, cuddling on the couch straight into huge pupil murder mode.  Never attacks me though, even thoughWe debated on declawing at that point.  Gf thought it was unethical and I was scared of the risks.  My cat growing up walked a bit funny because it was declawed later in life (before my parents adopted it).  We did our research though, and weighed the factors of this behavior continuing and what it would mean for our future kids.  We opted to have her claws laser removed when she was still just 14 weeks old to reduce the risk of complication.  We found the best vet in Illinois that we could.  They explained that declawing used to be done with something like a cigar cutter, and if related to the human hand took off past the first knuckle.  Then there was scalpel, the most common now, that took slightly less of the finger.  And then there was laser which didn't need to take the first knuckle.  It was waaayyy more expensive, but if we were going to do it nothing but the absolute best was even an option.It turned out to be a good decision.  She still has her random tantrums where she'll attack my gf.  And she has very little patience for my 2 nephews that like to follow her around.  If she had her claws I would have had to give her up when baby time came.  And that's a far harsher thing than most on here would like to admit.  75% chance she would either bounce between a few more homes in her life or be put down.  Something I couldn't imagine doing to something I love so dearly. She's also a very active cat, loves to sprint around the house basically parkouring off everything (especially kitchen cabinets).  None of that would have been allowed if she still had her claws.  So for those saying just \"train your cat better\", what you're really saying is to break your cats natural personality to better suit your way of life.Lastly, there are those that will say that if I wasn't prepared to never declaw a cat then I never should have gotten one.  To which fuck you.  My cat's one of the most loved and happy creatures on the planet.  We see to every want and need she'll ever have or think of having.  We even take her on walks so that she gets to enjoy outdoors a bit, since were not willing to trust she won't be eaten by one of the 2 packs of coyotes around here if we let her out on her own.  She'll live in the same loving and stimulating house for the rest of her life, which is one of the best things a cat can have in this time of wild overpopulation.Tl:Dr got my cat declawed and she's all the more capable of being her own wild self around anything.

And these NFL players have used their platform to bring the issue to light. Especially to people who don't see themselves as part of the problem, but who have developed an apathetic mentality  towards the issue due to the fact that it doesn't affect them personally. But when it comes to kneeling, people are upset. They are upset about an action that doesn't change the actions of the game, doesn't change the amount of time to the game, nor affect their personal life. But they are bothered because they came to be 'entertained' and not preached to. This protest has become inconvenient to them. And it 'offends' them.  Because somehow, to them, nationalism is put on a higher plane than being empathetic to the plights of those who are less fortunate and discriminated against.  Dehumanization at its finest. But the channel can be changed, the TV can be turned off, and life goes on for those who were 'inconvenienced'. However, for those that are affected, they can't turn off their skin color. They can't turn off how they are viewed, and judged by others. They can't turn off the stereotypes or the ways they are negatively impacted by a society built around a racial caste system.So in the end... who is REALLY being inconvenienced?  You, who saw someone take a knee? Or the ones who despite their economical status as athletes, celebrities, businessmen, etc... STILL have to be reminded in negative ways that they are still minorities and not viewed as equals in our society.

He picks the baggie up and goes back to the wallet and could be saying to his partner that it could have fallen out of said wallet when it was first removed from the suspect and thrown on the ground.It would be nice to have more footage showing events even further back. If we can look at the video in a non-bias manner, then it can be a very real possibility. It's sad that all police seem to have the corrupt stigma and that so many use it. I see a lot of people talking about how all police are corrupt, and automatically assume these cops are as well. Again, I'm not defending them, but asking people to look at a situation without letting their opinion cloud their reasoning. Going into the subject and watching the video with the mindset of \"all cops are corrupt and evil\" is just as bad as someone having an encounter with a black person and thinking \"all black people steal and stink\" or \"all asians can't drive and beat women\" or any other ignorant stereotype/assumption. When we allow ourselves to tack on a stigma, it impairs our judgment, which in turn taints the entire situation. I'd ask that people rewatch the video, try and look at it from a differing opinion and see if it holds water. This applies to every other video where we constantly see people using wild assumptions or whatnot to be the core reasoning for all arguments or debates.Anyways, not trying to call anyone out, and I've only seen this article about this specific event.
