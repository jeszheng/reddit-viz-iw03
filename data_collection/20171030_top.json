Send it to your rep!If we all do it, it will be one long, continuous whisper into the ear of a system we ultimately control that says if the system doesn\u2019t start changing to reflect our actually held values as Americans, there will be consequences.To strengthen this voice and give it the power to exercise consequences\u2014we must all vote and it should occur on a weekend when more folks have the opportunity to vote at a minimum.

Taxes pay for everything, you want streets to use? Public streets are built using taxes. You want the police to make sure that the strongest or most well armed people can't just kill you and take your stuff? Taxes finance that. You want an army to defend your country? A legal system? People taking care of politics? A billion other things that make sure you can live your life in peace and follow your dreams? Yup, that costs money.So where do we get that? Privatizing everything and letting the free market solve everything? Then remember, for every dollar you pay for something that you use there's a certain amount of money the owner gets. So street building is privatized? You now pay to use them and though you don't have to pay the tax for it you pay an amount that makes building the street pay of + an amount of additional money rolling into the pockets of the owner. Private hospital? You pay the money that the treatment costs including costs of the personnel + an amount of money rolling to the owner. And it would be like that with everything. So no, it's not cheaper on the common person, it will mean you pay more for everything.Then to the other question, why should rich people pay more, is that not unfair? Not really, and I don't mean because they still have more even if they pay higher top brackets (most people don't understand tax brackets, too. If you have a top bracket of 50% the people don't pay 500k tax on 1m income) or the fact that the rich people use the ressources of the country to get that rich and should want to give back or the fact that americans always call themselves patriotic and that would include trying to improve america as a whole or all of the other arguments that are more emotional than purely factual, but this:Who gains the most out of the tax spendings? If you are just a poor person scraping to get by, how probable is it that, if we had no police, you get targetted by criminals looting your building? I mean maybe once, then you have nothing left and people would leave you alone. How many people would target the ultra rich if there was a lawless world? Probably a fuckton. So they actually have more use of the police keeping them safe. And that should be worth something to them.Who needs a national infrastructure more, the guy who just goes to work every day or the guy who owns that company, making the money out of the fact that he can use the infrastructure to move goods? That is worth way more to the people using the infrastructure excessively than it is to the people living in their little town and maybe do a vacation once a year.Basically everything the state does will be of higher worth to big corporations and, thus, to people with massive income, than it is to the common people. And that should be worth a lot to them.So throw this idea that taxing rich people higher is a bad thing out of the window. They get way more out of that deal than the common people do, so the common people shouldn't be the ones to shoulder the weight for it.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 55993, "comment_id": "dp35ner", "score": 22, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 30 10:40:55 2017", "ups": 22}, {"body": "Donald Trump still needs to learn how to wear a fucking tie.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 557898, "comment_id": "dp2t3c0", "score": 19, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 30 03:49:37 2017", "ups": 19}, {"body": "Taxes and debt are democracy instruments to line the pockets of billionaires through ever increasing public debt.

[*Source Data 1*](https://goo.gl/QHgRQa), [*Source Data 2*](https://goo.gl/xAKRq1) and [*Article for Context*](https://goo.gl/o3PZ6W)Donald Trump could go on a stage and start shouting about raising the minimum wage, increasing taxes on the wealthy, allowing more immigrants into the country, and combating climate change. His supporters would cheer and shout, and would all suddenly support liberal policies. It's not a party of principles--it's a party of sheep. And the data suggest that \"both sides\" aren't the same in this regard. Republicans are significantly more guilty.#Caveats and Considerations:Yes, the exhibits above paint a one-sided picture. I posit that this is because *the reality truly is one-sided*. However, there are several things to keep in mind.* Democrats *are not immune* to this effect. **But the degree to which they display it seems to be significantly less**. Several of the exhibits above (e.g. 11, 15, and 16) demonstrate this. Democrats do sometimes react in this manner when their party takes power, but the reaction from Republicans under similar circumstances seems to be notably larger. It would be interesting to do a meta-analysis of these studies and compare the trend of swing among Democrats to the swing among Republicans.* There were several circumstances under which I omitted graphs from this list. I omitted graphs which were **not relevant**. I omitted graphs that **I could not source**. I omitted graphs that **did not show either side reacting more strongly than the other side**.* There are [indications](https://osf.io/dwscm/) that certain demographics which tend to lean Democrat had strong negative feelings of health/well-being immediately after the 2016 election. It is very important to note that there was no data collected about party affiliation in this study, and it is only conjecture that the groups discussed are likely to lean left. It is also entirely likely that their change in well-being wasn\u2019t a result of party identity, but broader societal fears regarding discrimination, etc.* In the course of building this list, I have found only one graph that showed Democrats reacting strongly to their own party gaining power, while Republicans mostly held their ground. [**Here it is**](https://i.imgur.com/AOoddHZ.png): Democrats developed a more positive outlook on the US succeeding in Iraq after Obama took office. Republicans were comparatively consistent. [*Source Data*](https://goo.gl/xVsEdC). However, this comes with its own caveat: after the 2008 election, many people with strong anti-war convictions [stopped identifying with the Democratic party](https://i.imgur.com/RMRnygX.png). [*Source Data*](https://goo.gl/kNt2oY).* To that last point, the biggest potential criticism of the List of Exhibits is that the trends may not be driven by changes of opinion, but by changes in party affiliation. However, if the data in Exhibit 8 are to be trusted, this would seem *not* to be the case. Instead, the stronger someone identifies with the party, the more likely they are to willingly change their positions to be in line with their leadership. Furthermore, at least regarding data gathered since January 2017, it looks like there\u2019s been little shift in party identity (until October, at least): [Page 14 of this Fox poll](https://goo.gl/Lq3Yuq)", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 93488, "comment_id": "dp3nlgg", "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 30 18:02:43 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "The laughing from the reporters just after Sanders left says it all really.

He is vying for control of Prepa with the federal oversight board installed by Congress to supervise Puerto Rico\u2019s economic planning. The oversight board last week took steps last week to install a retired Air Force colonel as a \u201cchief transformation officer\u201d to take over Prepa\u2019s operations.>The governor said he would oppose the change and that management of public corporations such as Prepa should rest exclusively with local officials appointed under Puerto Rican law. The judge overseeing the bankruptcy process is expected to decide who should be in charge.>**The Whitefish contract had terms that precluded government agencies from auditing certain profit and cost elements and provided compensation for linemen that critics on the island said were in excess of typical rates, even considering the rugged working conditions in remote regions of Puerto Rico.**>Whitefish has defended its work and said that without its quick arrival to the island, utility crews would only now be getting there to begin restoration work.>Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said Sunday he would reactivate mutual aid agreements with utilities from Florida and New York that Prepa initially chose not to tap after the storm in favor of private contractors.>A Whitefish spokesman said Sunday it was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the governor\u2019s decision to shred the contract, arguing that bringing in replacement brigades would only delay restoring power to the majority of Prepa customers who still lack service.>FEMA said Friday it hadn\u2019t confirmed whether it considered Whitefish\u2019s prices to be reasonable and hadn\u2019t yet provided any reimbursement for the contract. **FEMA said it hadn\u2019t authorized Whitefish\u2019s payment terms, despite language in the contract stating the terms had been approved for reimbursement by the agency.**>**Mr. Ramos told The Wall Street Journal the language should have been removed from the contract but was left in by mistake.**>\u201c**That\u2019s civil fraud without any doubt**,\u201d said John Mudd, a Puerto Rico-based attorney who represents government contractors in court proceedings. \u201cIf the contract is canceled and these people are not paid,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can claim that they were defrauded.\u201d>Prepa based its decision on the contract rates, the time it would take for crews to mobilize and the fact that Whitefish didn\u2019t require a large upfront payment, Mr. Ramos said. He said that to his knowledge there was no outside influence on his procurement department and that Prepa structured the deal so money would be released in tranches of between $1 million and $3 million as work was completed.>But Mr. Ramos also acknowledged that the contracting process was rushed due to the emergency circumstances and that Prepa didn\u2019t receive certain protections, including a performance bond.>If FEMA determines the contract to be non-reimbursable for failing to comply with agency requirements, Prepa could be stuck with the bill for a month\u2019s worth of work by Whitefish, Mr. Mudd said.>Whitefish signed a deal framework on Sept. 26, less than a week after Maria made landfall. It was amended on Oct. 17, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.>In an Oct. 21 letter seeking assistance from Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Mr. Rossello said that \u201crestoring electricity to our citizens has become a daunting task, mainly because of the lack of liquidity of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.\u201d>Mr. Scott, a Republican, said Monday he will lead a delegation of the state\u2019s utility providers to the island Friday.", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 27760, "comment_id": "dp3nml1", "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 30 18:03:16 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Please get Zinke!", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 67868, "comment_id": "dp3l8m1", "score": 15, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 30 17:22:02 2017", "ups": 15}, {"body": "The FBI has it's handful dealing with Trump.

The Campaign Supervisor added: \"Great work.\"So whoever the campaign supervisor is, they obviously were aware that one of their lower-level staffers was engaging with individuals who claimed to be representatives of the Russian leadership, and not only failed to discourage such interaction, but actually encouraged it.>On or about March 31, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS attended a \"national security meeting\" in Washington D.C., with then-candidate Trump and other foreign policy advisors for the Campaign.

S.1989, the recently introduced, so-called \u201cHonest Ads Act,\u201d likely will feature prominently. The bill is being sold \u201cfirst and foremost [as addressing] an issue of national security.\u201d  >  > But unless Americans exercising their First Amendment rights is now \u201can issue of national security,\u201d the bill and its sponsors are not being honest about its effects. With Americans bearing 99.99 percent of its regulatory impact, the \u201cHonest Ads Act\u201d is a sledgehammer for a problem better addressed with a scalpel.  >  > According to the bill\u2019s own legislative findings and its sponsors\u2019 remarks, more than $1.4 billion was spent on online political advertising last year. Of that amount, some $100,000 (less than 0.01 percent) has been reported thus far as coming from Russian interests. But S.1989 fails at even a perfunctory attempt to target foreign interference. Instead, the bill would almost entirely regulate Americans.  >  > S.1989 begins by undoing the Federal Election Commission\u2019s \u201cinternet exemption,\u201d under which online political speech generally is not regulated unless it is a \u201ccommunication placed for a fee on another person\u2019s website.\u201d The bill would impose a much broader standard, under which any \u201cpaid internet, or paid digital communication\u201d could be regulated.  >  > The change may appear subtle, but it makes a world of difference as groups making even minimal expenditures could be regulated for content on their own websites, blogs and mass emails. Indeed, the FEC regulated such things prior to its \u201cinternet exemption\u201d enlightenment. Videos that groups post on YouTube and anything they publish on Facebook and Twitter also possibly could be regulated under S.1989.  > > S.1989 next expands regulation of so-called \u201celectioneering communications\u201d to include online ads that refer to elected officials and candidates within certain pre-election periods. Again, this legislative rhetoric obfuscates reality. In fact, many \u201celectioneering communications\u201d are non-electoral issue advocacy. For example, in a case the Institute for Free Speech litigated under the existing \u201celectioneering communications\u201d law, a think tank\u2019s ads asking Coloradans to contact their senators about a pending criminal justice reform bill was held to be an election ad.  >  > At least under current law, only TV and radio ads targeted to those eligible to vote for the referenced candidates are \u201celectioneering communications.\u201d Despite the bill\u2019s legislative findings about the ability to microtarget internet ads, S.1989 would indiscriminately regulate online ads even when they are not targeted at eligible voters. Thus, ads inviting New Yorkers to contact House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) about the pending tax bill could be regulated, as could ads asking Texans to urge Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) to stop blocking judicial nominees.  >  > S.1989 also would effectively impose a new reporting requirement \u2014 on top of the existing FEC reporting burdens \u2014 for political and issue advertising costing as little as $500. A publicly accessible database would have to contain a copy of all regulated ads and details about how each ad was targeted, when it ran, the average rate charged, the candidate or \u201cnational legislative issue of public importance\u201d discussed, and information about the sponsor and its officers or board members.  >  > While broadcasters already are subject to a similar \u201cpublic file\u201d requirement, the economics and policy rationale for regulating costly broadcast advertising are quite different from those for regulating low-cost internet ads. The compliance costs, when combined with the liability that S.1989 would impose on online platforms for recordkeeping errors, may drive online advertising costs out of the reach of many small grassroots organizations. Sponsors of controversial causes, like \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or tea party groups, also may find themselves targets of retaliation by opponents using the \u201cpublic files\u201d to track their online activities.  >  > Facebook and Twitter have recently announced their own efforts to address foreign propaganda, which contain some practices similar to those mandated by S.1989. Nevertheless, these self-initiated measures are preferable to inflexible, one-size-fits-all legislation, as they can be adjusted and tailored over time to meet each platform\u2019s unique advertising program and changing foreign threats.  > > Additionally, Congress can update the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which specifically addresses foreign propaganda campaigns. Like S.1989, FARA requires disclaimers, periodic registration, and copies of foreign propaganda to be filed for public inspection. However, FARA only covers foreign interests acting through agents, as the law was written before a time when foreign interests could directly purchase internet advertising without any intermediary. This can be easily fixed, and unlike S.1989, amending FARA would not primarily regulate Americans.  >  > Foreign interference with our election campaigns is a serious issue, and the sponsors of S.1989 are doubtlessly well-intentioned. But instead of specifically addressing foreign interests, the bill would primarily regulate Americans\u2019 political speech rights, thereby making America look just a little bit more like Russia.  >  > *Eric Wang is a political law attorney and senior fellow at the Institute for Free Speech.*", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 4901, "comment_id": "dp3tdvz", "score": 521, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 30 19:41:24 2017", "ups": 521}, {"body": "This title is the epitome of clickbait", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author_comment_karma": 1950, "comment_id": "dp3siue", "score": 170, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 30 19:26:20 2017", "ups": 170}, {"body": "This title is quite misleading. This is not about net neutrality at all. This article is about requiring the disclosure of the source of funding for political advertisements on the internet and social media. If that surprises you, please re-read the article.These comments seems to imply that requiring these disclosures would somehow go against net-neutrality. If that is the case, can somebody explain to me how?I'm a strong proponent of net neutrality, but I don't see how it's incompatible with disclosing the financial source of political advertisements. Edit: Here's a summary of the bill in question: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s1989/summaryThe main argument of the article seems to be that there would be costs associated with complying with the new regulations, and those costs would be passed on to the organizations buying ads on internet platforms. They speculate that this would make internet advertising too expensive for grassroots organizations.I do not believe this is a likely outcome, as the burden of recording who is purchasing ads would fall on to the advertising platform companies, i.e. Google and Facebook. It's possible that there would be some additional marginal costs to these companies, but certainly not enough force them to raise prices significantly. This quote is specifically disturbing:   >Foreign interference with our election campaigns is a serious issue, and the sponsors of S.1989 are doubtlessly well-intentioned. But instead of specifically addressing foreign interests, the bill would primarily regulate Americans\u2019 political speech rights, thereby making America look just a little bit more like Russia.The bill regulates *advertising platforms* that operate in America, not the *advertisements* themselves. Groups would still be able to advertise whatever political position they want, they would simply need to also put their name on it, just like on TV ads where they say \"Paid for by the so-and-so organization for political stuff\".

High speed broadband internet and online streaming were/are a threat to his shitty Foxtel cable television business model. Foxtel got away with charging high prices for shitty packaged content that also contained advertisements, however, Netflix arrived on the scene and started to offer cheap content sans advertisements and you could watch what you want, where ever and when ever. Rupert Murdoch then had dinner with former conservative prime Minister Tony Abbott so that he could lobby Abbott and the conservatives. In return Murdoch pumps out propaganda for them like this and his papers can praise the conservative's inferior broadband network and pour scorn on Labor's superior version of the National Broadband Network. https://mitchellflanagan.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/vguibw.jpghttp://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/prime-minister-tony-abbott-takes-rupert-murdochs-advice-20150128-130intFormer prime minister, Kevin Rudd (Labor Party), made similar comments the other day in his AMA when he stated:*I note in passing that the position adopted by the conservatives in the 2013 election seems to have been identical with that preferred by News Limited. It's I think a matter of historical record that News Limited did not want the National Broadband Network; that News Limited did not want fibre optic to the premises. And the reason they didn't want that was because it would provide direct competition to the Foxtel cable television network in this country from service delivery companies like Netflix. And so, mysteriously, by some act of God, the Liberal Party found itself adopting the same position as Mr Murdoch. I wonder why?*Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and their conservative party have wasted billions of dollars on sabotaging (for political reasons) the previous government's mostly fibre optic national broadband network so they can replace it with an inferior and outdated mix of copper wire broadband technologies which they claim would be done sooner and cheaper. However, it's behind schedule, over budget and using outdated tech. The conservatives claim that \"the adults are back in charge\" and \"sound economic management is in our DNA\" but they're full of shit. Their version of the National Broadband Network is a huge reeking pile of shit that has done a huge disservice to Australia and its people and the damage will be felt for a long time.

Keep that in mind or at least don't feel the need to point it out to me, I'm fully aware :)So in 2008, I was dating a girl whose family had recently moved to the U.S. from S. Africa (I think in 2004). They left behind some family members and a lot of friends and they all but gave up their farm, I think the grandmother who stayed held onto part of it. In any case, I remember the stories she was telling me from back home. Things were getting pretty bad. I guess the farms were constantly raided by men from Zimbabwe mostly and they had to keep fully armed security staff on at all times. Even then that didn't seem to matter. I remember one time when she was really upset. One of her friend's farms had been raided and her friend was raped and killed. She missed SA and often spoke highly of it but she had said ever since the end of Apartheid things had gone really bad for white people there. The government didn't do anything to protect them and they were left to fend for themselves. I spent a lot of time with her, a lot of time she was crying about news she had heard from back home. I had dated victims of rape and assault in the past but this one felt entirely different. It's powerfully moving to hear someone tell you a story about their homeland and how it's all gone to hell. I was very interested in her stories and I think that's why I relationship was so strong, I constantly had something I was very interested in to know about and she had someone who wanted to listen to her and be there for her. She literally gave me a tour through hundreds of stories and photos. I learned a little Afrikaans (a language I didn't even know existed, I thought they spoke English or some African tribal language in the rural parts)Now, of course, all of us were raised and told how evil Apartheid was so the first reaction I had and I imagine many of you will have was \"well that's what they get\" or something of a sense of \"comeuppance\". I don't know if my empathy for those that suffered under apartheid could justify the things being done in return though, or even rationalize. Either way, I clicked on this article because it immediately reminded me of her. The family wasn't hurting but they had clearly gone from having money to having to work 9-5's and they didn't seem bitter or racist. They blamed the government, not black people. They blamed raiders, not black people. Some of those clearly overlapped but I never got the sense they were racist, and at the time I was VERY VERY liberal so I think I would have picked up on the slightest. I know I was definitely keeping some comments in check as she related the stories to me, because, as I said, I think my knee-jerk reaction was to blame the white people of SA for creating their own misery in the end. But it's different when you're talking to an actual victim of something, especially in person. Maybe that's more of what Reddit needs. It's easy to judge from behind a screen or some when you view someone as nothing more than a paragraph of text. I ended up leaving the town we met as I was just ending my time in the Army and I was moving back home. We lost touch but I often fondly remember her and the things she taught me.
