They leave off hobbies as they didn't realize the 10 hours a week they spent on independent art projects could count as an extracurricular. They don't mention their family obligations, such as having to take care of their 4 younger siblings for many hours each day as their single mom works two jobs. For more insight on what might count on your college app, [see my post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6eg8jq/what_you_should_do_if_you_have_no_extracurricular/).- They underestimate hours spent on an extracurricular activity. While it is obviously bad to lie/exaggerate your hours, it's not good to underestimate them, either! Last year I worked with an Olympic athlete on her applications. In looking at her original list of extracurricular activities, she had included 15 hours/week as an estimate for her commitment to her sport. I was surprised to hear how low of a time commitment that was, and she remarked \"Oh, well, my mom and I have to travel, like, 4 hours roundtrip every day just to get to practice.\" 4 HOURS EACH DAY!? Add that significant travel time to your activities list, girl! If you, too, have an activity that requires travel time, you **can** include that time in your estimated hours/week time commitment on your applications. [Check out my guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6lx32y/how_to_write_your_common_app_and_uc_activities/) to the activities list for more tips like this.- They get generic letters of recommendation, or they pick a teacher that doesn't add a lot of value to their application. Most top universities want two letters of recommendation from teachers: one from a STEM teacher and one from humanities. Ideally, these teachers are from a student's junior year or had the student for multiple classes/years at school. Further, many teachers use a template to write their letters of recommendation so most letters of rec are very generic. They include stuff like \"she was a good class contributor\" or \"he will excel in college\" without any concrete details as to why\u2014as most teachers are **not** paid to write letters of rec, must write a lot of them, and take shortcuts to churn out letters in time for the deadline. To get good letters of recommendation, it is key that your teacher personalizes the letter. Ideally, they'll also compare you to your peers. For example, \"He is the single most driven student I have met in my 10 year career, and he is absolutely determined to accomplish his dreams of XYZ\" or \"She is the brightest math student I teach across all my 7 classes this year,\" etc. How to get those sort of letters of rec? Send them a letter with detailed examples and anecdotes from your time in class! You can download my [guide to getting good letters of rec](http://www.helpwithapps.com/store/p9/lettersofrec) for more tips.- Their essays are generic, too, because they fail to include how they think, feel, or view the world differently as a result of their experiences. I cannot tell you how many students' essays I've read that talk about football or piano or their research position and just gives an A to Z guide of their participation in the activity. Do you know how many other students have done the same activities? These essays all blend together and tell us little about YOU other than what we could have already gleaned from your activities list. One of my favorite essays from recent years started as just an essay about the student's participation in orchestra. After a lot of 1-on-1 brainstorming and revisions, the student wrote an excellent essay starting with really cool imagery about the origami artwork hanging from her bedroom ceiling before transitioning into her hobbies. She wrote something like, \"Just as distinctly different are the [origami shape 1] and [origami shape 2] hanging above my head are my passions for [activity 1] and [music]\u2014but they both hang in my heart.\" It was more well-written than that, but I'm pulling from the dregs of my memory. The essay turned out awesome, was super reflective of how the student thought, felt, or viewed the world differently as a result of her experiences and interests, and she's currently at an Ivy League university\u2014in part because she wrote an essay at the Ivy League level.- Many universities (UChicago, Penn, Michigan, Columbia, Brown, Yale, Stanford, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, etc.) ask \"Why our college?\" or a combo between \"Why our college?\" and \"Why your major?\" BE SPECIFIC. I cannot tell you how many essays I read for UChicago that were like \"When I visited your campus, it felt magical. I was surrounded by students who were so driven yet friendly. As I explored your biology major, I found great classes like organic chemistry and intro to biology, and I just knew that such a prestigious university would prepare me for medical school.\" BLAH BLAH BLAH\u2014all this could apply to **any** school! Be extremely, extremely specific. Research the school extensively. Find classes that the university offers that you haven't seen at any other school (o-chem doesn't cut it). Mention the curriculum (Core at UChicago or Columbia, Open Curriculum at Brown, for example), and don't just say you like it\u2014really dig into WHY that curriculum exists from a fundamental educational level and what sort of catalyst it will be for your own thinking. Search the school's online newspaper for some cool programs that other prospective students might not know about, talk to current students/alumni (if possible) and incorporate things that you learned. Ask them what underlying qualities the student body possesses (for UChicago, it's a thirst for knowledge, and at Georgetown, it might be some Jesuit value), and evidence your possession of those very same characteristics in your essay. Mention specific professors under whom you wish to study/research, and connect their classes/research back to your own intellectual interests. Better yet, email the professor, have an awesome conversation with them, and incorporate some element of that conversation in your essay. Don't think professors will give you the time of day? This strategy has worked for my 1-on-1 students at Stanford, UChicago, Yale, Princeton, Penn, and many more schools. You can [download my guide to emailing professors here](http://www.helpwithapps.com/store/p6/emailprofessors). Bottom line: If the essay can be copied and pasted to fit any other university, **be more specific**.If you have any questions, I'm all ears.

Write about yourself.  Who are you, what do you have to offer, what motivates you, who will you be one day?There's a story that the folks down at Rice tell when they're doing tours.  Their application has a little box in the middle of a page, with the instructions to fill the box with something unique that expresses why they should accept you.  Back in the 80s, some kid filled the box with glue and then dumped uncooked rice on it, so that there was just a rectangle of dry rice in the middle of the app.  They tell everyone this so that they know it has been done, and will result in your application being rejected immediately.Seriously.  The admissions people anywhere see a dozen apps a day that talk about how good the school is, or its history, or its alumni, etc.  They've seen all of it before, and none of that means a damn thing when it comes to what *you* will bring to the school.The objective of your average admissions department is to find students who will do two things: finish at least one degree, and become rich so they give back to the school someday in the future.  If you can convince your admissions officer that you're not going to drop out, and that you're going to make good use of your degree, they're going to want to bring you in.The first part is mostly a function of your grades and test scores.  If your stats look good, it's a fair bet that you'll finish your degree.  If you're worried about how your stats look, use the essay to explain that you faced some hardship, or convey an anecdote about how hard you worked on a project (be specific - explain what you were trying to do, what made it hard, how you eventually made it work, *and how it felt to complete it*).The second one is where the essay really comes in.  Unless you just wrote your essay about a hardship or hard work, then you want to write either about your love of a given subject, or about your dreams for the future and how you plan to achieve them using your degree in a given subject.If you really enjoy history, write an essay about what makes history so interesting to you, and explain your favorite obscure story about your favorite historical event.  As an example: the assassination of Franz Ferdinand is almost glossed over in most textbooks as an event that directly led to the first world war, but the [actual story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyCmh9G1fpo) of Young Bosnia's attempts to kill him, and Gavrilo Princip's eventual success, is one of the most interesting things about the war.  You only have about two pages, so you'd have to very carefully summarize, but there's not much better way to explain how a subject like history gets more interesting the deeper you dig into it.Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger.

They're under the same branch (enrollment mgmt) so we had to go to a lot of the same events/seminars.  At one point, we learned that some students don't realize that financial aid is a possibility for them. Students coming from difficult backgrounds at huge schools with maybe one guidance counselor per 100+ students don't get the help they need when applying. I definitely understand that a student might not see the point in telling the difficult story of their lives, but it can really help your chances. In many ways, all we have to go on to learn about you is that essay. If you've got average grades, no extracurriculars, and you write a generic essay about how you've always wanted to be in such-and-such career, you're less likely to be noticed.  Don't be afraid to personalize your application. If you let the admissions team know that you were working two jobs after school to help your family pay rent, that really says a lot about you. We can read between the lines and see that's why your application may not be stellar in other areas.  As a former billing counselor, I want to throw in some extra things here.  1. Don't be afraid to apply to your dream school just because you can't afford it. They may be able to give you more help than you realize.  2. That said, if you do get into your dream school, but the financial stars aren't aligning, really weigh your options before you take on that extra debt. You can transfer in from another school to save money (my college even specifically partnered with another and gave those students transfer aid [which typically wasn't a \"thing\"]). Really research your options. Some colleges (like mine, a private school) won't give aid to transfers, only those coming in as freshman. BUT, that could still mean savings in the end. Others are fine with transfer aid. And it's okay to ask them about it.  A DEGREE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT. I wish that I could have said this to every student and parent who cried to me that Private College I Worked At was their DREAM SCHOOL, and can't we *please* give them more financial aid?? (Edit: to be clear, I'm not mocking them. It was heartbreaking.) We didn't have more aid to give. Please, think about your future.

A few years ago, my then boyfriend and I were drinking, and decided to go on a sexy, late night field trip for some outdoor shenanigans. It was just after halloween, our favourite holiday. That year, he had gone as Satan, but he really did it up: digitigrade boots that gave him goat feet he had crafted the previous year to go as Pan, red body paint, horns, realistic claws glued over his nails, the whole deal. He was a huge drinker, and made his own wine, so he had made this extremely realistic nuclear warhead suitcase wine caddy. It's amazing. Light up countdown display, working keys, toggles, numerical keypad. He printed up stickers to put on it. It looked real as fuck. We packed a blanket, lube, my favourite vibrator, and the nuke filled with some travellers. We found a park nearby, and stumbled through it until we found a nice, private spot under a tree, and spread out the blanket. He went down on me, and I was trying to keep the noise level down, but can be very demonstrative at times. I love forest sex or any kind of outdoor naked activities, so I was really turned on. He made me cum about 7 times in a row, then suddenly stopped and said, \"get dressed, we gotta get out of here.\" He had excellent spidey sense when it came to the autorities, so I didn't question him. We put on our clothes, gathered up our stuff and were almost ready to leave when we hear the crackle of radio chatter. We both dropped down behind the tree, but I was wearing all white that day, so the 2 cops spotted us almost instantly. The cops came around both sides of the tree, and one of them said, \"Were having some noise complaints from the condo on the other side of that fence,\" he pointed to the bushes next to us, and sure enough, there was a fence that separated the park from the grounds of an apartment complex. \"They said it sounded like there was a woman giving birth in the park.\" \"Um, yeah, we were just leaving. Sorry bout that.\" we said, redfaced, starting to gather our things.\"No worries. We'll just escort you ou-freeze! Hands up! Don't touch that briefcase! Slowly stand up, and back away from the bomb, with your hands on your heads! Now\" Both cops drew their weapons. My boyfriend and I, hands in the air, are like, \"Whoa! It's not real!\"  My boyfriend starts to explain: \"Its a prop from halloween! Check it out! It's a wine carrier!\" One of the cops holsters his weapon and slowly approaches the \"bomb\". He opens it up, and sees the bottle of wine nestled amongst the wires, batteries, and boards that power the display. \"Omg, check this out!\" he says to his partner, who puts his gun away to step forward and have a look. \"It looks so real!\" My boyfriend starts proudly showing the cops how it works, telling them how he made it, and why, and getting them to read the stickers pasted on the outside. The cops were impressed. After they're all done dorking out over my boyfriend's rad creation, and I'm done my mini heart attack, they escorted us to the street. They warned us about getting frisky in public, also telling us to be careful where we brought \"the bomb\". I don't know if it was the outdoor head, the almost getting caught in the act, or having guns drawn on us...maybe all three? When we got home, I was INSATIABLE. We must have fucked for *hours* after, I can barely remember it. That wine was really strong. My bf said he had never seen me like that. I was sore for *days* after. It was awesome.

My bf is of the opinion that I\u2019m \u201chot\u201d, his co-workers seem to agree and says he punches above his weight. It is incredibly difficult for me to wrap my head around anyone thinking me that attractive. I usually just laugh it off, and I do not agree that my bf is punching above his weight. :pAs a final note, I\u2019m quite curious about the looks of the people posting similar stuff here.

I'm a phlebotomist for a blood bank (not the Red Cross though) and I'll tell you the same thing I tell all of my first time donors:You fucking rock, dude. Even just having the idea of coming in and donating is awesome and I'm so proud of people like you. I have been doing this for quite a while and I always get excited when I have a first time donor. It's fun! With one unit of whole blood, you've saved two to three people today. That's amazing! Some tips for other first timers: Eat well before hand. Having something in your stomach helps tremendously. 9 times out of 10, when someone has a reaction, they'll admit to not eating before hand. Drink a ton of water, too, especially if you don't always drink water. It really helps with feeling well, but it also helps blood flow and makes the donation quicker. I know it's hard, but try not to think about it. Bring a book, play on your phone, have a friend to talk to. I don't care. But the more nervous you are, the rougher it gets. I like to chat with my first time donors during the donation but it isn't always possible. However, if you tell me you're super nervous, I'm going to go out of my way to make sure you're comfortable. Don't forget to squeeze the ball! If you have cold hands, ask for a hot pack. They're lovely. If something doesn't feel right, please speak up. This is super important. I don't know what you're feeling, and sometimes I can tell by looking at you that something is wrong, but not always. If the needle hurts when it's in the vein, that's wrong. If you're feeling fuzzy or your hearing just got wonky, that's not right. The quicker you tell me, the quicker I'll be able to fix it. If you have had bad experiences with phlebotomist before or if you have bad veins or if you're just uncomfortable with the whole idea, don't be afraid to let your phlebotomist know. A good phlebotomist won't be offended, and a really good phlebotomist will make sure you're comfortable 100% of the process. When you're done, sit up slowly. Get used to being upright again before you stand up. Dangle your legs over the side of your chair. Take your time. There is no rush! Don't bend over and stand up suddenly. If you drop something, have someone else pick it up for you. Stick around for the full 15 minutes, and grab a snack. Something salty is preferable, to replace the 150mg of sodium that you lost. A whole blood donation burns 600 calories, so eat a big meal the day of your donation. Your body deserves the extra care. You guys are awesome and I'm so proud of all you blood donors. For what it's worth, everyone involved in the blood industry loves what they do and loves being involved with it. (At least, all of the ones I've worked with, but again, I don't work for the Red Cross) You really are making a difference in someone's life and we appreciate it so much! I love working with you all and hope you all have wonderful experiences donating blood. Editing this to say holy good god guys I did not expect gold. Thank you! If anyone ever has any questions about donating blood or anything that happens in the blood industry, let me know! It's my favorite thing in the world and I love to share. You guys fucking rock.

The first is a true weakness that has nothing to do with the job at hand. Example: If you are interviewing for a data entry position, say that you haven\u2019t given many presentations within a professional setting and consider yourself a nervous public speaker, that it\u2019s something you welcome from a professional development standpoint, but it\u2019s not something you would consider a strength at this point. I like this one because it is relatable and sometimes gets a chuckle from the hiring manager, or even a \u201cme too.\u201dThe second takes finesse and confidence, because if you ramble too much, you can actually dig yourself into a hole. But you can provide an example of a true weakness and the steps you put into place to overcome it. Example: Time management used to be a real issue for me. I had a job with several different responsibilities that all needed attending to within the day. I recognized that I was struggling to complete them all, so I started scheduling every minute of my day and stuck to it. I also put xyz other steps into place, etc. it\u2019s still something I pay attention to to make sure I stay on track, but I no longer struggle as I did before. If all else fails, if you\u2019re interviewing for entry level roles, the strength disguised as a weakness technique will do. Example: I\u2019m a perfectionist, I\u2019m hard on myself when I make a mistake, I bounce back but I could ease up a little in that area. It\u2019ll get a nod and a wink from the hiring manager as they know it\u2019s not a true weakness, but they\u2019re really just asking to see if you\u2019ll say something stupid like \u201cI had trouble getting along with my boss in my last job.\u201d", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 239, "stickied": false, "score": 17, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 17:54:09 2017", "ups": 17}, {"body": "you love to work independently and sometimes find it challenging to delegate work out to others", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 425, "stickied": false, "score": 18, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 20:04:28 2017", "ups": 18}, {"body": "Depends on the job.

I home life was never ok so i never, ever, had anyone over. My home life wasn't perfect, parents argued constantly. Dad was neglectful, literally we wouldn't talk at all growing up unless it was for dinner or he needed something. Never asked \"how are you\" \"how's school\" or anything. The guy just wasn't there emotionally. It's infuriating because he fed me , clothed me and put a roof over my head which in his mind makes him a good father. Mom was judgmental , just awful. Both are still like this. Add a cramped apartment and i just couldn't deal. My friends lives all looked good. Not perfect but normal. I never felt normal. I always wanted to hide my upbringing and i did so by never inviting anyone over. I feel this deep shame over not being good enough. Not having a big empty house to throw parties at. Not having parents that openly cared. I know they tried, but i just never felt like i was enough. What sucks is that i still live in the same town and i see my old friends still as normal. I wanna date girls but the ones i like I'm afraid to approach. I wanna have friends over but there's nothing fun to do. I just feel this deep shame which has caused me to keep people at a distance. I'm just so fucking alone and it's all my fault! Despite all that, i know the shame is all in my head, my past doesn't define me. That's why I really wanna leave this town, i know i can be better. My worst fear is staying here forever (i know older people like that). How can i leave this place? Will i ever be normal?

Two different forms of your question:**1)** If you were to start walking from mean sea level (as defined as the average position of sea level at a given point over a several year period to account for tidal and storm variability) at a specific point to a specific mountain peak now vs 100 years from now, would the total vertical distance you travel be different?Generally, yes. Because the total mass of water in the ocean is increasing and the volume is also increasing via thermal expansion, mean sea level is rising (in most places, there are important local variations due to variations in gravity, bathymetry, and isostatic rebound in response to melting of glaciers/ice sheets) the total vertical distance between mean sea level and mountain peaks will decrease between now and 100 years from now.**2)** Will the elevation on maps of mountain peaks change between now and 100 years because of sea level rise?No (with a caveat). While conversationally people refer to topographic height as a value above 'mean sea level', unless you're referencing an old map, this is not really the case in that these elevations are not referenced directly to measurements of sea level. When describing a position, whether that's a horizontal or vertical position, this position needs to be referenced to something. This is equivalent to simple plotting in cartesian coordinates where everything is referenced to the origin. When talking about geographic/topographic coordinates, the reference points are called the [datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum). For heights, a [vertical datum](http://gisgeography.com/vertical-datum/) is what we're concerned with and you can see from that link that we can kind of think of three broad categories, 'tidal datums', 'ellipsoidal datums', and 'geodetic datums' (also sometimes called 'orthometric datums'). While a tidal datum is tied to actual measurements of mean sea level height in several areas, a geodetic datum is tied to a specific point, that may or may not coincide with a place where we have measured mean tidal heights. For a geodetic datum, heights are essentially [orthometric heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthometric_height), so heights above the [geoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid), which is an equipotential gravitational surface which represents what sea level would be if only influenced by gravity and earth's rotation, then referenced to our zero coordinate which is specific to that datum. Ellispoidal datums are reference heights to an ellipsoid, so a mathematical approximation of the shape of the earth without topography. There are [lots](https://community.esri.com/groups/coordinate-reference-systems/blog/2014/08/14/mean-sealevel) of different vertical datums that vary by place, for the US we currently use [North American Vertical Datum of 1988](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/vertical/) which is a geodetic datum. Because elevations are referenced to the height of a specific point (with corrections for the height of the geoid as a function of location) changes in sea level have no influence on the vertical datum. Now, the caveat would be that NOAA or the equivalent body for another country could decide in the future that they want to update their geodetic datum so that they choose a new zero point based on the new sea level height in some location, but there's not really a reason to do this. Vertical datums do get updated (though not incrementally, a vertical or horizontal datum is not changed once it's established, but a new one can be introduced, an example as described on several of those pages is the switch from the tidal datum of 1929 to the geodetic datum of 1988) but this is driven by better and more precise measurements of the gravitational field of the Earth and not changes in sea level, and in fact the US vertical datum [is set to be replaced in 2022](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/newdatums/index.shtml).", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 12151, "stickied": false, "score": 1468, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 19:04:47 2017", "ups": 1468}, {"body": "What about from a barometric pressure point of view?

When humans already evolved to be predators they can use those skills to both get food and control territories by driving out other predators.

When humans already evolved to be predators they can use those skills to both get food and control territories by driving out other predators.  As herbivores energy spent on predatory abilities needed to fight off other predators instead of defensive or fleeing ability would be less efficient as they wouldn't assist in gathering food as an herbivore and wasted energy is evolutionarily harmful.

That's maybe 100 times as much as a Saturn-V rocket. Is this a big deal? Yes.Let's have a quick look at the rocket equation. The Saturn-V rocket had a payload of 140,000 kg and weighed 2,970,000 kg, most of that being fuel, and lets give it a very generous exhaust velocity of 5km/s, which is a little over double that of the big engines and maybe just a little more than that of the small engines. Assuming infinitely efficient staging, we can plug that into the rocket equation and figure out that if you put a fully-fueled and somewhat idealized Saturn-V rocket in space and turned it on, it would [accelerate to 15 km/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rocket+equation&rawformassumption=%7B\"FS\"%7D+->+%7B%7B\"RocketEquation\",+\"vf\"%7D%7D&rawformassumption=%7B\"F\",+\"RocketEquation\",+\"vi\"%7D+->\"0+km%2Fs\"&rawformassumption=%7B\"F\",+\"RocketEquation\",+\"ve\"%7D+->\"5+km%2Fs\"&rawformassumption=%7B\"F\",+\"RocketEquation\",+\"mi\"%7D+->\"2.97e6+kg\"&rawformassumption=%7B\"F\",+\"RocketEquation\",+\"mf\"%7D+->\"140000kg\").If we took twice as much fuel (increasing our initial weight to 5,800,000 kg) the final speed would be 18.6 km/s. Well that's a tiny change, what's going on? Well, it turns out that for every bit of fuel that we want to take with us, we have to take even more fuel so that we can accelerate that first extra fuel. And then more for THAT extra fuel, etc. This is called the [tyranny of rockets](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html). A Saturn-V can accelerate 140 tons of payload to 18.6 km/s with 5600 tons of fuel.

Well, plugging bigger and bigger numbers into the initial rocket weight (all fuel!) you eventually get to the nonsense value of 1e130kg to get enough delta-v, which is amusingly many times more than the mass of the observable universe, so it doesn't really matter what size engine/fuel tank you bolt on a Saturn-V tech rocket, it won't be able to make the 1g Mars trip.But let's say we can use more effective engines, that means engines that can shoot the propellant out at much faster speeds.

I keep wondering what the new low will be, but attacking Puerto Rico\u2019s leadership while people are dying so he can protect his own ego seems to be it. Edit: I think it\u2019s also worth pointing out as I go back and re-read his tweets that he does something else sinister as well. He says the people of Puerto Rico want everything done for them. He\u2019s playing up the \u201cBrown people are dependent and want handouts\u201d narrative at a time while they have no food or water.

There are tons of items in ports and whatnot but no way to distribute.Problem #1: A LOT OF THE SUPPLIES IN CONTAINERS. **THESE ARE PRIVATE SECTOR GOODS.** YOU CAN'T JUST USE THEM WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPANIES. THIS TAKES TIME. The containers are not listed. You have to fine a manifest. But where's the manifest?Problem #2: Logistics. Getting actually equipment, manpower, and assets to Puerto Rick *takes fucking time*. I know that's not popular but it does.Problem #3: Moving the aid. You have to clear roads. Power lines. Debris. You have to have the truck drivers. Only 20% of the truckers in Puerto Rico have even returned. They can't find enough people capable of driving rigs to do the work. You have to have trained people for this.  Without that you can't move the goods to the stores.Problem #4: How can we distribute aid if we can't access the majority of Puerto Rico?

Cash is often more useful than supplies in an emergency, because it allows responders to allocate resources for the response more effectively.Here are some charities that you can donate to^\u2020. Please note that this list isn't exhaustive, and if you have the time it's always good to research the organizations you donate to.* [International Medical Corp](https://give.internationalmedicalcorps.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1983&ea.campaign.id=77513) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8158&fromlistid=272))* [Catholic Relief Services](https://support.crs.org/donate/hurricane-irma-relief) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=5934&fromlistid=272))* [Americares](https://secure.americares.org/site/Donation2?df_id=22510&mfc_pref=T&22510.donation=form1) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3289&fromlistid=272))* [Direct Relief](https://secure.directrelief.org/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app261b?df_id=2105&mfc_pref=T&2105.donation=form1&NONCE_TOKEN=A7AD6A19DBF10E2E23CBA6DB75F49855) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3626&fromlistid=272))* [Global Giving](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/hurricane-maria-caribbean-relief-fund/) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=11648&fromlistid=272))**Monthly Donations**If you've already made a donation, that's awesome!. As much as your budget allows, consider a monthly donation. Many disaster responses will see a glut of donations in the immediate aftermath, with donations petering out during the long recovery process.The response in Puerto Rico will be a long process, with funds needed to sustain the recovery. Consider setting up a small monthly donation with 1 or 2 charities of your choice. It really can be a small donation! Do what's right for your budget, but the predictability of these funds is itself is an enormous help; $5 a month will go a long way.These donations will be *immensely helpful* five months down the line when most of us aren't actively thinking about Puerto Rico.**Volunteering**Manpower is in high demand right now, **BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GO BY YOURSELF TO PEURTO RICO**. Only travel to Puerto Rico to volunteer if you're coordinating with an existing response group. Uncoordinated volunteers can very easily turn into an extra burden on response staff, so please only go if you're working with a response group.If you would like to volunteer, consider signing up on [VOAD's Puerto Rico Page](https://voad.communityos.org/volunteer-registration-pr-irma). VOAD will collect your information (skills, response availability, etc), distribute it to the various response organizations, and if one of those organizations wants you, VOAD will help you get in touch.In immediate high demand are truck driver's with a CDL and experience driving. If you fit the bill and could find the time to volunteer in Puerto Rico, please consider signing up.**Sources*** [(PBS) How you can help hurricane victims in Puerto Rico](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/can-help-hurricane-victims-puerto-rico/)* [(Charity Navigator) Hurricane Maria](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5356)* [(ABC) Helping Puerto Rico: Here's where and when to donate](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/helping-puerto-rico-donate-50179990)^\u2020 Charities selected for inclusion were those listed in this [PBS article](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/can-help-hurricane-victims-puerto-rico/) that also have a 4 star rating on [Charity Navigator's Hurricane Maria page](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5356).

As much as your budget allows, consider a monthly donation. Many disaster responses will see a glut of donations in the immediate aftermath, with donations petering out during the long recovery process.The response in Puerto Rico will be a long process, with funds needed to sustain the recovery. Consider setting up a small monthly donation with 1 or 2 charities of your choice. It really can be a small donation! Do what's right for your budget, but the predictability of these funds is itself is an enormous help; $5 a month will go a long way.These donations will be *immensely helpful* five months down the line when most of us aren't actively thinking about Puerto Rico.**Volunteering**Manpower is in high demand right now, **BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GO BY YOURSELF TO PEURTO RICO**. Only travel to Puerto Rico to volunteer if you're coordinating with an existing response group. Uncoordinated volunteers can very easily turn into an extra burden on response staff, so please only go if you're working with a response group.If you would like to volunteer, consider signing up on [VOAD's Puerto Rico Page](https://voad.communityos.org/volunteer-registration-pr-irma). VOAD will collect your information (skills, response availability, etc), distribute it to the various response organizations, and if one of those organizations wants you, VOAD will help you get in touch.In immediate high demand are truck driver's with a CDL and experience driving.

He dismissed her discomfort saying  \"it's ok im 100% gay\" and attempted to continue the process without re-obtaining her approval.  She took it as inappropriate conduct and complained.  He was then fired. If you listen to the actual case audibles this case is really about was he fired for acting a way a gay person is allowed to or not allowed to act.  Is it a fireable offense to force her back into that situation just because he's gay and claims He wouldn't make a move? If he was straight he also would have been fired instantly.

These claims also assume that Trump\u2019s actions are calculated and deliberate \u2014 that he\u2019s a\u00a0clever media manipulator, always staying one step ahead of editors in Washington and New York.>The **second theory** is that the response was **impulsive and primarily emotional**.\u00a0Trump\u00a0initially began criticizing the NFL and NFL players\u00a0at a rally last Friday in Huntsville, Alabama, including referring (although not by name) to former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick as a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d for protesting during the national anthem. Perhaps encouraged by the raucous response he received from the crowd, Trump went on a\u00a0tweetstorm\u00a0about the NFL, its owners and its players that lasted intermittently over the next several days.\u00a0...>Not all of this \u2014 particularly not roping the\u00a0popular\u00a0Curry into the controversy \u2014 necessarily seemed all that \u201ccalculated\u201d to me. Instead, it seemed to fit a different behavioral pattern: Trump is piqued by criticism and rarely backs down, especially when he\u2019s challenged by women or minorities \u2014 such as Curry, the\u00a0predominantly black NFL player pool,\u00a0ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill,\u00a0Khizr and Ghazala Khan,\u00a0Judge Gonzalo B. Curiel,\u00a0London Mayor Sadiq Khan,\u00a0former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly\u00a0or\u00a0Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, to take some of many examples.>...>[T]he theories are in conflict because they\u2019re about the\u00a0intent and motivation for Trump\u2019s behavior\u00a0and not necessarily its effects. **The first theory says that Trump is calculating and rational; the second says that he\u2019s impulsive and emotional. The first theory implies that Trump may be employing \u201cracially charged\u201d rhetoric and actions for political gain. The second implies that Trump himself may harbor degrees of racial resentment, and resentment toward women, and that it colors his response to news events. Either way, Trump\u2019s actions could be politically effective or ineffective.** (Trump\u2019s approval rating\u00a0declined slightly this week\u00a0after his NFL comments, although it\u2019s hard to know if they\u2019re the reason why.) However, it seems important to know what motivates them. **If Trump\u2019s actions are driven by emotional outbursts more than\u00a0calculated trollishness, that might predict a different response to how he deals with escalating tensions with North Korea, for example.**>...>It\u2019s much harder to describe some of Trump\u2019s ... outbursts \u2014 like those against the Khan family or Judge Curiel, for example \u2014 as representing a calculated political strategy. The same goes for Trump\u2019s tweetstorm on Saturday morning about San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who had\u00a0criticized the White House\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria.>**No matter how cynical one is, it\u2019s hard to see what possible political benefit Trump could get from criticizing Cruz, whose\u00a0city was devastated by Maria and remains largely without power and otherwise in crisis. Nor is the government\u2019s response to Maria necessarily something that Trump wants to draw a lot of attention to.** I\u2019ve seen debates\u00a0back\u00a0and\u00a0forth\u00a0in the media over the past week about whether Trump\u2019s response to Maria is analogous to the one former President George W. Bush had to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Trump\u2019s dismissiveness toward Cruz almost certainly won\u2019t help his side of the argument; instead, it will amplify growing criticism about\u00a0how the government handled Puerto Rico\u00a0and why Trump seemed to be more interested in the NFL protests than in his administration\u2019s hurricane recovery plan.>**I\u2019m happy to acknowledge that Trump\u2019s responses to the news are\u00a0sometimes\u00a0thought-out and deliberate.** **His\u00a0criticisms of the media often seem to fall into this category**, for example, since they\u2019re sure to get widespread coverage and Republican voters have\u00a0overwhelmingly lost faith in the media.>**But at many other times, journalists come up with overly convoluted explanations for Trump\u2019s behavior** (\u201cthis seemingly self-destructive emotional outburst is actually a clever political strategy!\u201d) **when simpler ones will suffice** (\u201cthis is a self-destructive emotional outburst.\u201d).

These claims also assume that Trump\u2019s actions are calculated and deliberate \u2014 that he\u2019s a\u00a0clever media manipulator, always staying one step ahead of editors in Washington and New York.>The **second theory** is that the response was **impulsive and primarily emotional**.\u00a0Trump\u00a0initially began criticizing the NFL and NFL players\u00a0at a rally last Friday in Huntsville, Alabama, including referring (although not by name) to former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick as a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d for protesting during the national anthem. Perhaps encouraged by the raucous response he received from the crowd, Trump went on a\u00a0tweetstorm\u00a0about the NFL, its owners and its players that lasted intermittently over the next several days.\u00a0...>Not all of this \u2014 particularly not roping the\u00a0popular\u00a0Curry into the controversy \u2014 necessarily seemed all that \u201ccalculated\u201d to me. Instead, it seemed to fit a different behavioral pattern: Trump is piqued by criticism and rarely backs down, especially when he\u2019s challenged by women or minorities \u2014 such as Curry, the\u00a0predominantly black NFL player pool,\u00a0ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill,\u00a0Khizr and Ghazala Khan,\u00a0Judge Gonzalo B. Curiel,\u00a0London Mayor Sadiq Khan,\u00a0former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly\u00a0or\u00a0Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, to take some of many examples.>...>[T]he theories are in conflict because they\u2019re about the\u00a0intent and motivation for Trump\u2019s behavior\u00a0and not necessarily its effects. **The first theory says that Trump is calculating and rational; the second says that he\u2019s impulsive and emotional. The first theory implies that Trump may be employing \u201cracially charged\u201d rhetoric and actions for political gain. The second implies that Trump himself may harbor degrees of racial resentment, and resentment toward women, and that it colors his response to news events. Either way, Trump\u2019s actions could be politically effective or ineffective.** (Trump\u2019s approval rating\u00a0declined slightly this week\u00a0after his NFL comments, although it\u2019s hard to know if they\u2019re the reason why.) However, it seems important to know what motivates them. **If Trump\u2019s actions are driven by emotional outbursts more than\u00a0calculated trollishness, that might predict a different response to how he deals with escalating tensions with North Korea, for example.**>...>It\u2019s much harder to describe some of Trump\u2019s ... outbursts \u2014 like those against the Khan family or Judge Curiel, for example \u2014 as representing a calculated political strategy. The same goes for Trump\u2019s tweetstorm on Saturday morning about San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who had\u00a0criticized the White House\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria.>**No matter how cynical one is, it\u2019s hard to see what possible political benefit Trump could get from criticizing Cruz, whose\u00a0city was devastated by Maria and remains largely without power and otherwise in crisis. Nor is the government\u2019s response to Maria necessarily something that Trump wants to draw a lot of attention to.** I\u2019ve seen debates\u00a0back\u00a0and\u00a0forth\u00a0in the media over the past week about whether Trump\u2019s response to Maria is analogous to the one former President George W. Bush had to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Trump\u2019s dismissiveness toward Cruz almost certainly won\u2019t help his side of the argument; instead, it will amplify growing criticism about\u00a0how the government handled Puerto Rico\u00a0and why Trump seemed to be more interested in the NFL protests than in his administration\u2019s hurricane recovery plan.>**I\u2019m happy to acknowledge that Trump\u2019s responses to the news are\u00a0sometimes\u00a0thought-out and deliberate.** **His\u00a0criticisms of the media often seem to fall into this category**, for example, since they\u2019re sure to get widespread coverage and Republican voters have\u00a0overwhelmingly lost faith in the media.>**But at many other times, journalists come up with overly convoluted explanations for Trump\u2019s behavior** (\u201cthis seemingly self-destructive emotional outburst is actually a clever political strategy!\u201d) **when simpler ones will suffice** (\u201cthis is a self-destructive emotional outburst.\u201d).

Cash is often more useful than supplies in an emergency, because it allows responders to allocate resources for the response more effectively.Here are some charities that you can donate to^\u2020. Please note that this list isn't exhaustive, and if you have the time it's always good to research the organizations you donate to.* [International Medical Corp](https://give.internationalmedicalcorps.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1983&ea.campaign.id=77513) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8158&fromlistid=272))* [Catholic Relief Services](https://support.crs.org/donate/hurricane-irma-relief) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=5934&fromlistid=272))* [Americares](https://secure.americares.org/site/Donation2?df_id=22510&mfc_pref=T&22510.donation=form1) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3289&fromlistid=272))* [Direct Relief](https://secure.directrelief.org/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app261b?df_id=2105&mfc_pref=T&2105.donation=form1&NONCE_TOKEN=A7AD6A19DBF10E2E23CBA6DB75F49855) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3626&fromlistid=272))* [Global Giving](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/hurricane-maria-caribbean-relief-fund/) ([CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=11648&fromlistid=272))**Monthly Donations**If you've already made a donation, that's awesome!. As much as your budget allows, consider a monthly donation. Many disaster responses will see a glut of donations in the immediate aftermath, with donations petering out during the long recovery process.The response in Puerto Rico will be a long process, with funds needed to sustain the recovery. Consider setting up a small monthly donation with 1 or 2 charities of your choice. It really can be a small donation! Do what's right for your budget, but the predictability of these funds is itself is an enormous help; $5 a month will go a long way.These donations will be *immensely helpful* five months down the line when most of us aren't actively thinking about Puerto Rico.**Volunteering**Manpower is in high demand right now, **BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GO BY YOURSELF TO PEURTO RICO**. Only travel to Puerto Rico to volunteer if you're coordinating with an existing response group. Uncoordinated volunteers can very easily turn into an extra burden on response staff, so please only go if you're working with a response group.If you would like to volunteer, consider signing up on [VOAD's Puerto Rico Page](https://voad.communityos.org/volunteer-registration-pr-irma). VOAD will collect your information (skills, response availability, etc), distribute it to the various response organizations, and if one of those organizations wants you, VOAD will help you get in touch.In immediate high demand are truck driver's with a CDL and experience driving. If you fit the bill and could find the time to volunteer in Puerto Rico, please consider signing up.**Sources*** [(PBS) How you can help hurricane victims in Puerto Rico](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/can-help-hurricane-victims-puerto-rico/)* [(Charity Navigator) Hurricane Maria](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5356)* [(ABC) Helping Puerto Rico: Here's where and when to donate](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/helping-puerto-rico-donate-50179990)^\u2020 Charities selected for inclusion were those listed in this [PBS article](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/can-help-hurricane-victims-puerto-rico/) that also have a 4 star rating on [Charity Navigator's Hurricane Maria page](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5356).

I guess the difference between how the Kremlin treats the left vs how they treat the right is interesting. With the right, they make conspiracy theories and fake news and promote racism through fake events and fake individuals. With the left they... make up fake quotes that still have good points and otherwise make accurate arguments dealing with the problematic state of the relationship between police and minorities in the USA?

His goal was to make me think of the FCC as an established institution that was doing its job and should not be questioned. He then argued essentially that ISPs built the infrastructure for the internet and should be entitled to manage it. He then established that Pai would make the decision so as to minimize his culpability. Finally he tried to divert me to a completely different issue by saying I should really be focused on his initiative to increase rural broadband access. Which of course will be granted through the (heavily subsidized) work of the ISPs.Based on his argument, either he is dumb or he assumes I am dumb. Hopefully the latter, but intelligence has never been a pre-requisite for public office. Inevitably it is in his best interest to serve ISPs. This highlights the problem with writing congress.

There is some statistic out there that Netflix uses 80% of bandwidth on Friday nights, a neutral internet is providing a huge subsidy to them. Also people who use less data/bandwidth (i.e. our grandparents) are essentially subsidising our higher usage which is not really fair. Now I still think that removing net neutrality could lead to abuse, I think that most fair way to do it is to charge customers for data this should remove the subsidies because it also prevents providers from throttling some over others for profit reasons.Every Time this debate comes up on reddit it becomes a huge circle jerk and I did not even know there were quite valid arguments against it and a lot of misunderstanding. One example from the talk was a girl said she was concerned that companies would throttle articles of opposing political views or against the companies. This is just incredibly unrealistic, the only way they could do that it through blocking because text uses essentially no bandwidth and no conservative I have met and discussed the issue with is remotely in favor of blocking.I just want to end by saying it seems to me like this debate is always framed as verizon or other isps being rich greedy mofos. You guys realize that Netflix, google and others are not supporting net neutrality out of the kindness of their hearts right? It's because a less \"neutral\" internet would hurt their bottom line. They are not heros, they are doing the same thing as verizon they just have been able to put a much better spin on it through, arguably, tactics using information.

They then start with various accusations and excuses as to why feminism is bad and feminists are evil. Here is a conversation I've just had here on reddit:-person: I disagree with the feminist movement in almost every way. I see my self more as an egalitarian than a feminist-me: Then you don't understand what feminism is. It's the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities. If you're for equality between sexes you're a feminist.-person: They might believe that but it's not what they're trying to get. They don't advocate equality at all, just look at how they talk about rape for instance, they NEVER take into account male victims of rape. The majority of the movement advocates that females are the only victimsI advocate real equality be it race or sex/gender. I take offense to being labelled as a feminist for having that beliefWhy is it that they seem to want to hate feminism with such a *passion*? It feels to me like those particular individuals can't accept a movement that isn't all about them. That as soon as their gender isn't the center of attention they can't cope.

I am doing physical therapy for it and it\u2019s getting better!I[f29] have been experiencing severe vaginal pain during intercourse for three and a half years and I\u2019m excited because tomorrow, I\u2019m going to have sex with the confidence that I won\u2019t experience the unbearable pain I have been suffering with for so long. I want to tell my story in hopes it may help someone else and give them the confidence to get help.Let\u2019s start with the general info: my boyfriend and I have been together for 9 years. I have been on the same birth control (Nuvaring) for all 9 years. For the first 6 years of dating, I have had no issue with pain or discomfort during sex. I feel like the pain happened rather suddenly.So, just under 4 years ago I moved across the country to a new state. My boyfriend stayed behind while I decided if this new life is where I wanted to stay. After about 6 months, he joined me on this side of the U.S. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint when, but somewhere in that 6 months I began to experience severe pain during intercourse. At first it felt like burning, chafing, a crappy yeast infection, then quickly progressed into searing, stabbing, and incredibly sharp pain that would bring me to tears. I wrote way more about the whole journey to where the next paragraph has ended up but determined it too long for Reddit. Let me know if you want more of this 3 year journey.The beginning of June this year I saw a pelvic therapist for the first time. She has completely changed my world and I would recommend ANYONE with vaginal pain issues to at least give a therapist a try. Our first meeting she asks me a number of questions: What does the pain feel like? Does it affect bowel movements or urination? Did I ever fall on my tailbone or vulva as a kid? Describe where it hurts... and so on. She showed me an app on her ipad and talked about all the muscles in your pelvic region, and holy crap did I have one hell of an amazing anatomy lesson. There are soooo many muscles down there and they are all interconnected, intertwined and impressive. She then explains what one therapy session is like so I\u2019m comfortable with everything she is about to do before she even has me remove my pants. And yes, I\u2019ve gotta remove my pants.She starts to massage my exterior pelvic muscles everything from hamstrings, quads, inner thigh, lower abdomen, upper abdomen, lower back, and even stretching my feet. I\u2019ll admit it wasn\u2019t some relaxing massage at the spa\u2026 this was intense, painful, and sort of difficult. This doctor understands the position I\u2019m in and explains everything as she\u2019s working on it. Why it hurts, how she\u2019s working out the muscle tension, why when she grabs my inner thigh my butt hurts and so on. As part of the session, she shows me some interesting things about our musculature. She can press on an area that hurts, say one of my glute muscles, the pain is pretty rough but then with her other hand she grabs my inner thigh muscle and gently rotates it and suddenly all the pain is gone\u2026 She relieves the tension with several other pairs of muscles. It\u2019s unbelieveable. At the end of the session she gives me a list of stretches I should do and explains what our next steps will be. I walk out of the office feeling like I had the best damn deep tissue massage of a lifetime.She diagnosed me that day. Even though I\u2019d had so many other diagnosis, I knew this one was right, I could see the evidence already, the relief in my pelvis. I have a pelvic floor dysfunction. I start my stretches and put them into my nightly routine as I hit the sack. I think I did them at least 4 or 5 times a week. Two weeks later, I\u2019m back at therapy for my next session. We both can already feel a huge difference with just two weeks of stretching. She goes back to massaging my exterior muscles again amazing me with how interconnected my anatomy is. She points out that my lower abdomen right above my pelvic bone appears to cave inward. This is a huge indication that the muscles are way too tight. She shows me some methods of stretching the muscle that\u2019s stuck between the two hip bones then puts gloves and lube on. She proceeds to work on massaging inside the vagina. This is in no way sexual, and she\u2019s very good about making sure I am comfortable the entire time. She talks about the interior canal and how the muscles are all connected. She would press against one wall and I could feel it in my glutes or hip flexors it was all very strange. Unfortunately it was a similar experience to the massage on the exterior. She\u2019s basically relaxing muscles that haven\u2019t been relaxed in 3 years. It hurts, just like any muscle would after a hard day at the gym. I\u2019m incredibly sore, but I already understand the outcome of this therapy session. I once again walk out feeling like I had THE BEST deep massage of a lifetime.After some real progress with my stretching and her massages, she gives me an acrylic wand and teaches me how to use it to start stretching my insides. It\u2019s definitely weird and I feel like I\u2019m seducing myself everytime I use it, but I\u2019m not masturbating, I\u2019m using the wand to find the problem pressure points and using it to relieve the pain. I\u2019ve also noticed that that space between my hip bones is no longer caving inward. In fact, it is much flatter has made my whole belly look much flatter. I\u2019ve been at this long enough I can tell what my problem areas are and not just everything hurts all the time. I\u2019ve been working with my therapist on specific regions lately and have seen huge improvements.Plus, sex is good again. It\u2019s not completely pain free yet, and probably won\u2019t be for a little while, but it\u2019s good. Like, really good. The pain is so minimal, after a few seconds of doin\u2019 it the pain fades away. In fact, I\u2019m horny again. For the first times in years, I WANT sex, I crave it and my nethers yearn for it. It\u2019s awesome.I\u2019ve been in therapy since June and have been to about 7 sessions. I still have so much more to go, but I am so happy that my vaginal pain is getting better. It\u2019s slowly going away, and I can now recognize issues, or pinpoint muscles that are causing the problem and tensions, and I know how to fix that. I can relax my issue muscles. I can enjoy sex again.This is my experience and my journey, but if I have any recommendations for you, seek out a pelvic therapist. Don\u2019t give up, the pain is not \u201call in your head\u201d. Sure you should relax those muscles, but someone has to teach you how to do it. There are so many women out there with their own stories, journeys, so know that you are not alone and it CAN get better.For anyone with a significant other experiencing vaginal pain, the best you can do is be there to support them. Understand that they might not want to have sex, and suggest alternatives that don\u2019t involve penetration. My boyfriend was here every step of the way and is a huge help in supporting me, making me feel comfortable and making sure I am happy.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "73dft6", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Vaginal Pain - My Pelvic Dysfunction Therapy Story", "num_comments": 5, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 20, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 429, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/73dft6/vaginal_pain_my_pelvic_dysfunction_therapy_story/", "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 10:24:09 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "congratulations, that's great news for you and your bf", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 231, "stickied": false, "score": 4, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 16:35:12 2017", "ups": 4}, {"body": "Super interesting.

Just accept it as part of a process. It might be frustrating, but you are going to have way better orgasms when you are done, I promise. So here's your steps:1. Stop using porn. Just consider that it isn't an option, for either of you. 2. Start doing other sexy stuff with no expectation of sex or an orgasm. Read erotica in a hot bath (try some fanfic, there's no shame in that game). Try just a long makeout and oral session - again *no* expectation of orgasm. A good thing is a sexy massage. As in, an all-over massage just for turning you on, it can include oral or a bit of digital stimulation if you're into it. Talk about your fantasies, focus on doing the stuff you really like. 3. Only once you are good and turned on, do you start having sex again. This can be two weeks later, it can be a month later, just whenever the sexual tension is running very high. When you have sex, focus on what feels good. Focus *intensely* on what feels good and do more of it. A lot of women will shortcut to a vibrator here because they feel too demanding for enough foreplay and the kind of sex they like. Remember that you don't have to do that. Or, if using the vibe isn't the issue, but the porn is, add it in for funsies if you want. 4. Remember that it's okay to not have an orgasm every time. Yes, it can be frustrating, but you *can* create that sensation without the porn. A lot of women use the porn as a distraction to focus on something hot without thinking about themselves. You don't have to do that. Side topic: a lot of women only orgasm with direct clitoral stimulation *and* penetration. You can do both with the right positions!

Just accept it as part of a process. It might be frustrating, but you are going to have way better orgasms when you are done, I promise. So here's your steps:1. Stop using porn. Just consider that it isn't an option, for either of you. 2. Start doing other sexy stuff with no expectation of sex or an orgasm. Read erotica in a hot bath (try some fanfic, there's no shame in that game). Try just a long makeout and oral session - again *no* expectation of orgasm. A good thing is a sexy massage. As in, an all-over massage just for turning you on, it can include oral or a bit of digital stimulation if you're into it. Talk about your fantasies, focus on doing the stuff you really like. 3. Only once you are good and turned on, do you start having sex again. This can be two weeks later, it can be a month later, just whenever the sexual tension is running very high. When you have sex, focus on what feels good. Focus *intensely* on what feels good and do more of it. A lot of women will shortcut to a vibrator here because they feel too demanding for enough foreplay and the kind of sex they like. Remember that you don't have to do that. Or, if using the vibe isn't the issue, but the porn is, add it in for funsies if you want. 4. Remember that it's okay to not have an orgasm every time. Yes, it can be frustrating, but you *can* create that sensation without the porn. A lot of women use the porn as a distraction to focus on something hot without thinking about themselves. You don't have to do that. Side topic: a lot of women only orgasm with direct clitoral stimulation *and* penetration. You can do both with the right positions!

She's much older than me, and I still have yet to finish college and move out from the parent's house, so it's hard for me to consider things from that kind of perspective.So to start off, she's 35, I'm 21. I don't want to explain everything, but essentially we met while walking our dogs, continued to walk our dogs together every night for almost a week before we started ending the walk at her place & fooling around. After the third time, I realized there was a picture in her living room of her getting married. She didn't wear a wedding ring, so I assumed they were divorced, but I got suspicious and kept my eyes open. Noticed men's shoes and clothes in the closet and a few male products in the bathroom (shampoo, body wash, etc).So last night there were a pair of men's jeans next to her bed, and decided it was the perfect time to ask. She instantly broke down crying talking about how her husband doesn't pay attention to her anymore and barely even acknowledges her existence, especially when he's playing video games (his addiction). He shot down the idea of a marriage counselor but refuses to try and fix anything, and she's dependent on him so she can't really leave him unless she wants to try to live on a $11/hr wage. I assumed this was the end of things, and told her we can still go on walks and just talk if she'd like, but she doesn't want it to end. In all honesty, I don't want it to either, I've experienced a huge boost in self confidence and happiness since it all started (obviously) and I really enjoyed her company even before we slept together. If she's stuck in a relationship where her SO won't even look away from a computer screen to talk to her, let alone watch TV with her, take her on a date, or try and fix their issues, am I really doing something so wrong? I don't want to be a homewrecker, although I might already be, but if anyone has advice as to what to do in this situation or has experienced something similar before, I'd love to hear it.EDIT: To clarify, she's told me she doesn't want anything more than company and sex, and I feel the same way.

For the past 6 months or so I've been really, really discontent. I always used to look forward to changes, seeing them as new adventures, and inevitably took the opinion of if things don't work out, you can always change your situation. I was married before and bought a house, and both times it was exciting. But I always knew that if things didn't work out, I'd land on my feet.I met my second husband and we've been house hunting, and I'm just....not excited. This time, with my age, buying the house seems more permanent. It feels like we have to make a longer range decision because the house has to be in a good school system as we're planning to have a kid, and then we won't be able to move really once the kid comes. Plus, I feel more stuck with my husband. Up until this point I've always known I can find a new guy if I want to, but recently, I've noticed I'm looking older. In the past year I've gotten wrinkles and grey hair, and while I don't look like an old bag, I'm realizing I do look my age now. I didn't before. That plus I'm getting some random health problems, and I'm just feeling like the horizon is closing in on me. Buying a house with my husband just seems like too final, but I really do want to buy one- it's the best thing for us to do logically, and up until recently I really wanted to. Also it's not like I could go find a new guy at my age like I used to- I hate the idea of dating someone older than me, but I feel like I don't have the stamina to keep up with a younger guy. Plus I really do love my husband, it's not a fake relationship.I've talked to a couple of people about this and they're sure it's his fault- that I'm getting cold feet about him or something. And maybe that's true, we are in an old married couple routine but generally I like that. I'm too old to go to the clubs and to parties now (although I was doing that up until last year, I am suddenly feeling out of place so although I would love to keep going, I feel awkward). Plus my friends who I did that with all had babies so that's out. Am I just in a rut with my husband? Are my cold feet a sign of something I shouldn't be ignoring about the relationship? People seem to think so since I was so gung ho about buying a house with the first husband, but I'm not so sure.I also got a new job a year ago that allows me to support myself in an upper middle class lifestyle all by myself, and while that's been great overall, part of me thinks the brakes have been taken off in a sense. I mean that as in, I could now be alone or dating and not have to worry about money, which has never been the case before. When I was single before I was able to rent a 1 bed, pay my bills, etc, but I couldn't reach my financial goals.

I've had a very long week and am just looking for \"outside\" opinions on my situation. I'm sorry for the long read but in order to understand my situation, I want you to know all the facts before possibly giving me some advice. Thank you for even taking time out of your day to read a teenage girl's problems. I know it probably seems pretty dumb to many, my petty little problems, but right now I'm heart broken and just feeling pretty lost so any advice at all would be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance \ud83d\udc9c.   To begin with, you should probably know I'm a 19 year old female. That of course means drama, that I normally try my best to keep to a minimum. As of last night however, I broke up with my boyfriend. The thing is I'm absolutely MADLY in love with this man. He's the first guy in my life (relationship wise) to ever treat me right and also the first real \"serious\" relationship I've ever had. He's given me flowers, remembers any sort of \"little thing\" about me and will bring me food on the worse days of my life. He lets me call him at 3 in the morning because I'm so stressed and just listens to what I have to say and ALWAYS calms me down. He's patient with and just hugs me if I'm having a bad day. He helps me study and remain focused in school and also really just helps me have fun and kind of \"cut loose\" on the weekends. Most of all though, he's there for me and truly loves me. Something I truly, cannot thank him enough for. To you all, this may not seem like a lot but he's more than I could of ever thought possible. See the thing is, I'm not very religious, but because I never got to go to Prom (no guy ever asked me and all my friends had dates they were already going with), I would pray every night just for a man to eventually care about me. Of course this got added on later after some heartbreak, but after countless days of crying in my car and eating alone because all my friends were on their \"date night\", and I had no one else to eat with and didn't want to sit in a restaurant alone, I also prayed for a guy just to listen to what I have to say and eat food with me from time-to-time. This way, I could also have a \"date night\" and have a day of the week to look forward to instead of crying alone to Adele while eating some Chipotle (you can judge me, but I was in a rough place in life). So this man means absolutely everything to me. I tell him all the time how very fortunate I am to have a guy like him. Most women are married to guys who don't even pay attention to them, but I found a guy who looks at me, smiles and tells me how \"pretty\" I am. He loves making me blush with those little comments and he also loves making me happy. He would do anything to make me laugh and I'd do anything to make him laugh and smile as well. I try to be there best I can, comfort Gina me always talk to him and offer advice if he needs any. But really, he's the fantastic one, inside and outside of the bedroom as well as an all around, fantastic guy inside and out. He's also, literally, the guy who answered my prayers and showed me what it's like to be loved.However, that's what makes my situation now seem impossible and why I feel so heartbroken. I know at this point, you're probably confused as to why I broke up with him. Well the actual problem is with ME. I'm currently trying to get my degree and become a Commercial Pilot. Let's just say the past year-and-a-half of college has not exactly gone \"according to plan\". I wouldn't say I'm that dull, but when it comes to Aviation it's been an uphill battle for me. I knew it would be since I went in to this major pretty blind (meaning I don't have family in aviation or many connections so all the information is brand new, whereas, most my peers have had 18+ years of being exposed to aviation through their family and such). However, I never imagined it would be this difficult. Now that I'm a Sophomore, my GPA is struggling to remain adequate enough for the aviation requirements. I'm retaking some classes that will replace my failed grades from before and I have honestly never studied harder or taken school more seriously than I do right now. However, I have been reconsidering what I'm really and truly capable of. After much discussion with my parents, I've decided that if this semester doesn't work out, I will be moving back home with them (a state away) and going for a different degree at a college near them. It's not really what I want to do at all since becoming a pilot has been my dream, and I'm still fighting hard for it, it just feels like it's not going to happen especially after yesterday. So, Friday I had two exams in one day and a speech to give. I made a 100% on my speech,  my exam in Chemistry I think I did pretty well on (80%+), but when it came to one of my aviation classes I just bombed the heck out of it. This particular aviation class consists of only four grades. Three of those four grades are 3 different tests, and the last grade consists of our final exam (another test, but this one carries more weight on our overall grade). I realized that while I don't have my test grade back yet, I still know I failed my first exam in that class. I know this because halfway through I was tilting my head like a puppy and going,\"I have never seen this material in my life. This is simply a disaster.\" Needless to say, I had to fill in most the short answers with some BS I know isn't right, but was my best guess with the information that I was given and what I know from previous classes/experience.  So I talk to my boyfriend immediately following the class. It was the last class of the day and I was really looking forward to seeing him last night because he always makes me very happy. However, while on the phone I finally realize that this is going to be a class I hardly pull off even if I make 100's on my next three exams. He knows what's at stake and just told me to calm down, but I also realize that because I just failed that test I will be getting the boot out of the Aviation program I'm desperately clinging to stay in. This means in December, I will have to leave the state and return home to my parents. This, not becoming a pilot and Pershing my dreams :/ I start crying because you know, I'm human and have a breaking point. Also, no one likes feeling, let alone, actually being, a failure. It just feels like even after days of studying I can't pull off the grades I need to in my own degree and also it's just been a long day. At this point, I'm exhausted and my boyfriend is explaining how \"everything is going to be okay and just work out\". How I wish I could believe him, he's just so f***ing great. But I also realize, I'm the one holding him back in the relationship. Between crying, stressing myself out and causing him unnecessary stress over this degree, having to move away in December, I'm like the parasite he doesn't need in his life. I need him, but he simply doesn't need me. I'm also basically stringing-him-along because if I leave in December he's not exactly coming with me. Why would I force him to stay with a failure like me who will be living about 250 miles away? I decided to tell him all of this, at which point he of course insisted that I made him \"happy\" and \"completed him\" just like I feel he completes me and that we could \"make things work even if it's long-distance\". Why would I make such a great guy stick with me, a failure he won't be able to see after December? So I broke things off. As soon as I hung up the phone, I balled my eyes out for about 4 hours until I fell asleep for pure exhaustion and heartbreak. He of course has texted me all last night and today, about how much he \"loves me\" and doesn't want me to \"go\". I don't want to \"go\" either, but for the next few months, I don't want to get closer to him in fear of hurting him even more when I probably have to leave and never return to this state, after December. So dear Redditor I hope you can see my dilemma and I appreciate you hearing me out and probably, my dumb life story. Again, I apologize for the long read but I just need someone, anyone, to understand and offer some words of advice while feeling very lost and of course, heartbroken like most teenage girls. So I leave the following question in your hopefully, very capable hands...Should I be selfish, and try to get back with him or should I just keep fighting for my grades best I can alone? Alternatively, should I just do both? Fight for my grades while apologizing to him and hoping he'll take me back while working best I can, for my grades to get me past December? If there's any other route or suggestion you think I should take please let me know in the comments below.

He gets to decide if you're just baggage dragging him down, not you.  Sometimes having happiness with your soulmate  is more important than \"going places\".   I recommend letting him love you, love him the way you want, and remember this time for when he needs some extra support and understanding from you.  As for school and aviation stuff - it is a tough road.  You've chosen a challenge, for sure.  Good job, and I say keep persuing it.  Persistence is everything.  I had to retake classes, re-fly checkrides, study-study-study, miss holidays and family events, and I barely made it through flight school, but now I've been a pilot for 10 years.  Lastly, there are many many roads into aviation careers, not all in the \"program\".  If school+aviation+whatever else is too much right now, it doesn't mean you're not ever going to get there.  It doesn't mean you're too stupid to fly!  It just means, heck, chemistry is hard, flying is hard, and you're doing it all at once.  Talk to your instructors, talk to your teachers, talk to your academic advisors.  They may be able to help with your program, let you retake a class or two.  If absolutely nothing works and you still go home without completing, remember there are other ways to be a pilot.  Finish school first, then reapply to an aviation program.  Or, if you're not opposed to service, the military has some great opportunities, check out the US Army's programs for warrant officer pilots.  Seriously, you're super young (not an insult, everyone is 19) and the whole world is ahead - very few failures in life are permanent, and there are many paths to take to get to where you want.

Meanwhile, the anti-independence parties (C with 17,9%, PSC with 12,72% and PP (which btw is the governing party in Spain) with 8,49%) have 39,11% of the vote.

JxSi has 62, C has 25, PSC has 16, CSQP has 11, PP has 11 and CUP has 10. That makes:* Pro independence parties have 72 Seats* Pro referendum parties have 83 Seats* Anti referendum (and anti independence) parties have 52 Seats(Total of seats is 135)One thing has to be noted here, both JxSi and CUP made it very explicit that if they got over 50% of the vote together they would have unliaterally declared independence. As they \"only\" got 47%, they decided on making a referendum to let the people decide as there was a clear majority (56%, according to recent polls 82% granted that it's a legal one) in favor of doing the referendum, and that's how 2 years later we are here.Source: https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleccions_al_Parlament_de_Catalunya_de_2015BTW, this is how the catalan map looks like if we look at what party has the majority vote in each area; JxSi is green, C is orange, PSC is red and CUP is yellow. PP didn't win anywhere.https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitxer:Election_Map_Catalonia_2015.svg[Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Posicionament_dels_municipis_catalans_respecte_el_refer%C3%A8ndum_de_l%27u_d%27octubre.svg) we have another map, where you can see which regions will actively support the referendum (dark green), support the referendum in other ways (light green), are against opening polling booths (red) and haven't said anything about it (light gray).Another BTW, let's talk about what the numbers are for the mayors of Catalonia. Recently, 712 (of 947) mayors signed a declaration saying they will provide the voting spaces for the referendum and are now being investigated for it. That's 75% of catalan mayors. The distribution of mayors in Catalonia looks like this:* CiU 437 mayors, 46,1% (CIU is part of JxSi and is now called PDeCat)* PSC-CP 122 mayors, 12,9%* ERC-AM 259 mayors, 27,3 (ERC is part of JxSi)  * ICV-EUiA-Entesa 21 mayors, 2,2%  * CUP-PA 19 mayors, 2%  * PP 1 mayor, 0.1%  * C's 0 mayors  * Other parties and independents, 88 mayors, 9.3%Notice how 2 of the 3 anti-referendum, anti-independece parties have 1 and 0 mayors respectively.Source: http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/catala/dades/telec/loc/loc15/cloc1108.htm", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 16148, "stickied": false, "score": 117, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 12:41:36 2017", "ups": 117}, {"body": "Why is nobody pointing out that this poll was conducted by \"The National: A Newspaper That Supports An Independent Scotland\"??A rabid pro-scottish-independence nationalist newspaper... a little biased, don't you think.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 68565, "stickied": false, "score": 80, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 17:15:06 2017", "ups": 80}, {"body": ">A SENSATIONAL new poll which **The National** is publishing on the eve of the Catalan independence referendum shows an upsurge in support for independenceHmmmm...>The National: The newspaper that supports an independent ScotlandWhat an interesting and unbiased source...", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 71, "stickied": false, "score": 72, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 17:15:51 2017", "ups": 72}, {"body": "Serious question.

The government is largely corrupt and has let the roads, airports, ports, etc. either fall behind largely in readiness or they did not manage them properly. The federal aid money sent to PR (in months and years prior) has not been used to maintain their infrastructure appropriately.This is exacerbated by the fact that, by pointing at Trump (whether right or wrong), it caused Trump to inadvertently then bring to light the massive mismanagement (which isn't secret to anyone living there or from there, but is unknown to most Americans - nearly 50% don't even know PR is part of the US). So, this is turning into a smoke and mirrors show of \"blame Trump so we can hide our mismanagement and abuse of federal aid and overall ineptitude\" vs Trump's childish inability to let an insult go.There's many things to fault Trump for, but this is political corruption exposed after years of neglect. They (PR) were given money explicitly to prevent this sort of scenario, but a majority of it has not been used for that purpose, instead going to the pockets of local politicians.Any other money, aside from the aid already sent to PR, has to come from a specific fund or from Congress. Any movement in this direction would require a look into existing federal funds sent, their usage, etc. PR politicians don't want this, which is why they're not requesting more money or aid, but instead firing back at the administration and trying to paint this as federal ineptitude, in an effort to take themselves out of the focus.Once again, I'm not on either side here, but PR has a huge corruption problem, and has for decades. The politicians have failed and now they're being exposed for it. It would behoove both sides to review the use of federal aid money and let charges fall on the appropriate people; clean out the PR government and let real change happen.
