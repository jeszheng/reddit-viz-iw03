However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.Finally, the son said, \"Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, \"If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.'Father,' replied the son, \"I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, \"If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.'Father,' said the son to this, \"I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. \"A carton of pink ping pong balls?'\"A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.'I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, \"but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.'Dear son,' said the father, \"I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. \"Please humour me, dear father.'The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.\"Dearest father,' the son started, \"I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\"Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\"Father,' the son said, \"You've made me very happy yet again.'That night, the son spent on board the tanker.The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.His father visited the young man in hospital. \"My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'Weakly, the son sat up in bed. \"Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'The father held his son's hand tightly. \"Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'\"Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.\"Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.'The son nodded weakly.The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.'Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested.The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.\"I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.`I- I-'Then he diedCredit to u/LatviaSecretPolice", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 38565, "stickied": false, "score": 238, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 18:16:49 2017", "ups": 238}, {"body": "A horse walked into a barSeveral patrons got up and left the bar after seeing a potential danger in the situation.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 270, "stickied": false, "score": 237, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 19:53:27 2017", "ups": 237}, {"body": "My daughter told me this one while we were in the yard playing with the chickens.Her- Hey Mom, why did the chicken cross the road?Me- I don't know, kid, why?Her- It didn't.

She was a real piece of work, and we got together like water and koolaid powder. I would provide us some sweet ganja when she would come over, and we would have copious amounts of ugly-bumping while listening to Tool and Manson, then have deep ass conversations and watch old movies. She moves away, I go on to college, such is life.I get a phone call senior year of college. It's Izzy, she's back in town and wants to catch up. I take her out for dinner and drinks at a modest little pub downtown. She confides in me that she moved to Florida and became a prostitute for three years, tears streaming down her face. How she couldn't break the cycle, and eventually three girls she worked with fucked their asses off and squirreled away money from their gorilla pimp to get her a bus ticket. A la her coming back into town. She had nowhere to stay, so I hopped by the market, got us some vodka and coke, and took her back to my place. Drinking ensues, partaking of more ganja ensues, and next thing I know we're laying in my kitchen floor and she's riding me like a rodeo master. Bareback af but I was too drunk to care. I busted and she pulled off and started blowing me, but stopped and started crying about how many dicks she had to suck in her time in Florida. Feeling terrible I carried her to bed and made her a huge breakfast the next morning, content with offering her use of my place as long as she needed and hoping for a budding relationship. She stonewalled me, saying she had just wanted to catch up and moved in with some sleaze-bagdrug dealer one town over. It took me a long time to get over her. EDIT: RIP my inbox. Sorry I can't get back to everyone. I had surgery and I'm trying to just take it easy for a couple days. However if it is a comfort to anyone here asking, no, it is not the person you think. She lives in a very little backwater town now and has three kids with sleazebag. To all the people telling me to move on and wishing me luck, thank you. Since this debacle I've gotten married and have a kickass life with my wife. To the guy who said my writing was obnoxious; poo poo. And to all the people telling me I had some fault in what happened; you're completely right. I would however like to add that she instigated it. I fought her off once but she kept on going for that sweet, under average penis. I caved. Also I didn't drink vodka and Coke. The Coca Cola was for later, we had screwdrivers and cranberries.

When things deescalated, I managed to sneak to my car with just the baby and her bag. As I was reversing he ran out of the apartment and chased me on foot. That was the last night living with him. I got away after that.I began talking to my family more, but never accepted any help. I have worked for my living since I moved out at 17. I chose to never tell them of the abuse. I got my GED. With a good GED score and 27 on the ACT I got a full scholarship to a junior college where I got my associates in nursing. I graduated as an RN at the age of 21.I am now 25. My daughter is 7. I am in a beautiful relationship with a man that treats me like gold. My daughter doesn't remember any of the really rough times thank goodness. I make really good money and I am a really happy person. I have a little PTSD from the traumatic situations, but it is only stirred up rarely.I regret my decision. Even though I am very happy, I endured very avoidable things. I was in so many dangerous situations. I am lucky to be here. However, the experience taught me to be VERY cautious about who I trust.

In perfect specular reflection, all incident light essentially reflects everywhere off the surface such that the angle of reflection is the angle of incidence. Like the left image here:http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/refln/u13l1d3.gifThis basically means that the surface is \"smooth\" in terms of reflection.  On the other hand, in diffuse reflection, the surface is rough and thus each incident ray is seeing a slightly different surface and thus reflects off at random angles depending on where it lands on the surface.Thus, a mirror is an example of mostly specular reflection when illuminated where a white t-shirt is an example of diffuse reflection (due to the cottons strands making for a very uneven surface)Now, as you've said, an object that is truly black, what is called \"a perfect black-body\", should absorb ALL light in the visible spectrum and thus one should receive no light from it and it should have no reflection under illumination.However, in reality there is no such thing as a perfect black-body and thus all materials will reflect at least SOME light off at least their surface, if not the bulk.   In a similar vein, no material is 100% transparent and it will always reflect and absorb at least some light.But what is happening with a piano is actually a bit more,  because the look is ENGINEERED by having TWO surfaces,  The first layer is a fairly-but-not-totally transparent top layer that has a flat surface.  That means that most of the light gets through it, but a good chunk doesn't and reflects off the front and because of the smoothness of the surface it reflects specularly.  The light that makes it through the quasi-transparent layer then meets the black paint, and is mostly absorbed (though some reflects here too).  Thus, in a nutshell (and I'm totally making up these numbers), you've created a case where you start with 100% light, then a top layer reflects 20% of it specularly and transmits 80% and then the black layer underneath eats the 80%.There's an interesting aside here I'll maybe draw attention to, which is that having multiple layers with different properties is actually the reason for a lot of the \"flavour\" and variety of sights we see (rather than just having a single layer).  And in general, much of what we see CANNOT be modeled by assigning  reflection/albedo properties to a single layer alone. This compounding effect of multiple layers of different properties actually plays a big role in computer graphics, where it is called \"Subsurface scattering\".  I'll drop the wiki to that topic here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scatteringBut it's probably not worth going fully into here, but this is the reason why old CGI moves like Toy Story looked so plasticy (Pixar, of course, brilliantly turned a bug into a feature in that movie).  Because it's not possible to create the kind of visual surfaces we see in real life by treating them as only a single layer with some properties, you have to compound the effect of multiple layers.  There's a lot of aspects to this in the surface of something like a piano (or marble).  It's a multi-layer effect.  And it's also worth noting that although it's often possible to \"cheat\" these effects using only one or two layers, this kind of sub-surface complexity can happen within a single material, and it need not be the case that you literally have multiple spatially separated layers, but rather you have reflections from different depths of the surface of just a single material behaving slightly differently.  So even in a single material you may not be able to model its reflection by treating it as a single surface. (the converse is also the case, it may sometimes be possible to take a real life surface appearance that is physically caused by multiple layers and \"fake\" it with a single layer with specially chosen properties).", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 61074, "stickied": false, "score": 2265, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 17:39:15 2017", "ups": 2265}, {"body": "In modern pianos, the black paint can be covered with a variety of materials, from traditional lacquer to modern polyurethanes and polyester resins, which provide the glossy finish.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 15845, "stickied": false, "score": 62, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 17:18:49 2017", "ups": 62}, {"body": "When light hits an object, several things may happen.The light may be absorbed.

An object that reflects all like this would be perfectly white.Other effects like refraction can also happen, but these are not relevant to the question.All objects do a combination of these effects when they are exposed to light. How an object looks like depends on how much it does each.The wax on top of piano transmits most of the light through, but it also does a notable bit of specular reflection. This means that if there is a bright source of light hitting the piano from the opposite direction, you will see a \"mirror image\" of that thing on the piano. Lesser sources of light will not be seen, as like said before, most of the light goes transmits through the wax, and hits the actual surface of the piano which is black and absorbs almost all of the light.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 25426, "stickied": false, "score": 11, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 17:57:47 2017", "ups": 11}, {"body": "The first thing to understand is the difference between specular reflection and diffuse reflection.  In perfect specular reflection, all incident light essentially reflects everywhere off the surface such that the angle of reflection is the angle of incidence. Like the left image here:http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/refln/u13l1d3.gifThis basically means that the surface is \"smooth\" in terms of reflection.  On the other hand, in diffuse reflection, the surface is rough and thus each incident ray is seeing a slightly different surface and thus reflects off at random angles depending on where it lands on the surface.Thus, a mirror is an example of mostly specular reflection when illuminated where a white t-shirt is an example of diffuse reflection (due to the cottons strands making for a very uneven surface)Now, as you've said, an object that is truly black, what is called \"a perfect black-body\", should absorb ALL light in the visible spectrum and thus one should receive no light from it and it should have no reflection under illumination.However, in reality there is no such thing as a perfect black-body and thus all materials will reflect at least SOME light off at least their surface, if not the bulk.   In a similar vein, no material is 100% transparent and it will always reflect and absorb at least some light.But what is happening with a piano is actually a bit more,  because the look is ENGINEERED by having TWO surfaces,  The first layer is a fairly-but-not-totally transparent top layer that has a flat surface.  That means that most of the light gets through it, but a good chunk doesn't and reflects off the front and because of the smoothness of the surface it reflects specularly.  The light that makes it through the quasi-transparent layer then meets the black paint, and is mostly absorbed (though some reflects here too).  Thus, in a nutshell (and I'm totally making up these numbers), you've created a case where you start with 100% light, then a top layer reflects 20% of it specularly and transmits 80% and then the black layer underneath eats the 80%.There's an interesting aside here I'll maybe draw attention to, which is that having multiple layers with different properties is actually the reason for a lot of the \"flavour\" and variety of sights we see (rather than just having a single layer).  And in general, much of what we see CANNOT be modeled by assigning  reflection/albedo properties to a single layer alone. This compounding effect of multiple layers of different properties actually plays a big role in computer graphics, where it is called \"Subsurface scattering\".  I'll drop the wiki to that topic here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scatteringBut it's probably not worth going fully into here, but this is the reason why old CGI moves like Toy Story looked so plasticy (Pixar, of course, brilliantly turned a bug into a feature in that movie).  Because it's not possible to create the kind of visual surfaces we see in real life by treating them as only a single layer with some properties, you have to compound the effect of multiple layers.  There's a lot of aspects to this in the surface of something like a piano (or marble).  It's a multi-layer effect.  And it's also worth noting that although it's often possible to \"cheat\" these effects using only one or two layers, this kind of sub-surface complexity can happen within a single material, and it need not be the case that you literally have multiple spatially separated layers, but rather you have reflections from different depths of the surface of just a single material behaving slightly differently.  So even in a single material you may not be able to model its reflection by treating it as a single surface. (the converse is also the case, it may sometimes be possible to take a real life surface appearance that is physically caused by multiple layers and \"fake\" it with a single layer with specially chosen properties).", "gilded": 1, "author_comment_karma": 61074, "stickied": false, "score": 2265, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 17:39:15 2017", "ups": 2265}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/77dhtp/how_can_objects_like_a_piano_be_completely_black/", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "An indigenous population has had many generations across the same landmass.

With that being said, how are the gravitational effects of a body, such as a planet or sun, calculated in relation to its size? I'm thinking that for a relatively small dense body, calculating its effect on another body at a relatively great distance would be a matter of calculating the effects of an infinitely small point with equal mass to the actal planet, with the same center of gravity. As if all of the mass of the planet were focused in a single mathematical coordinate in space, rather than distributed over several thousand miles of diameter. This seems like a simple equation, that the force between the 2 bodies would be calculated by their mass and distance, regardless of their respective size. How does this change for objects that are very close together? for example, calculating the pull of gravity of a person standing on its surface? From that distance, the distributiong of mass seems more significant, as it is not all focused in some far off single point, but distributed essentially on a plane that stretches out in every direction from the point where the person is standing, not just directly downward towards the center of the planet. Does that just get insanely complicated and a best estimate is used?Where this could get even more interesting would be calculating the influence of 2 very large, very dense bodies with no atmosphere passing extremely close to each other in space. Like 2 massive planets moving so quickly that they pass each other within a handful of miles without colliding. If the shape of each planet was irregular, it seems the gravitational interaction of various parts of the planet and the distribution of their mass would be crucial to understanding how their respective courses would change after passing. I imagine it would go far beyond the video game approximation of a planete, which would essentially be a massless solid sphere with an infinitely small center of gravity containing all of its mass, so the force of gravity just pulls directly to the core, no matter the distance to the surface.Another thought: how would this change the effect of gravity beneath the surface of the planet? If one were to theoretically dig a hole to the center of the earth, there would be no gravity felt except that of the sun and moon, correct?

How are the specific strains chosen?  I had a few theories backed up by a reasonable rationale in my mind, and I wanna see how close I am to the real answer.  1. **The most infectious, most easily spread strains are prioritized.** Since infectiousness would most directly correlate to maximum loss of productivity across the board, it would make sense for these strains to be vaccinated against. Also, since those with compromised immune systems are more likely to come into contact with highly infectious strains, vaccinating against these strains would provide a herd immunity to protect the vulnerable.  2. **The cheapest vaccinations to produce and manufacture are prioritized.** I am assuming that only a handful of flu strains are characterized well enough to cheaply synthesize a vaccine. Additionally, the seasonal flu vaccine is very cheap, to where pharmacies can administer them for less than 20 dollars. Money and profit is always a motivator when decisions are made.  3. **The deadliest strains are prioritized.** Prioritizing the strains that might be less infectious but have a higher mortality rate would decrease the overall burden on the health care system. I'm guessing that the deadlier strains would result in increased hospital visits and health care costs for a small number of people, compared to a greater number of people with minor symptoms. Vaccinating against the deadliest strains would not only save more lives, but also decrease the burdens on the hospitals and ERs.  4. **The strains that are local to my area are prioritized.** I could be wrong, but flu outbreaks might be local. Protecting against the strains that are local to my area would prevent spreading that specific strain beyond a geographical location, essentially creating a quarantine area.

The louder the sound the greater the pressure. Your ears function by having a layer of skin, the eardrum, which vibrates in response to these pressures and stimulates bones on the inside of your ear, which in turn stimulate the cochlea. So a very loud sound, e.g. a jet engine, creates a very high pressure/amplitude wave. This can then damage the internal machinery of your ear. So in most cases the amount of damage sustained from hearing a sound is related to the absolute amplitude of the wave, the volume, and the amount of time you listen to it for. A very extreme example of this would be an explosion. Explosions create very high pressure waves which can damage the internal machinery of your ear. The way sound cancellation, which you seems to be equating white noise with,works is by creating a wave that destructively interferes with the incoming wave. Here's a link to a more in-depth explanation of the concept: http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/Lesson-3/Interference-of-WavesThe main thing here is that interference is not the same thing as white noise. If you destructively interfere an incoming sound wave then the sound becomes quieter. White noise would just be overriding the original sound with a louder noise, which as I explained above would actually be more dangerous than wearing earplugs.

But I think locality can be expressed, perhaps, in a \"math-lite\" way, so let's try to do that.The principle of locality can be expressed in a few different - though quite related - ways, but I'm just going to explain the most straightforward way of expressing it. In this way, it amounts to a restriction on how and in what way a present state of a system is mathematically allowed to depend on the state of the same system at an earlier time.  Let's imagine how something like a scalar field behaves in time.  A \"scalar field\" is just math talk for basically just a function f(x,y,z,t), meaning that for every point in space (x,y,z) and time (t) there is some number f assigned. It is a \"field\", i.e. something that assigns a mathematical object to every point x,y,z,t, and that mathematical object in this case is a \"scalar\", i.e. just a number (rather than a vector or tensor or whatever).  Thus \"scalar\" \"field\".  An example of a scalar field might be the temperature in the room you're in,  we could call it a \"the temperature scalar field\" and for every point in your room and at a given time there's a defined temperature associated with that point in space and time (say 20 degrees Celsius).  We might call this field, in math language: T(x,y,z,t)  which means it's an object that you plug in an input of an \"x\", a \"y\", a \"z\" and a \"t\" and it returns the temperature \"T\" at that point and time.So what does it mean for this temperature field to obey \"local\" laws of physics?  Well let's imagine I want to determine what the temperature at a specific point (x0,y0,z0) will be at that same spot but at a time that is just the tiniest bit in the future.  If we say the present is t0 then I want to know  what \"T\" will be at the point (x0,y0,z0) but at the time t0+dt where \"dt\" just means \"a small amount\" (an infinitesimal time later, if  you know calculus, if you don't it doesn't matter).  So this is the question, if I want to know T(x0,y0,z0,t0+dt) what do I need to know about T(x,y,z,t0).  Now keep in mind what I mean here, T(x,y,z,t) (x,y,z,t are general variables, not specific values like x0,y0,z0,t0) means complete knowledge of \"T\" at all points in space and time, like I'm a temperature omniscient deity.  But the question I'm asking if I only want to know the value of the temperature at ONE SPECIFIC point in space and time, how much do I need to know about T.  Do I need to know the temperature everywhere at t0, i.e. do I need to know T at x0+2000 km or at z0-3,000,000 km, do I need to know T(x,y,z,t0) for ALL values of x,y and z that can exist?  Everywhere at all times?  Or only some places in t0? etc.If the temperature scalar field obeys \"locality\" then what it means is that the laws of how temperature changes in time are such that if I want to know T(x0,y0,z0,t0+dt)  I ONLY need to know the temperature at that same point a moment earlier T(x0,y0,z0,t0) AND the temperature at points that are immediately next to that point:T(x0+dx,y0,z0), T(x0-dx,y0,z0), T(x0,y0+dy,z0),T(x0,y0-dy,z0), and so on (where dx,dy,dz means a \"tiny bit in that direction\").  In a local theory, the value of at T(x,y,z,t) only depends on the value of T at the same point a moment before as well as its value in some very tiny neighbourhood in its vicinity.  It doesn't depend on T anywhere else but that small neighbourhood.That's what is meant by \"locality\".  If you know your calculus it can be pretty succinctly be described as: the value of T(x0,y0,z0,t0) can only depend on derivatives of T(x,y,z,t) evaluated at (x0,y0,z0,t0) and on external functions (like an external potential) evaluated at (x0,y0,z0,t0).  It can't depend on anything else.So a non-local theory basically has laws dictating its dynamics such that T(x0,y0,z0,t0+dt) depend on the complete knowledge of T(x,y,z,t0) (i.e. you need to know the temperature everywhere in the universe at time t0 to calculate what \"T\" will be at the point x0,y0,z0 and a time t0+dt). If you know Calculus then T(x,y,z,t) might depend on term like integral(T(x,y,z,t)*g(x2,y2,z2,t), integrate over all (x2,y2,z2)) (you can safely ignore this if it means nothing to you).So, in a local temperature theory, if I want to know the temperature in Paris in 1 second, I only need to know the temperature of the air at paris currently and maybe the immediate vicinity. Note that the point here is that 1 second is small, if I want to know the temperature of paris in 4 weeks the \"neighbourhood\" I need to consider may very well grow to be quite large, likely the whole planet, but that's fine and has to do with the FINITE SPEED with which two temperature points T(x0,y0,z0,t0)  and T(x1,y1,z1,t0+ 4 weeks) can be causally linked.

But in order to plan Rosetta's orbit they had to define a non-rotating (inertial) reference frame, centered on the body but having the axes pointing to faraway stars or pulsars instead.Engineers could do that based on pictures and data transmitted by Rosetta.The planning of the actual landing manoeuvre surely required using at least 3 different reference frames to do the math: Rosetta's body frame to define the initial attitude and position of Philae, the inertial reference frame for the trajectory, and the rotating frame for touchdown.Related: https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6itmue/in_earth_travel_we_use_north_south_east_and_west/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 25104, "stickied": false, "score": 11, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 15:41:18 2017", "ups": 11}], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/77cmkj/how_do_space_craft_that_explore_beyond/", "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "green": -1.0}, {"contest_mode": false, "liberal": -1.0, "top_comments": [{"body": "I don't think I understand your question.

It was before my time, but let me explain the gist of things:  In 1983 and 1984, and 1985 there was year round football.  College football and the NFL in the Fall/winter, and the USFL in the Spring/Summer.   The USFL had 18 teams, and owners with comparable access to capital to NFL owners.   As a startup league, the USFL had some instability, with team relocations and difficulty securing venues and stadium leases (and opposition from the NFL). But the on field product was a success, and multiple college stars, future NFL stars, already-NFL-stars, and future football hall of famers were lured to the USFL through aggressive salary offers.Donald Trump wanted to buy an NFL team, but the other owners rejected him.So, what did Donald do?  He did what Donald always does.  He lashed out and tried to force his way in.  He bought the New Jersey Generals and wanted to force a merger bebetween the NFL and USFL.Wikipedia summarizes the result:>In 1985, the USFL voted to move from a spring to a fall schedule in 1986 to compete directly with the NFL. This was done at the urging of New Jersey Generals majority owner Donald Trump and a handful of other owners as a way to force a merger between the leagues. As part of this strategy, the USFL filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the National Football League in 1986, and a jury ruled that the NFL had violated anti-monopoly laws. However, in a victory in name only, the USFL was awarded a judgment of just $1, which under anti-trust laws, was tripled to $3.[2] This court decision effectively ended the USFL. The league never played the 1986 season, and by the time it folded, it had lost over US$163 million.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 58015, "stickied": false, "score": 274, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 20:13:12 2017", "ups": 274}, {"body": "Trump's defining character trait is vindictiveness.

Fact had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, receiving responses from 2,417, of whom 1,189 said Goldwater was mentally incapable of holding the office of president. Most of the other respondents declined to diagnose Goldwater because they had not clinically interviewed him, but claimed that, although not psychologically unfit to preside, Goldwater would be negligent and egregious in the role.[42][43]> After the election, Goldwater sued the publisher, the editor and the magazine for libel in Goldwater v.

Saying more moderate and progressive things, and doing more moderate and progressive things. Does he think Trump is being impeached and starting to ramp up pre-impeachment PR either to become Vice President, or if Mike Pence is also impeached, President?The mental health statements following Las Vegas and going to Puerto Rico and calling it a humanitarian crisis. This is a slight divergence from the Republican platform. Not large enough to be deviant... but interesting. It could just be a blip in the radar, but the people closest in the line of succession might start acting differently if impeachment is probable.I have a tentative theory about Paul Ryan working against Trump and his followers.It's still tinfoil at this point, but considering Romney warned us about Russia in 2012, and we now know Russia has been infiltrating the Republican party for awhile, leads me to believe that the anti-Russian Republicans have been working against them for the last few years. I don't think they knew the full extent of what they were up against until Trump won the primary.Paul Ryan's appointment to speaker is what caused me to question the inner workings of the Republican party. Surprisingly, the most conservative members do not appear to like him, and Paul Ryan himself seems antagonistic compared to other Republicans towards Trump and his policies from the very beginning. This is weird, considering Paul Ryan is, himself, quite conservative and used to be a hero to that conservative wing.There were more senior members in the house that would'e been a better fit for speaker, but Republicans chose him because he was the most powerful conservative. And yet... he didn't want the job. And yet... he was pushed by Boehner and others to take it. Boehner is interesting in how much he despises what is going on with the Republicans right now, and that in and of itself is telling.Paul Ryan is not doubt very conservative, but he seems wary of conservative power. His speakership has been a legislative failure too despite having the votes. Don't forget he's friends with Reince Prieubus who is not on good terms with Trump even before he was fired, and it was believed Reince was undermining Trump's efforts.**Now the next part is crazy so don't take it on face value as being true, but McCarthy, who was not chosen as speaker because of a controversy, and whom Paul Ryan initially supported, told Republican leaders in a meeting that he thought Trump was on Putin's payroll. Paul Ryan said no leaks, and McCarthy said \"Swear to God.\"**Most people say this suggests they are working with the Russians or fear being caught doing something unethical... however, the context of that conversation suggestions suspicion of those leaders knowing about Putin and Trump, and Ryan told them not to leak this information to anyone.*Why?* Could it be they didn't want other Republicans to know?**If you read that transcript of that meeting it is a very anti-Russia meeting and they appeared to know they are the ones standing up to Russia. It happened days before Trump became the nominee. Who was in that meeting? That's the most interesting part. Seriously.****McCarthy, who was taken down. Ryan, who became speaker (because he' conservative, though now he is hated by Republicans for being inefficient), Rodgers (basically a Republican blue dog democrat), and... Scalise.****Who was shot. I think the Russians may have targeted insane liberals to act against members of congress they wanted taken down through social media.**Two members of that conversation were taken out, either politically or in health, and the other two, while seeming to be supporters of Trump... aren't exactly conservative darlings.But the leadership itself remains. Ryan, McCarthy, Scalise, and Rodgers retain their high-ranks.Trump even called Ryan \"disloyal\" and those like him undermining his candidacy as part of a sinister plot.Even more interesting, the ineffective legislator Ryan doesn't seem to scoff at rebuking Russia with legislation and sanctions.Again, however, Paul Ryan is very conservative, and that he is compromised by Russia in some way because all Republicans were since they did not realize Russia's influence until Trump. But I think his recent actions suggest he is preparing to appear more moderate to the American public (which he does not need to do) and more of a national leader, and his past and current statements and actions suggest he is very antagonist towards Trump and Russia.My conclusion is that Russians approached Romney in 2012 and Romney warned Ryan after Russian interference. When McCarthy was taken out, I don't think the Russians and their cronies realized that Ryan wasn't on their side (because he was conservative), and those who were against Russia realized they now had a man on the inside. That moment, when Ryan was tapped as Speaker, is when the fight between Republicans began, but it didn't become vicious until Trump.For Russians out there reading this... if I'm right and I came up with this, those in the US Government know exactly what you did and are working against you. You will lose. You thought you won in November 2016, but you lost in October of 2015.**TL;DR:  Russians are using psychological profiles to target and incite individuals to attack their political enemies in congress.**", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 134, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 20:26:58 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "and all they really needed was Hillary to run against him...", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 45624, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 17:34:47 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "You\u2019re going to want a [VPN](https://join.nordvpn.com/order/).", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 63, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 16:36:41 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "I'd like to see mine.

Of course, part of the internet is anonymity. This system wouldn't block that, as it's purely optional, as author certs could be granted anonymously. So, users could be sure that the article came from the same author as other articles, even if they don't know who the actual author is.

Some exited prostitutes argue prostitution has similarities to rape because it is a form of sexuality that is entirely controlled by the john, as rape is a form of sexuality in which the rapist controls the interaction, disregarding the desires, physical well-being or emotional pain of the victim.[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_prostitution)Also:\"Conceiving of sex as a commodity significantly predicted rape myth acceptance, attraction to violent sexuality, less frequent use of condoms while with prostitutes, support for prostitution, and the attitude that prostitution is positive for women. We argue that that conceiving of sex as a commodity has a number of negative implications for the men involved, their sexual partners, and for gender relations in general.\"Source: \"Conceiving of Sex as a Commodity: A Study of Arrested Customers of Female Street Prostitutes\", by Martin A.

I'm in the process of creating a website called Female Rising. The website will be a place where women who have trauma from any situation ranging from harassment to assault to abuse can share their stories anonymously or not and read other womens stories. They will also have access to a group discussion forum where they can talk to others who understand how they feel and can talk about what they're dealing with and how they're coping and possibly make new friends (the forum will be moderated and rude comments will be blocked). There will be provided links to professional help options. The whole website will be completely costless and safe from hate. Before I have the website go live to those that I do not share the link with, I need stories already published on the site. So if you or a friend or family member of yours has a story to get off their chest please encourage them to send their story to submit@femalerising.org. In the email, please specify if you would prefer to remain anonymous or not. If not, write your first name, age, and state along with your story. Comments are enabled so also specify if you want comments turned off for your story. Horrible people get away with horrible things because they count on us keeping our mouths shut.

I'm posting this to remind everyone that even if you're somewhere you feel safe, never leave your drink alone.I live in a small college town. Last night (a Wednesday of all things) I was at the local brewery catching up with a friend. They close fairly early, so I was about half way through my second beer when they called last call at 9:45. I went up to the bar to pay my tab and left my beer with my friend, but after a minute he followed me up to pay his as well. I didn't even think about the fact that I left my beer alone since there were only about a dozen other people there.I drank a little of it (1-2 inches in the pint glass) fairly slowly while we talked, but I gave it to my friend to finish. He commented that it tasted strange (the brewery has yeast problems some times) but had taken a few big swigs of it by the time I started to feel off. All of a sudden I felt very flushed as if I had a fever, and I could feel my heart beating. I told him I felt weird and we should probably go, but he had a little more before I felt very light headed and I told him to stop drinking. At that point it was hard to tell if I was working myself into a panic attack or if I was actually drugged, but he dropped me off at home and I kept feeling more and more dissociated. About ten minutes later, he texted me saying he was getting lightheaded and he thought I might be right.The rest of the night was pretty steady. I was sluggish and slow, but told my housemates what happened and they put Moana on to calm me down and kept tabs on how I was feeling. It took me forever to eat some crackers because I kept forgetting I had them in my mouth. My friend had it a little worse, though. He texted me to say he was shaking from it, but decided not to go to the hospital since it didn't progress further.Overall, we got very lucky. I let my guard down somewhere I felt safe (a local brewery on a Wednesday evening!) and I feel bad that my friend was affected by it as well, but things could have turned out much worse. It's hard to imagine something like this happening in my town, but I suppose bad people exist everywhere. Please remember not to leave your drinks alone, even for a minute.[Edit] Thank you to those that posted encouragement. It breaks my heart reading how many of you have had similar things happen. To the small group posting about how you don't believe me, while I think all sides of the discussion are important, this really isn't the place to do it. I posted this hoping to remind people to be careful, not to go on trial for if I can trust my own experiences. I've had some time to process it, and I'm 100% sure something was wrong.

One night she didn't feel like asking anymore. (this is in reference that she did not ask for sex that night she just took it. There seems to be confusion that I was talking about the kissing. The mention of kissing is to make it clear how little I wanted that kind of touch with her that I wouldnt even kiss her.)I tried to rationalize and tell myself \"she was just too drunk, she didn't know.\" I was trying so hard to make it out like it was an innocent mistake that I even stayed friends with her until she moved even though being around her made me sick. According to her on that night she was \"black out drunk\" and had no memory of ever touching me.  When she moved though I got to thinking. She never asked me for sex again. She never tried to touch me again. She knew what she did. And I hope to god the reason she never bugged me again was because she was filled with shame for what happened.  A few years back I was in an abusive relationship and became an advocate in having a strong voice against abuse and spreading the word of how easy it is to get teapped. I would tell people my story and more often than not I was asked \"how could you have stayed with someone like that? I could never.\" With so many responses like that I didn't see how anyone would believe me when I said a woman raped me.  I didn't want to get asked how it was possible.

And writing down goals for yourself everyday, being cleaning or setting a goal forthe amount of job applications to complete and what ever else you can think of that can be completed. AND STICK TO IT. The more you do and complete and the closer you get yourself to where you want to be will be helpful to feeling more accomplished and will motivate you more. Although i know it can be tough to see the light on the other side. But it will work if you work it. As far as your son and hia dad. You have the right to feel upset for them for not including you. Although your son's father does not owe it to you to give you little luxuries, but to single you out and to put your son on that bandwagon isnt right. He should not promote negative feels and thought towards you to lead to mistreatment. But i dont know the reasoning that have you being fired or layed off and what your attitude has been since the time you've not been working. I was in a situation where i was paying mostly all the bills for me and my girlfriend while she was looking for a job for about three months and it did create a little resentment for myself towards her. Even with me seeing how hard it was for her to find a job and taking her to interviews and seeing the effort she was putting forward. And it was very hard for emotionally as well. Somedays she didnt want to get out of bed and would cry to me about how sorry she was. And when i would have acted out against her in how i felt i could only imagine it would make it that much harder to be motived through that depression. Given you guys history though, he should be more compassionate towards your hard times. Although i dont recommand acting out on your negative feelings unless just to talk resonable to him and your son and how their actions are effecting you. Although i still retorted with some mean responses when my girlfriend did that to me but after thinking about it i knew she was right that she deserved not to be mistreated.

Good will usually has them quite often and so does aldi with a few other companies that require little to no experience. But getting out of bed is key. And writing down goals for yourself everyday, being cleaning or setting a goal forthe amount of job applications to complete and what ever else you can think of that can be completed.

Although your son's father does not owe it to you to give you little luxuries, but to single you out and to put your son on that bandwagon isnt right. He should not promote negative feels and thought towards you to lead to mistreatment. But i dont know the reasoning that have you being fired or layed off and what your attitude has been since the time you've not been working. I was in a situation where i was paying mostly all the bills for me and my girlfriend while she was looking for a job for about three months and it did create a little resentment for myself towards her. Even with me seeing how hard it was for her to find a job and taking her to interviews and seeing the effort she was putting forward. And it was very hard for emotionally as well. Somedays she didnt want to get out of bed and would cry to me about how sorry she was. And when i would have acted out against her in how i felt i could only imagine it would make it that much harder to be motived through that depression. Given you guys history though, he should be more compassionate towards your hard times. Although i dont recommand acting out on your negative feelings unless just to talk resonable to him and your son and how their actions are effecting you. Although i still retorted with some mean responses when my girlfriend did that to me but after thinking about it i knew she was right that she deserved not to be mistreated.

I don't even think about these things when I'm doing them, they're just how you do things to avoid trouble (whether it's being sexually assaulted or mugged and murdered).

But statistics on men's violence against women, while shocking, only tell part of the story. Another part of the story unfolds in women's daily lives. To demonstrate this concretely, I request the students' participation in an interactive exercise. I draw a line down the middle of a chalkboard, sketching a male symbol on one side, a female symbol on the other. Then I ask just the men: \"What steps do you guys take, on a daily basis, to prevent yourselves from being sexually assaulted?\"At first there is a kind of awkward silence as the men try to figure out if they've been asked a trick question. The silence gives way to a smattering of nervous laughter. Occasionally a young guy will raise his hand and say: \"I stay out of prison.\" This is typically followed by another moment of laughter, before someone finally raises his hand and soberly states \"Nothing. I don't think about it.\" Then I ask the women the same question. \"What steps do you take on a daily basis to prevent yourselves from being sexually assaulted?\" Women throughout the audience immediately start raising their hands. As the men sit in stunned silence, the women recount safety precautions they take as part of their daily routine. Here are some of their answers:Hold my keys as a potential weapon. Look in the back seat of the car before getting in. Carry a cell phone. Don't go jogging at night. Lock all the windows when I go to sleep, even on hot summer nights. Be careful not to drink too much. Don't put my drink down and come back to it; make sure I see it being poured. Own a big dog. Carry mace or pepper spray. Have an unlisted phone number. Have a man's voice on my answering machine. Park in well-lit areas. Don't use parking garages. Don't get on elevators with only one man, or with a group of men. Vary my route home from work. Watch what I wear. Don't use highway rest areas. Use a home alarm system. Don't wear headphones when jogging. Avoid forests or wooded areas, even in the daytime. Don't take a first-floor apartment. Go out in groups. Own a firearm. Meet men on first dates in public places. Make sure to have a car or cab fare. Don't make eye contact with men on the street. Make assertive eye contact with men on the street.The exercise can go on for almost half an hour. Invariably the board fills up on the women's side. This is true, with slight variations, in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Many women say the list is like an unconscious mental checklist. Despite three decades of Take Back The Night rallies and feminist consciousness-raising about the politics of women's safety, surprisingly few women in audiences where I've presented think about their daily routine in terms of larger cultural issues or political questions. \u201cIt's just the way it is,\" they say. \u201cIt\u2019s what we have to do to feel safe.\u201d (At the end of the exercise, I always hasten to point out that most sexual assaults are perpetrated not by strangers lurking in the bushes, but by men who know their victims -- often in the victim\u2019s home.) Some women do get angry when they see the radical contrast between the women's side of the chalkboard, which is always full, and the men's, which is almost always blank.Some men react emotionally when they contemplate the full chalkboard on the women's side. They're shocked, saddened, angered. Many report its effects as life-changing. Many of them had never before taken the time to think about this subject.\u201d- Jackson Katz's, The Macho Paradox: Why Some Men Hurt Women and How All Men Can Help", "libertarian": -1.0, "id": "77cqod", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "Comparing what men and women do to prevent yourself from being sexually assaulted", "num_comments": 81, "conservative": -1.0, "pinned": false, "score": 10, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 24097, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/77cqod/comparing_what_men_and_women_do_to_prevent/", "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 10:38:11 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Could women just be more paranoid than men?

Men may not think about strategies to avoid specific types of danger, but we do practice strategies to avoid a broad spectrum of potential dangers. We don't always practice all the same strategies, but that doesn't mean that we don't have things to worry about - including sexual assault - it just means that there are so many ways things could go to hell in an instant of poor planning that we tend to defend ourselves via the Pareto principle (20 percent of the strategies we can use to protect ourselves will prevent 80 percent of the dangers we are most likely to come across). Because of the common way of teaching this broad approach to men growing up (as opposed to the very specific dangers that are highlighted for women growing up) we often can't articulate which preparations we make to combat one single danger (because there aren't any - each one is meant to deal with a large number of dangers).So, it isn't that we don't take daily precautions, it's just that we don't think of them as meant to deal with one thing as opposed to being meant to keep us safe in general.For example, my daily precautions include carrying a phone, a flashlight (that is round and able to be used as a fist filler), and a pocket knife in an easy to access place (usually in my front pants pocket or clipped to my shirt collar); wearing shoes that I can run in; staying only in well lit, very public, and well maintained places; traveling with friends or family whenever possible; avoiding excessive drinking unless I'm at home or with one of my very very close friends; avoiding alleys, isolated paths, and strangers; and letting someone always know when I'm going somewhere I'm unfamiliar with unless I'm with trusted friends. I don't even think about these things when I'm doing them, they're just how you do things to avoid trouble (whether it's being sexually assaulted or mugged and murdered).

I\u2019m even nervous to share on reddit because I don\u2019t want anyone being mean to me or telling me that mine don\u2019t count or something. I spent most of my life thinking that my experiences were not \u201cbad\u201d enough compared to others so I felt weird sharing them. But they were very traumatic for me and that matters. Even the non typical experiences matter.I grew up very religious and very sheltered from the normal world. I went to a private Christian school and I swear I didn\u2019t even know basic sexual things. Like I didn\u2019t know what a blowjob was until I was 18. I know that sounds a little crazy but I just wasn\u2019t exposed to ANYTHING sexually related. So when I was inappropriately touched in 7th grade, I was in shock and felt confused and very dirty. I refused to even speak for about a week after it until my mom finally begged me to tell her what was wrong with me. I broke down sobbing and told her exactly what happened. I felt so humiliated and ashamed as if I had done something wrong. She was horrified and called the school and called the boys parents. I begged her not to call his parents because I didn\u2019t even want him to know I\u2019d told anyone, I just wanted to pretend like it never happened. The problem was that we had assigned seats in my class and his seat was right next to mine. So luckily they moved his seat somewhere else, but that\u2019s all they did as far as I know. The reason i called it a non typical experience is because what he did was strange and not something I\u2019ve ever heard of someone doing. I\u2019m guessing this is because he may have been just as sheltered as I was, and may have had an urge and not understood how to carry it out. We were having quiet reading time at our desks. Like I said he was sitting next to me, and he started to move his chair closer to mine. When he got his chair close enough he started to take his foot and try to push it under my seated buttocks. I really don\u2019t know how else to describe it and it sounds super weird, but he was determined to push his foot all the way under me. I was confused and at first thought maybe it was an accident but then he persisted and became more and more forceful as I tried moving my chair farther away. Every time I moved my chair he moved his closer again. I tried to think of any possible excuse to stand up. I was shaking and felt like the blood was drained from my body. I had no way to understand what was happening or why he\u2019d be doing this to me. I finally got up and went to the teacher to ask if I could be excused to the bathroom. She told me to wait until after class. I was a very timid kid and had trouble speaking up for myself so I didn\u2019t argue and walked back to my desk filled with dread. The walk to the desk felt like it was in slow motion. It was awful. As I got older I ended up having quite a few \u201cminor\u201d experiences of inappropriate behavior from boys. Another one that stands out is when a boy from my Christian club I was part of in highschool decided to playfully steal my phone and run away with it. I chased after him, very annoyed, and he ran to a secluded area where nobody could see us. I\u2019m short so he had a good old time holding my phone up very high so I had to keep jumping for it. After a couple jumps he started grabbing my boobs and grabbing my ladybits and laughing as if this was a game to him. I was livid. I knew how to speak up for myself better by this point and I elbowed him in the stomach, got my phone and ran to tell someone. Our parents made us meet up at a library with them to discuss the incident and to decide whether we were getting the cops involved. He was sobbing and clearly looked terrified. Because of my devotion to Christianity at the time I took pity on him and didn\u2019t involve the police. Years later I found out he went on to rape several girls in our highschool and beyond. Like a LOT of girls. I could have been the first. And I could have helped prevent those future rapes. I think about it all the time.Those are my two biggest, but there have been numerous drunken boob grabs, comments, etc. One of the most common things I\u2019d hear growing up (even at a very young age, though I had no idea what they meant until after 18 yrs old or so) was \u201cdoes the carpet match the drapes\u201d because I\u2019m a redhead. After I discovered what that meant I was appalled at how many times I\u2019d heard it, starting at a very young age. Early middle school I\u2019m guessing. Anyways, sorry for the length.

So, for example, while losing 1% of your bodyweight at 200lbs would be 2lbs per week, losing 1% at 150lbs is only 1.5lbs per week.I know this seems very simple, but I've personally found it incredibly disheartening to see my weight seemingly plateau when just a few weeks prior I'd been progressing in leaps and bounds.If you like, and if you're comfortable with it, it's a good idea to weigh yourself every day just after you've woken up (before eating anything). I like to track my weight in an Excel sheet so I can see long-term trends, but I know that's not for everyone.Also, don't get too hung up on a number. As someone who can be a bit obsessive about these things, I know my weight can fluctuate daily up and down by as much as a few pounds, even if I'm doing all the \"right\" things. It's very easy to think \"If I weigh exactly X amount, then everything will be better,\" but it's far healthier to look at your body and decide what you do and don't want to change, regardless of any measurements (although I know this can be *very* hard to be objective about).Also, I'd strongly recommend starting slow and getting yourself into an exercise routine before looking at your diet. If you try to do too much too fast you'll likely burn yourself out and get disheartened, which I've struggled with myself.For a personal example, I currently excercise four times a week for between half an hour to an hour each session. I also do about three hours' food prep on Saturdays so I can cook and eat throughout the week without needing to break my diet with fast food.However, it's taken me about four years to get to this point, and I started out going just once a week and then gradually increasing. I didn't even start properly looking at my diet until the start if this year, so please don't feel like you have to do everything at once.Just start with something you know you can handle and make it a part of your routine, and build from there.Finally, it never really gets \"fun\", but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I know it might sound like I'm a bit of a gym junkie, but if I could wave a magic wand and have my perfect body while eating nothing but cheeseburgers and sitting on the couch, I'd do it in a heartbeat.But I know that'll never happen, so instead I try to take pride in what I've accomplished so far, and look at setting reasonable goals for the future. You may never look like the people on TV (although congratulations if you do), but you can look like the best version of yourself, who's probably a happier and healthier person anyway.

If I ever decide to treat myself, I buy only the amount for that treat session, because I will eat all of it guaranteed. I also make my own lunches too, because buying lunch is extremely expensive, and it's also far more unhealthy.I've also basically cut everything down too. Milk I drink light version.

Instead take pictures. Pictures will seriously help you see the difference. Weighing scales are the fucking enemy to progress and will only make you feel bad. There are too many variables that affect \u201cweight\u201d. Use the mirror instead.Consistency is key: Murdering yourself once or twice a week won\u2019t do much but it sounds like you already know this and your current plan looks great.Eye to the sky: when cardio gets easier don\u2019t try to run further instead try throwing in some body weight exercises at the end for a better affect. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re ready to do that.Sugar: remove all forms of sugar from your diet.

Count what you're eating (you may enjoy myfitnesspal or similar tools), set a target amount for an appropriate and achievable deficit (again, 1lb/week is the practical target), and don't eat more than that.  Exercising can mean you get to eat some more calories and maintain that deficit, but probably not near as many as you want.  For general health, your best bet is to just get moving in any way.

If I ever decide to treat myself, I buy only the amount for that treat session, because I will eat all of it guaranteed. I also make my own lunches too, because buying lunch is extremely expensive, and it's also far more unhealthy.I've also basically cut everything down too. Milk I drink light version. Breakfast I cut back by 1/4. Lunches I've cut back to 2 pieces of fruit and a sandwich. Dinners are light too. I've lost about 9kg in 3 months, so I'm reasonably happy with the progress.

You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re ready to do that.Sugar: remove all forms of sugar from your diet.

So, for example, while losing 1% of your bodyweight at 200lbs would be 2lbs per week, losing 1% at 150lbs is only 1.5lbs per week.I know this seems very simple, but I've personally found it incredibly disheartening to see my weight seemingly plateau when just a few weeks prior I'd been progressing in leaps and bounds.If you like, and if you're comfortable with it, it's a good idea to weigh yourself every day just after you've woken up (before eating anything). I like to track my weight in an Excel sheet so I can see long-term trends, but I know that's not for everyone.Also, don't get too hung up on a number. As someone who can be a bit obsessive about these things, I know my weight can fluctuate daily up and down by as much as a few pounds, even if I'm doing all the \"right\" things. It's very easy to think \"If I weigh exactly X amount, then everything will be better,\" but it's far healthier to look at your body and decide what you do and don't want to change, regardless of any measurements (although I know this can be *very* hard to be objective about).Also, I'd strongly recommend starting slow and getting yourself into an exercise routine before looking at your diet. If you try to do too much too fast you'll likely burn yourself out and get disheartened, which I've struggled with myself.For a personal example, I currently excercise four times a week for between half an hour to an hour each session. I also do about three hours' food prep on Saturdays so I can cook and eat throughout the week without needing to break my diet with fast food.However, it's taken me about four years to get to this point, and I started out going just once a week and then gradually increasing. I didn't even start properly looking at my diet until the start if this year, so please don't feel like you have to do everything at once.Just start with something you know you can handle and make it a part of your routine, and build from there.Finally, it never really gets \"fun\", but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I know it might sound like I'm a bit of a gym junkie, but if I could wave a magic wand and have my perfect body while eating nothing but cheeseburgers and sitting on the couch, I'd do it in a heartbeat.But I know that'll never happen, so instead I try to take pride in what I've accomplished so far, and look at setting reasonable goals for the future. You may never look like the people on TV (although congratulations if you do), but you can look like the best version of yourself, who's probably a happier and healthier person anyway.

could.that i have been better off when compared to so many of the other girls, who have shared our two words.but, me too.me too.me too.from that time that i was dragged into your car, when i was saying that i shouldn\u2019t leave my friends, and you promised it would be but a minute.when i let you take my shirt off.must have been my fault, because it didn\u2019t have a back, and i knew i wouldn\u2019t have been allowed out of my house if my father had seen it.when i sat there, half naked, you unzipped your pants and put my hand over your lap.i said no, i didn\u2019t want to.you started to masturbate as you locked the car.i watched as the windows fogged as i looked out for help while you asked if i could \u201cjust suck it a little.\u201di waited for you to finish before i could clothe myself.my friends had to hide me in a corner so that i could later fix myself, as my top had so obviously been left inside out in my hurry.how i left feeling embarrassed of what i had done. i was ashamed that i had not obliged.or the time i woke up in your bed, and thought i had slept with someone else.of when i saw it was you, i remembered being passed around the night before.how i felt if i slept with you again that morning, it wouldn\u2019t be as big a deal.how i describe it as the \u201ccool time i had a foursome.\u201dhow i felt because i was drunk, i couldn\u2019t blame anyone but me.how that set the precedent for all of those times people let me sleep with them, when i clearly wasn\u2019t myself.how i couldn\u2019t even write that, without blaming anyone but me.or that time i was in control until i started drinking the drinks you made, with whatever you added into them.when my best friend and i fell up your stairs, butt naked, your hands on our backs.where neither of us remember doing so.where i don\u2019t remember anything but you making me kiss her, crying, saying i didn\u2019t want to do that.how she told me she had run away, naked  on the bathroom floor, clad only in her own vomit, until you picked her back up and brought her to bed.when i woke in the morning to you inside of me, as i rolled over and saw that she was still in the bed, sleeping, hair crusted over.when i asked you to wear a condom, and you said it would be fine, having never left my body.how i felt again, it was fine, everything was fine, because i was conscious for the second part.or the time i went home with you, as i had happily before, thinking you were a decent man, and i was so happy to see you again.when i was kept together and excited to play video games with you, to catch up with you, as we had innocently all night. when you ended up bringing your friend home with us,when i ignored my uneasy feeling,when suddenly both of you were naked, because he promised the friend that i was the \u201cbest head either of them will ever have.\u201dwhen the friend seemed embarrassed, seemed to pity me as i started to cry, but remained naked as he hugged me and pushed me down until i was by his crotch.how when i begged not to, he left the room and they both came back a minute later telling to me to take myself home, at four in the morning.how i didn\u2019t do anything wrong, apart from falling for someone some time before.how i haven\u2019t told anyone really what happened that night.any of the nights.how i refuse to post this on social media, because there are people i care about that i don\u2019t want to worry,because there\u2019s been so much wrong with me, it\u2019s not fair to anyone to tell them that, me too.me too.me too.", "libertarian": -1.0, "id":

Whoever gets the most votes in those electorates gets a seat in parliament.&nbsp;-Party Vote  This vote is for the political party the voter chooses. And largely decides the total number of seats each political party gets in Parliament.&nbsp;Here are the results of the election.  National - 44.4% (56 seats)  Labour - 36.9% (46 seats)  Green party - 6.3% (8 seats)  NZ First - 7.2% (9 seats)  ACT - 0.5% (1 seat, they got this seat because they won a electorate, so they will have one person in parliament even though they didn't meet the 5% threshold.)&nbsp;(there are other smaller party's which got above 0.01% of the vote but don't get into parliament because they either 1. didn't meet the 5% threshold or 2. didn't win a electorate seat)&nbsp;From the party vote percentages above. No party has a majority of seats in parliament which is 61 seats. So the two major parties National and Labour need to go into coalition with smaller parties to get to that 61 seat majority.&nbsp;Now Labour+Greens have a Memorandum of Understanding in short means they're best of buddys. So Labour will always go to the greens first for coalition discussions. So in total together they have 54 seats (still short of the majority)&nbsp;So National and Labour+Greens both need NZ First to get passed that 61 seat requirement.

Labour even overtakes National at one point. On Election Night, National wins a plurality of the vote.

They are a nomadic people and do not comply with international standards of property ownership.  They believe in squatting and are a culture of squatters.Let's say I own a 50 acre lot of land.  I have a bill of sale and a deed with the legal description of the land.  A neighbor builds a fire pit on my land and a shed.  The use of land goes unnoticed for 40 years.  So then I sell the 50 acre lot of land to real estate developers who are looking to use every acre of it to build over 200 homes.The developer demolishes the guy's shed and fire pit.  He gets angry, declares he has squatter's rights.  So who is right, the developer or the squatter.  Under the rules of most nations of the world the developer owned the land and had every right to it.... he has the legal deed.  The squatter wasn't paying property taxes on that land.  The squatter wasn't leasing that land.  The squatter had no legal avenue for that land.So the Bedouins are a culturally normadic people which in modern times means they are a culturally squatting people.  They don't own property and they don't recognize the ownership of property.So 8 European countries funding mobile clinics and mobile aid centres for the Bedouins.  Problem is... they didn't own or lease any of the land they used for these.  The Israeli government honored any Jordanian land deeds to any former Jordanian or Palestinian who had one.  All other land was taken by the government and auctioned off for development.So the Israelis are arguing that the Europeans are building illegal structures on their land in order to strengthen Palestinian claims to those lands for future bartering purposes.  Israel on the other side wants those areas depopulated so that they can say no one lives there.Area C is unique.  It has both Israeli and Palestinians in the area... and has always had both in the area.  Even under Jordanian rule Jewish settlers (who now call themselves Israeli) lived in that area.  It is also one that the Oslo Accords made no decision on.  The agreement was that Sites A and B (Hebron, Jericho and northern West Bank) would become Palestine and Jerusalem and Bethleham would be up for debate still.The Israelis pulled out of Sites A and B and handed them over to the Palestinians.  They scheduled a Palestinian election for 1999.  If Palestine could hold a monitored and successful election Israel agreed to pull out and end its claims to Site C.That didn't happen.  Palestine held an election in 2006 which elected the HAMAS government.  The HAMAS government's first act of government was to tear up the agreement.So now the peace process is over.  Israel has already given up legal claims of Site A and B in the name of peace but are going to hold on to Site C and try and push developments.  Europe ascertains that the developments are illegal according to the Oslo Accords... which both Israel and Palestine both consider to be invalid... unless it suits their current interests.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 74393, "stickied": false, "score": 11, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 22:58:34 2017", "ups": 11}, {"body": "Maybe instead of building illegal structures and have them demolished, prompting a diplomatic clash and material damage, just lobby to have more permits granted, or perhaps help the impoverished in areas B and A?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 7701, "stickied": false, "score": 8, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 18:39:38 2017", "ups": 8}], "subreddit": "worldnews", "selftext": "", "libertarian": 0.2307143062, "id": "77c4cx", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "title": "8 European countries demand Israel pay for West Bank structures it destroyed", "num_comments": 442, "conservative": 0.1754143387, "pinned": false, "score": 720, "over_18": false, "author_link_karma": 2822, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/77c4cx/8_european_countries_demand_israel_pay_for_west/", "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 08:08:19 2017", "spoiler": false, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Is Palestine gonna pay for the structures their terrorists rocket attacks have destroyed...?

Saudi Arabia is guilty of some terrible human rights violations, I'm not contesting that. I want to be clear on that.The human rights council is composed of 47 member states of which:The membership shall be based on equitable geographical distribution, and seats shall be distributed as follows among regional groups:Group of African States (13)Group of Asia-Pacific States (13)Group of Eastern European States (6)Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (8)Group of Western European and other States (7)Of which the middle east is in the 13 country Asian group.The members of the Council shall serve for a period of three years and shall not be eligible for immediate re-election after two consecutive terms.According to the UN there are 48 countries in this group. This means at any one time >25% of Asian countries are members of the UN HRC. Then these countries have to be cycled through somewhat as they cannot stand\u200b for immediate re-election after two terms. So where do you find at least 26 (over 54%) countries in Asia (the whole world even) who aren't guilty of human rights violations? Good luck.Being elected to the HRC isn't a merit award for good behaviour and going X years without a genocide. It's a council designed to progress human rights in a global and culturally diverse manner. It would be fucking useless if they had a council composed of Sweden and Denmark as permanent members that just lecture people on what a shit job they're doing. No one would listen to them, even within the western world. Even my own country, Australia, is currently committing pretty big human rights violations with indefinite detention of refugees many of which have died under our care due to the poor conditions. These actions have been explicitly condemned by the HRC at least half a dozen times in the past few years. No country is perfect, especially not 47 of them. Expecting a council filled with countries with clean human rights records will get you the emptiest set of 47 chairs you've ever seen.If you want the council to be effective even those countries with poor human rights records need to be represented because there'll always be someone with the worst record. You'll never get cooperation if they're excluded from the process and being lectured to by people halfway across the world in a completely different culture and society. When they have their own representative there it gives the council legitimacy and adds huge weight to any decisions coming from them. It's better that Saudi Arabia be in the council and included in the process and assist in furthering human rights globally and within its own country than to exile them and cause them to block out anything anyone else says while they go about their beheadings.The full list of current members:Albania, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, China, Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Paraguay, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, VenezuelaDon't know about anyone else but a good portion of those names were making my \"known for human rights violations\" senses tingle.heres the actual comment that is formatted https://np.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/6scmlk/my_hotel_in_spain_has_the_united_nations/dlbzvqa/", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4960, "stickied": false, "score": 79, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 22:39:09 2017", "ups": 79}, {"body": "I always imagined UN Human rights as a toilet.

Saudi Arabia is guilty of some terrible human rights violations, I'm not contesting that. I want to be clear on that.The human rights council is composed of 47 member states of which:The membership shall be based on equitable geographical distribution, and seats shall be distributed as follows among regional groups:Group of African States (13)Group of Asia-Pacific States (13)Group of Eastern European States (6)Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (8)Group of Western European and other States (7)Of which the middle east is in the 13 country Asian group.The members of the Council shall serve for a period of three years and shall not be eligible for immediate re-election after two consecutive terms.According to the UN there are 48 countries in this group. This means at any one time >25% of Asian countries are members of the UN HRC. Then these countries have to be cycled through somewhat as they cannot stand\u200b for immediate re-election after two terms. So where do you find at least 26 (over 54%) countries in Asia (the whole world even) who aren't guilty of human rights violations? Good luck.Being elected to the HRC isn't a merit award for good behaviour and going X years without a genocide. It's a council designed to progress human rights in a global and culturally diverse manner. It would be fucking useless if they had a council composed of Sweden and Denmark as permanent members that just lecture people on what a shit job they're doing. No one would listen to them, even within the western world. Even my own country, Australia, is currently committing pretty big human rights violations with indefinite detention of refugees many of which have died under our care due to the poor conditions. These actions have been explicitly condemned by the HRC at least half a dozen times in the past few years. No country is perfect, especially not 47 of them. Expecting a council filled with countries with clean human rights records will get you the emptiest set of 47 chairs you've ever seen.If you want the council to be effective even those countries with poor human rights records need to be represented because there'll always be someone with the worst record. You'll never get cooperation if they're excluded from the process and being lectured to by people halfway across the world in a completely different culture and society. When they have their own representative there it gives the council legitimacy and adds huge weight to any decisions coming from them. It's better that Saudi Arabia be in the council and included in the process and assist in furthering human rights globally and within its own country than to exile them and cause them to block out anything anyone else says while they go about their beheadings.The full list of current members:Albania, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, China, Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Paraguay, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, VenezuelaDon't know about anyone else but a good portion of those names were making my \"known for human rights violations\" senses tingle.heres the actual comment that is formatted https://np.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/6scmlk/my_hotel_in_spain_has_the_united_nations/dlbzvqa/", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 4960, "stickied": false, "score": 82, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 22:39:09 2017", "ups": 82}, {"body": "Doesn't matter what you do as long as you have money ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1732, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 22:47:56 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "NYT Just published that today **Pakistan, Land of the Intolerant**https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/pakistan-muslims-ahmadis.html**The truth about forced conversions in Thar- The Hindu community in the desert region fears for its faith, and with good reason.**https://www.dawn.com/news/1345304And similar stories about shias and Christians are just Google Search away.

Edit: I guess I should add that the community canine is the most basic, \"You're dog behaves in public on this one or two instances it was tested\" test there is.

Is fully understanding an issue before you form an opinion a bad thing these days??---------------------------------There's *A LOT* of 'reddit lawyers' in threads like this.  This specific case is not a clear as many here would like to think.  And look - I'm not trying to convince you of either side.  My goal is to inform you of both sides, so you can decide for yourself.  So there's a lot of memeing around the internet of an old SCOTUS case, *[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_State_Board_of_Education_v._Barnette)* which did indicate that general education students could not be forced to salute the flag under penalty.  More specifically, \"it was unconstitutional for public schools to compel students to salute the flag\" **in contradiction of their own beliefs.**But think about this for a second - is that what's happening in this new OK law?  Is the OK law saying \"YOU MUST SALUTE THE FLAG!!\" or is the OK law saying \"You may not protest during the national anthem.\"  Its not splitting hairs; this is an incredibly important question, as one is illegal, and the other is (probably) legal as schools have been given very wide latitude to control the when/where of student protests at school activities. Does the action of saying 'you need to stand still for 60secs' constitute saluting the flag?  Also if a school says 'now is not the time/place you are allowed to protest' does that impinge a students' 'school speech' rights?  Note that schools have been given *very* wide latitude to control the when/where of student speech, as SCOTUS as determined that the schools' educational mission supersedes a number of constitutional protections that are granted to the general population.  Importantly, this is not an easy question, and if your opinion is something like, \"Well its *obviously* [insert whatever]...\", I seriously question if you are truly understanding all sides of the issue and the scope of the fundamental question as we can debate this topic a lot, but we should all be able to see there **is not** an obvious answer.There was another case, *Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.*.  From the ACLU: \"the Supreme Court ruled that students do not \"shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\" The case involved students who were suspended for going to school wearing black arm bands to protest the war in Vietnam. The court stated that students retained their constitutional rights within the school as long as their actions did not represent a disruption of educational activities.\"  In my opinion, this is an interesting precedent, and it turns on how 'disruptive' kneeling for the national anthem (or generally protesting the national anthem) would be considered.  This is really a jump ball, and if this gets litigated, this is where you will see most of the legal hand-fighting. Roberts is a pretty big 1A champion so I would imagine he'd hold the state to a pretty high standard when determining whether or not there is a compelling reason to suppress the student speech.  But pause to consider that the *Tinker* case was to protect a passive protest (eg black armbands to protest Vietnam War) that was largely silent.  How does that apply to an active protest? This is another question for the court.On the other hand, and in the schools favor is *Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier* in which SCOTUS decided that \"school[s] need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with 'its basic educational mission'...even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school.\"  So a question for the court would be: is national anthem protest contrary to 'its basic educational mission.'  If the school can argue this, then the OK law is probably constitutional.  The notion of 'passive' versus 'active' protest will come up again here.    Importantly, all of the above is for the general student body **ONLY**.  As for as the athletes/cheerleaders go, the OK law is probably completely legal: *Board of Education v. Earls* and *Vernonia School District v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646* both severely limited constitutional protection for students participating in extracurricular activities.  These were both drug testing cases, but the ruling were written very broadly and specifically granted schools the ability to enforce its own policies.  Anyway, the point is that these laws could lead to some really interesting legal challenges.  Irrespective of your individual opinion of kneeling, I hope we can agree that these laws are not 'obviously illegal' as most of reddit seems to think.  In fact, I think you could *potentially* see a pretty big FedCir/SCOTUS case come from one of the laws over the next 3-4 years.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 137909, "stickied": false, "score": -18, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 19 18:41:28 2017", "ups": -18}, {"body": "Children need discipline.
