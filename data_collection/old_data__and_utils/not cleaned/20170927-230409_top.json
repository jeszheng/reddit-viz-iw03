Cline invented the word \"gunter\" for it, referring to \"easter egG hUNTERs,\" which are people hunting the treasure at the center of the novel's plot. I've never hated a made up word as much as I hate the word \"gunter.\" I'm not sure if it's his drastic overuse of the word, the generally shit quality of the writing, story, characters, themes, and ideas of the novel, or the fact that he uses it in phrases like \"My only plan after graduation was to become a full-time gunter.\" and \"I'd worked my way down the entire recommended gunter reading list.\" It's just a shitty all-consuming identity for the main character to fulfill, along with the rest of the primary cast, rather than be dynamic, fleshed out characters that grow throughout the story. Which they do practically none of.\n\nSeriously, the novel's idea of dynamic characters is when you find out a character that was assumed to be regular ol' hetero male turns out to be a fat black lesbian, and when two characters who were assumed to be brothers, we're actually just friends. What a twist! Of course, the girl he assumed to be a smoking hot woman turns out to in fact be a smoking hot woman that can't stop slobbering over his knob.

I prefer to immerse myself into the world and 'facade' of the character, to do that successfully I require the physical intricacies of each character.  The most competent of writers inextricably tie a character's appearance with their personality, using descriptive language of the physical to convey the initially indiscernible to the reader from the moment we're introduced to them.

It's a character who immediately assumes they're superior to others.\n\nI guess each reader has their own preferences when it comes to writing, that's why we have so many diverse authors to satisfy our personal stipulations before we buy their works.

I mean, I can accept time travel or dimensions pretty fast. Just like ghosts, vampires, zombies, whatever. Write it down and I'm on board. I do not need half of the book to consist of main characters who are trying to figure out what's going on. Sure, you don't have to believe it right off the bat, but the concept of \"Time travel\" should not be news to you. And every fucking time another person is introduced to this fact it's like \"What is this strange time with metal horses?\" And every character goes through these same motions whenever they time travel. So what we have is 80% funny and creative comparisons of a plane to a metal bird and 20% story. Tiresome.\n\n2) Sex. Maybe sex is my own problem and it seems foreign when mentioned, but if I am reading a serious book and the author goes in detail about some barmaids \"hard nipples\" and \"wet pussy\", it always seems strange. It always seems like I've entered another realm now, where author uses words he doesn't use in any other instance. You can actually feel the beginning of a \"sex scene\". The author gets all mushy and weird. Some do it good (Nick Cave) by interlacing everything with sex. It's all charged with sex. Some just say \"We gon' talk 'bout dicks for a while now, hang on, this gon' be an awkward ride.\" And then you just crawl through his idea of an interesting description of the \"musky smell of her vagina\" and whatnot.\n\n3) \"A scene like from a book...\" or \"how can one describe...\" I don't know, mate! Maybe you should get an author up in this book, maybe he would be good with words, you know?\n\n4) The main protagonist is a writer or a journalist. I want to do research and find out how many of Top100 books have a main protagonist a writer. I understand, you know no other profession, but come on. Work for 3 months in a forestry or something so that I could get a different protagonist. Tom Clancy did real good with this. \"This guy right here is a submarine captain. There. And he probably hates writing, but isn't an antagonist.\"\n\n5) I'm awful with names and this usually comes in Russian books. The same person can be called \"Alex\", \"Alexander\", \"Sasha\", \"Nikolayev\", \"Ivanovich\", \"leutenant\". That's ignoring the whole \"Brother\" \"father\" relative thing. And when you have 10 characters, you can just as well tell the story to my by saying \"So one dude told another dude.\" I know it's my own fault here, but it has ruined books for me.\n\n6) \"Ah, but now I'm getting too ahead of the story...\" or \"But that's a story for another time.\" Then don't write it! And it's always some shit like \"That was the last time I saw Susan. For she got murdered by the horse-zombies from the planet Neighbiru, but that's a story for another time.\" Well, now I feel like I'm wasting my time reading about the -pre-murder Susan, know what I mean? And there is no need to drop hints about the story like some annoying person in the theater. I know you know the story better than me. You wrote it. Can I please at least try to enjoy it?\n\n7) Description of overly complicated futuristic homes and schematics. You've lost me on the third sentence about the \"whachamacallit valve reaching out of hexagonical opening of interwebbed pipeline network.\" Again, some might enjoy it, sure. But I'm just trying to get past that whole shebang til the story picks up again. I do not have the capacity to envision the exact same room or spaceship than you do. Can you do a picture?

Then I look up from the gas pump and this woman parked in front of my car, she stomped out of her SUV with a small pistol.

I poured some of the contents out, and what was supposed to be clear, plain drinking water turned out to be a black slurry with plenty of fine, black, grainy substances, mixed with some coarse, light brown flakes.\n\nYou see, in my country, there is a teacher in each school that is assigned to handle all disciplinary cases in school. Coincidentally, the incident above happened during her class, so I just told her about the incident.

However, when I went home, I loudly narrated the incident to my cousin, making sure that my mother who was in the adjacent room could hear it. As you can expect, my mother was livid due to the attempt to harm her kid, doubly so for the school attempting to cover it up.\n\nI don't remember much further details, but I remember my mother going to the school and raising a huge fuss over this in front of the headmaster / staff. Several days later, it was revealed that an upperclassman (which I never spoke to) did that. Well, he kinda confessed many days later, but I'm not sure his reasons or motives for spiking my drink or confessing. Anyway, a forced apology was given, and the contents of the spiked materials were revealed to include:\n\n* Pencil shavings\n* Crushed pencil lead (possibly mechanical pencil lead)\n* Glue\n* 1-year-old vinegar left behind the classroom from the previous classroom \"experiment\" preserving fruits with vinegars\n* Chalk, as in blackboard chalk\n\nI am not sure how lethal this would be, but granted that the intent was there, and this has been committed by a primary school kid at a small village where the nearest healthcare facility is 88 kilometres away, I still find this incident bone-chilling.

But one day he got into a fistfight with some random guy at the gas station (where he liked to drink for 20 hours straight) and when he got home he was in a really bad mood.

He got so angry you wouldn't believe it, he started screaming and threw bottles and other stuff at us. He grabbed my brother (who was six years old) and punched him as hard as he could, and while I dragged him to the bed so he could lie down my father called my mother and told her that he's going to end it and she can come pick up the corpses in an hour. I heard this and locked the door to our room, which made him even angrier. He was trying to break down the door with his bare hands, that didn't work so he tried breaking the lock with a knife. Suddenly I hear some really loud noises followed by a bunch of voices yelling, the police broke the door to the apartment and stormed in. Father got arrested, my mother was so scared she looked like she was about to die and I had to talk to a police officer for an hour about what happened. My father was not allowed to contact us again after this but sometimes he would hang out in the street where our new apartment was or he would come to our school and pretend that he was there to pick us up.

He had, however, it's complicated and how I told her and when I told her were not appropriate.  For instance, our relationship had/has (we are in the process of divorcing as I write this) been abusive as long as I can remember.  Mostly verbal and emotional abuse, constant blame even for things that don't warrant blame.  Like, for instance, a flat tire would be my fault because I'm \"too stupid to drive\".  He had no accountability.  In 10 years I never heard him once express genuine regret or a genuine apology.  He is the worlds biggest victim and no one ever helps him.  Everything is always my fault because I'm inept, stupid, a whore, a pig, lazy, whatever.\n\nWe were off and on for nearly 6 years when he began raping me.  His logic was that I had taken a job he didn't think was good enough.  I'd tried to switch careers and \"failed\".  I mean, not really, I worked in the field, it's just where I was it was oversaturated and I didn't fit in a hospital environment.  I had a string of failures and ended up taking a part time job bagging groceries just to get out of the house.  He took this as an opportunity to shit on everything about me and why I never measure up.\n\nDue to the unrelenting criticism and belittling I stopped wanting to sleep with him, so he in turn raped me one day, claiming it was the only thing I brought to the table and if I wasn't willing to give it he had the right to take it.  He has recently said to me \"I have the right to be cruel to you when you don't do what I say.\"  I mean, a real sociopath.  He believes he has every right to be cruel to me if I'm not his constant changing picture of perfection.\n\nOf course, after the initially raping I felt very trapped.  I still loved him, didn't feel like I had anywhere else to go, and was emotional beaten down near suicidal.  The rape made me want to sleep with him even less, which made he want to rape me even more.  It got to a point where rape was habitual.  One night I called a suicide hotline and ended up being taken to the ER.  This was a shitshow clusterfuck.  He ended up kicking me out after that.  Or, rather, he told me to leave.  So, I did.\n\nI took him back, I guess, out of desperation.  I was 30 and desperately wanted to be married and have a baby.  Didn't want to start over.  He weasled his way back in, promised he would never do that again, got me pregnant, married me.  Everything was great for about a year and a half.  Then he reverted back to being abusive.  To his credit, he never raped me again, however the other abuse got extremely worse, especially now that we have a child together.\n\nAnyways, about three months ago I fled the apartment we lived in with our toddler and went to stay with my mother who rents the upper half of the house he and I own jointly.  I have suggested he get counseling for depression and PTSD and that we revisit marriage counseling.  He claimed we had no money for that, but he was spending it all on a hack divorce lawyer.\n\nWell, he came over one day and we had a huge fight about whatever, I have no idea.  I brought up the rape, which - tbf - I think we agreed we'd never bring up again.  We both sort of made an agreement that getting married nullified the habitual rape as long as it never reoccurred, which it didn't, so it felt like I was breaking some kind of fucked up pact.\n\nAnyways, shit spiraled out of control and I ended up getting on FB messenger and unloading on his mother, telling her everything over messenger.  That her son is a sociopath and a rapist and that he had been incredibly abusive for years and refuses to seek help.  She was pretty much leveled and that was pretty much the coup d'etat of our relationship.  There was simply no coming back from that.\n\nI tried to back pedal a little, realizing that regardless I have no evidence and we still need to find a way to co-parent with each other.  However, I'd let my emotions get the best of me and I unloaded on the wrong person.  I shut the door to any possible fixing of the situation because I'd decided that there was no fixing it and I shouldn't've done that.  It really fucked a lot of shit up.  I should've taken the appropriate avenues if I wanted to make that complaint - not told his mother on him.  TBF, again, she knew about a lot of the abuse and had told me to contact her if I needed advice.  My intent was really to expose how abusive he really is and how desperately he needs therapy, because she wasn't encouraging him to get therapy.  She genuinely believes he is a perfect, infallible, genius and that even when he lies he does so because he's so damn smart he's just ahead of the game or something.  Like, when he lies he's doing so for the greater benefit.  She has literally defended his lies like this, that we are just too stupid to understand her genius sons motivations for being a big fat fucking liar.\n\nAnyways, I shouldn't've done it the way I did it, and I regret that.  I got angry and did the wrong thing.  But, it was bound to come out sooner or later.  I have to say, as much as I regret that motion, I regret just about everything else about our relationship a lot more.\n\nOther than our child.  She's awesome, and once the courts realizes what an abusive sociopath he is, he will be out of our lives forever hopefully, or at least kept to a minimum.\n\nTLDR: My husband (soon to be ex) used to habitually rape me.  I took him back after he impregnated me during a moment of weakness and ended up marrying him.  We sort of had a silent agreement that the marriage nullified the rape as long as he never did it again, so I wasn't supposed to bring it up.  But, I did.  One day we were in the middle of one of his abusive tirade and I threw it in his face.  He couldn't believe I said it out loud.  I then went and told his mother everything.  It destroyed any chance of ever having any kind of functional co-parenting relationship and I regret that, but it was bound to happen.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 85562, "stickied": false, "score": 10, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 03:27:56 2017", "ups": 10}, {"body": "I made a snarky comment to someone posting poorly thought out arguments on the internet.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 38064, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 01:47:02 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "9/11", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1892, "stickied": false, "score": -4, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 00:05:18 2017", "ups": -4}, {"body": "This girl was the resident school bully who put on that \"sweet innocent\" act around adults so she was universally beloved despite her cruelties.

The idea was that they would chase enemy ships down, mitigating aiming, and detonate near the vital engine/rudder equipment of enemy ships, incapacitating them. What happened was that the torpedoes often chased each other or the ship/submarine that fired them.\n\n- The USS Barb, a submarine, carried out the only landborne attack on Japanese soil during WWII. Her captain, Eugene  \"Lucky\" Fluckey, identified a railroad near the coast carrying many supplies for Japanese. He and a hand-picked selection of his crew, consisting only of unmarried men who were boy scouts or similar, took one of the Barb's 50 pound scuttling charges, and placed it under the tracks. They put a pressure sensor a quarter inch below the rails. When the train passed over, the rails sagged just enough to trip the sensor, derailing the train. \n\n- The same submarine also carried out the first submarine-borne missile attack in history, ushering a new era of military doctrine dominated by the submarine armed with nuclear missiles.\n\n~~- Picky people will call what is referred to as a \"hashtag\" a \"pound sign\" or something similar. Really picky people will call it its proper name, an octothorpe.~~ Nevermind, \"octothorpe\" is just a name someone made up. The consensus seems to be that it's a \"hash.\"\n\n- If you pick any Wikipedia article, click the first link that not italicized or in parentheses, and repeat that for each subsequent article, you will always end up at the same page. Try it yourself, see if you can figure out which page it is!\n\n- The Japanese battleship Yamato had the largest caliber guns ever mounted on a ship and fired in anger. With a whopping caliber of *18.1 inches*, each shell weighed over a ton (yes, a 2,000 lb ton). Being fired upon by Yamato was like having nine mid size sedans thrown at you at Mach 2. She never got to use them against any significant targets, as she was struck by an air-dropped torpedo from an American plane and subsequently exploded in one of the larger non nuclear man made explosions ever.\n\n- The Germans, however, had the Japanese beat. The design plans for the battleship project H44 called for *20 inch shells*. Shell designs varied from 3500-4000 pounds each (I can't remember the specifics of what design I read about because it's 3 am). The theoretical range was about 50 kilometers. \n\n- American Iowa class battleships had really tricky shell trajectory calculations. At their maximum range, each shell would take about a minute and 30 seconds to reach its target. Additionally, the arcs of each shell were so high, calculations of firing solutions had to take into account the variance in barometric pressure the shells experiences as it travels up to ludicrous heights and then back down again. EDIT: To prove this point, i used [hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/traj.html) to run a quick calculation. [Navweaps](http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.php) says that Iowa class battleships could fire at a maximum of 762 m/s at a maximum elevation of 45^o . Ignoring drag, the maximum height of a shell on this trajectory would be 14.8 km. This means the shell would go from sea level (1 atmosphere of pressure) all the way up to something less than 14.8 km (probably around 13km) where the atmospheric pressure is **.12 atmospheres** and then back down to sea level, back to 1 atmosphere of pressure, all in 109 seconds (which would be more in real life). That's a **88%** change in pressure, which corresponds to an 88% change in drag.

I can't remember if it was ten thousand pounds or ten tons, but it weighed a lot. They used it as an armor piercing bomb against the German battleship Tirpitz. The disadvantage of the bomb was that you had to drop it from a high altitude to give it enough time to speed up enough to acquire enough velocity to do its armor piercing thing. This made it inaccurate. In one bombing raid against Tirpitz, a German destroyer had given Tirpitz a smokescreen, concealing her position. The British bombed anyway, but had no evidence of a hit and called it failure. However, they had gotten a hit. The bomb punched through Tirpitz's armored deck, a few floors, another layer of horizontal armor unique to Tirpitz, a few more floors, and punched through the bottom of the ship into the water below her before finally detonating. The Germans got scared shirtless of the British air force and Tirpitz spent the remainder of her numbered days hiding in fjords. \n\n- Let's imagine you are indestructible.

You set it up on a stand, so the tail of the bomb is pointed at a 45 degree angle and the nose is just around head height. You time the bomb to explode precisely as the supernova reaches Earth.

The idea was that they would chase enemy ships down, mitigating aiming, and detonate near the vital engine/rudder equipment of enemy ships, incapacitating them. What happened was that the torpedoes often chased each other or the ship/submarine that fired them.\n\n- The USS Barb, a submarine, carried out the only landborne attack on Japanese soil during WWII. Her captain, Eugene  \"Lucky\" Fluckey, identified a railroad near the coast carrying many supplies for Japanese. He and a hand-picked selection of his crew, consisting only of unmarried men who were boy scouts or similar, took one of the Barb's 50 pound scuttling charges, and placed it under the tracks. They put a pressure sensor a quarter inch below the rails. When the train passed over, the rails sagged just enough to trip the sensor, derailing the train. \n\n- The same submarine also carried out the first submarine-borne missile attack in history, ushering a new era of military doctrine dominated by the submarine armed with nuclear missiles.\n\n~~- Picky people will call what is referred to as a \"hashtag\" a \"pound sign\" or something similar.

With a whopping caliber of *18.1 inches*, each shell weighed over a ton (yes, a 2,000 lb ton). Being fired upon by Yamato was like having nine mid size sedans thrown at you at Mach 2. She never got to use them against any significant targets, as she was struck by an air-dropped torpedo from an American plane and subsequently exploded in one of the larger non nuclear man made explosions ever.\n\n- The Germans, however, had the Japanese beat. The design plans for the battleship project H44 called for *20 inch shells*. Shell designs varied from 3500-4000 pounds each (I can't remember the specifics of what design I read about because it's 3 am). The theoretical range was about 50 kilometers. \n\n- American Iowa class battleships had really tricky shell trajectory calculations. At their maximum range, each shell would take about a minute and 30 seconds to reach its target. Additionally, the arcs of each shell were so high, calculations of firing solutions had to take into account the variance in barometric pressure the shells experiences as it travels up to ludicrous heights and then back down again. EDIT: To prove this point, i used [hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/traj.html) to run a quick calculation. [Navweaps](http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.php) says that Iowa class battleships could fire at a maximum of 762 m/s at a maximum elevation of 45^o . Ignoring drag, the maximum height of a shell on this trajectory would be 14.8 km. This means the shell would go from sea level (1 atmosphere of pressure) all the way up to something less than 14.8 km (probably around 13km) where the atmospheric pressure is **.12 atmospheres** and then back down to sea level, back to 1 atmosphere of pressure, all in 109 seconds (which would be more in real life).

It's very possible to modify any jet turbine engine to be either (although its use on aircraft may be limited if that's not what it was designed for).\n\nThe MT30 is a turboshaft engine, but isn't designated as one because almost all applications of jet turbines outside of aircraft (and perhaps a few drag cars) are turboshafts.\n\n\n ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2015, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 17:31:58 2017", "ups": 2}], "title": "Turbofan vs Gas Turbine?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72r7hw/turbofan_vs_gas_turbine/", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/72r7hw/turbofan_vs_gas_turbine/", "subreddit": "askscience", "pinned": false, "selftext": "I recently read about the Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines used in ships are based on Trent 800 turbofans with 80% part commonality. \nWhat are the mechanical differences between aircraft turbofans and Gas turbines and if none why the distinction in name from say a Turboshaft.

But he lost his first bid for Governor in the early 1960s because he hedged on the race issue.\n\nWhen he ran in the next election he was determined to not make the same mistake.

Gerasimov took tactics developed by the Soviets, blended them with strategic military thinking about total war, and laid out a new theory of modern warfare\u2014one that looks more like hacking an enemy\u2019s society than attacking it head-on. He wrote: \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness. \u2026 All this is supplemented by military means of a concealed character.\u201d\n\nOr [Vladimir Surkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov), one of Putin's cronies. Putin's actions show a vested interest in destabilizing the current world order and trying to restore Russia to a preeminent position. The annexation of Ukraine is just one more example. More on Surkov, per Peter Pomerantsev's *Nothing Is True and Everything is Possible*:\n\n>In the twenty-first century the techniques of the political technologists [\"the new Russian name for a very old profession: viziers, grey cardinals...\"] have become centralized and systematized, coordinated out of the office of the presidential administration, where Surkov would sit behind a desk on which were phones bearing the names of all the 'independent' party leaders, calling and directing them at any moment, day or night. **The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions.** The Kremlin's idea is to own all forms of political discourse, to not let any independent movements develop outside of its walls.

My sister is a psychiatrist, but the medical community here is so small and the meaning of patient-doctor confidentiality is weak at best, with mental illnesses being a big taboo.

I never had the best relationship with my sister, we were pitted against each other by our parents when we were kids and we never got along when we grew up. \n\nAfter having my daughter who is now 3 years old, I finally managed to both tell my sister. I had been seeing a psychiatrist  over skype secretly for years to be able to manage, both costly and inconvenient. Most antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication are over the counter here. I ran out of my medication and it has been out of stock (terrible commercial agency system here) for about a week and had a bit of a meltdown. My sister immediately got on the phone the minute she woke up to try and find my medication and with the help of her colleagues in a different country managed to get a hold of enough medication to last me another 3 months. \n\nI realized that after keeping my mouth shut and trying to manage alone for so long that I was being stupid and I could have reached out to someone who was supportive right in front me. I was so afraid of judgement and so scared that this in itself led to even more anxiety. The amount of relief that I feel knowing that I can just be myself after so long, and not feel like I'm going crazy all by myself is unbelievable. \n\nIf there is anyone out there who's suffering in silence for whatever reason, tell someone, anyone. You'll be surprised at what people would do for you.\n\nTldr: kept quiet about depression and anxiety for years, ran out of meds, sister/psychiatrist moved hell and high water to be able to help, feel silly about keeping mouth shut and want to tell someone what a relief it is.

We were going to get married and have a life like most young people think. Well, we got pregnant and realized that we were poor white trash and had no resources to raise a kid. Plus, we weren't so happy with each other.\nSo we decided to split up, she'd move back to Texas and we'd adopt her out. Sign the papers, meet the facility, etc. I wanted to be there to help so I was living in my car for a few weeks. Unfortunately, I lost my job (nobody wants a homeless serving them) and had to move back to OKC with my mom.\nA few years later, she shows up with our daughter and tells me here she is, she didn't adopt her out and I'll never see her again. Then she disappeared. I tried every way to find her but I didn't know the person to whom she \"sold\" her existed.\n\nDuring this time (13 more years), I got married, told my wife all about her and she was very supportive. We would try to find leads when we could and even would ask my sister anything but she always said she never kept in contact with the mother. I also walked my sister down the aisle when she got married and she considered me her best friend.\nWell, when my daughter turned 16, she was allowed to know who I was and contacted me because they thought I wouldn't try to get her at that age. I had moved numerous times and didn't have much of an online presence so it was curious how she knew where I was (another state, another phone, etc.). We talked, everything was great and decided that her guardian and she would fly out to California from Texas for a couple of weeks. That was when we knew she was staying.\nMy wife at the time realized, however, that having a pre-teen daughter (still hadn't started her period) and now a troubled teen was too much for her. Her last words to me that day was, \"This is too hard,\" and then walked out. Too hard. So I had to teach my youngest about her period, what happens to a woman's body, etc. Thankfully I had read Judy Bloom as a kid so I knew exactly what to do. ;o) But, really, Are you there God, it's me, Margaret was a helpful book.\n\nI found out that the female parent had \"sold\" her to her great-grandmother for cleaning and taking care of her. It was a trailer in the middle of nowhere in Texas. She wasn't allowed friends, a job, after-school activities, etc. She was not allowed to have doors on her room or close the door when in the bathroom. Her female parent never had anything to do with her.\n\nI found out the reason it was so difficult to find them is that my sister had helped hide her from me. Even when she was claiming to be my best friend and also asked me to walk her down the aisle, she lied to my face every time saying she had no idea where she was. That is how they knew how to contact me.\nI haven't even thought about dating or doing anything with a woman because all my energy has been on ensuring my daughters grow up outside a statistic. And you know what, I'm proud to say that, alone, abandoned by family and friends, chastised by society (I'm old, ugly and fat...I've been told I don't matter) my two girls are phenomenal.\n\nThe youngest has been taking AP classes since last year. She's a Senior this year and already has 10 credits for college, well, she will when done with this semester. Calculus is simple for her and Literature is fun. She's even-keeled and has the most laid back attitude you could imagine.  \n\nMy oldest, the kidnapped one, has been in three motion pictures as an extra. (Ted 2, Battle of the Sexes and LAbyrinth) She's been in acting class for a while now and goes on at least two auditions a month. She's actually pretty good and I would give you links to some of her audition stuff, but I don't know you that well yet. But here's her public IMDB page: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8129111/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm\n\nSo...that's the short story.

Shouldn't you check hcg levels every time, especially when you don't know what the hell is wrong with a patient?!\n\nShe sent me to the ER and I had to have an emergency surgery for ectopic pregnancy attached to my ovary and a partial removal of my right fallopian tube.

I left for about a week then came back and made the decision to stay. It was rough, I'm not going to lie. He really had to go outside of his comfort zone to prove things would be different. He had to talk to my friends and family as well as his own and face head on all the damage he caused. I got all of his passwords and access to his Verizon wireless account so I could see his messages in real time. \n\nI was very angry for a long time. I was prescribed antidepressants. I would fly off the handle so easily and berate him and hold what he did over his head. This went on for about ten months. One day I realized if I was going to stay in this thing, I needed to give it 100%. I either legitimately move past it, or I leave for good. From that day forward, things really improved. I was able to be weaned off of the antidepressants and I'm actually in a really good place now. I love him so much and he's truly a good man.

The fact that you are hot may make it happen more, but being even okay looking will get this sort of attention (and honestly I'm guessing plenty of women who subjectively consider themselves unattractive also get this attention, just less than someone like yourself). \n\nOn top of this, as others have probably mentioned, some men are intimidated by very attractive women and more likely to hit on someone more average looking they think will be \"grateful\" for the attention. Thus the old cliche of guys who are turned down by a girl getting angry and telling her she's \"not that hot anyway.\" Because basically she was a \"good enough\" conquest he thought would be easy and not someone he found super attractive, as he believes a super attractive woman would shoot him down instantly. \n\nThere's also a ton of studies that show the myriad ways people receive \"pretty privilege\" for being attractive - if you were \"ugly\" you would most likely be lamenting how people don't pay attention to you, you have a harder time finding mates, you're always treated as the \"friend\" and never considered as a romantic partner, etc etc cliche cliche.

The less you fit in the box of an acceptable appearance/size the more invisible you become and some people even treat you with open disdain. Mind you, I still considered myself a cute fat girl - I got hit on still and I met my current bf of six years while still overweight. But now that I'm back down to a size 8, it's really driven home how differently people, especially men, treat me now than when I was fat. I also notice how blatantly better they treat me versus a friend if they are overweight or more \"plain\" looking just as I see how quick they are to ignore me if I'm with a friend who is thinner/hotter. \n\nBeing attractive, overall, is a boon in a society that heavily values attractiveness and inherently has many positive biases towards people who are good looking. So to be blunt, don't fool yourself being hot is worse than being ugly/average in our society. It's not.

I'm constantly being mistyped by guys as \"the pretty one\" when I have a slew of mental issues that should come with a fucking warning label. I got really close with a guy who I really loved with a friend, who mistyped me as a \"typical blond sorority girl\" when he first saw me. Our friendship was ruined when he told me he liked me, and I turned him down, and he got really angry about it.\n\nI even tell the totally normal guys who like me, that I'm autistic and bipolar and I have all these issues. They simply don't care, probably because they want to sleep with me. They *should* care. Holy shit, they should! I'm broken, I'm fucked up! And once I turn them down they ghost me! As if we weren't friends in the first place, as if I don't have these problems and need help from a good friend. It's happened a dozen times and it breaks me every single time. \n\nI'm really sorry if I come off as stuck up and narcissistic about my appearance. Can *anyone* relate???  \n\n", "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "over_18": false, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 17:54:19 2017", "id": "72sefj", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 3227, "gilded": 0, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "There has been plenty of research showing that anonymous hiring reduces hiring of women and minorities.

You immediately panic and begin chasing, begging, pleading, harrassing, phoning, e-mailing, IMing, stalking (okay not all of them, just pick whichever one you did). Most of us will likely do some things during this stage that will make you cringe when you think back on it, say after about 3 months.\n\nYou lose weight. You neglect yourself, your house, your job (how many hours do we all log on this site while we are at work?). You drive your friends and family crazy talking about the break up. You cry at the drop of a dime. You can't even comprehend that your life might not again include that \"special person.\" You begin putting them on a pedestal, forgetting all of the nagging things about them that used to drive you crazy. In your mind, they have become omnipotent, all encompasing, all everything.\n\nYou convince yourself that you are a loser who just screwed up a relationship with \"the best person in the world.\" You KNOW without a doubt that you will never EVER love like that again. You know no one else will come along who even comes close to being as marvelous as your ex (excuse me while I chuckle to myself here). You wear a sad face for the world to see (you should see my work ID taken 2 days after my breakup, it's just pitiful).\n\nThey (the ex's) remain steadfast in their denial to get back together. Many of them leapfrog into new relationships, immediately being exclusive with a new person. For those that do leapfrog, they appear to just \"replace\" you with a new model. All of the things you two used to do, they now do with someone else. Bowling, cuddling watching television, motorcycle riding, antiquing. Whatever you two did, likely they will just begin doing those things with someone new.\n\nYou hear about them and their new life. You are desperate for any crumbs of news about their life. Many of us make things worse here by trying to use manipulation to get them back--yet they stay away from us like we are the plague.\n\nFor those of us who do still have contact with our ex's we begin selling ourselves short. Doing stupid things like allowing them access to our bodies and then wanting to strangle them afterward when they remind us that \"Sex does not imply hope.\"\n\nYou, in further panic mode, begin frantically searching the internet using phrases such as \"break ups,\" \"divorce stopper,\" whatever. You stumble upon this site, pay your money because your curious and lo and behold, you find all of us folks in various stages of this whole breakup bullsh*t.\n\nYou voraciously read the posts. You search for news of those who \"got their mates back.\" You're on the site constantly. You'll read the books and think \"Ah I can do this. I can get this person back.\" You begin your \"no contact\" and for some of us, this will get a reaction from our ex's. For the rest, no contact is and will continue to be what you'll get and receive.\n\nTime goes by. You'll do some stupid things. You'll call your ex when you shouldn't. You'll call when you've had to much to drink. You'll call even after 50 people on this site tell you not to. You'll show up on their doorstep, hating yourself all the time. Then you'll come back to this site and ask everyone to tell you why you were so stupid as to do whatever it was you did.\n\nThen you'll get serious about no contact. It'll hurt, but you try to stick to it. Here's the turning point for most. For those folks who have contact with their ex's, your no contact will either bring them sniffing curiously around or they'll be somewhere high fiving their friends thanking the God's that you haven't called.\n\nNow's the tough time. Nothing but time works. Everday the ache in your heart grows a little less. It's only nanobits that it dies down by. But everyday it will get slowly better. You'll have setbacks. You'll run into your ex accidently. You'll run into mutual friends who'll tell you something about your ex that'll have you high-tailing it home for a good cry. You'll see your ex with their new \"friend.\" You'll receive a phone call or an e-mail from your ex who \"doesn't want to be in a relationship but still wants to be friends (with benefits if you allow).\n\nHere's another important part. You need to truly sit down and truthfully look back at the relationship and understand what you did to help with it's demise. If you miss this part, you go through all the suffering for nothing because Buddy, you'll be back here again. This site is to teach you about you. To teach you how to be a better partner, a better person. Missing that lesson is detrimental to the whole process. It's the REASON that you're going through this. God (or whatever your higher power is) needed you to learn something about YOU. Don't miss out on the lesson.\n\nThen one day you'll smile because you didn't immediately check your answering machine when you came in. And one day you'll decide to clean the muck that has accumulated in your house. And one day you'll go outside and admit to the universe that you surrender what control you thought you had.\n\nAnd one day you'll decide to date again. And one day you'll go out on your first date and it will likely be a disaster. And then you'll either force yourself to continue dating or you'll decide that you aren't ready to date but you are ready to be out amongst people again. And many of you will have some quick reconcillations with your ex's. Many of us won't. But one day, it won't matter as much. Because time will allow you to catch yourself going minutes and then hours without thinking of the ex. And you'll begin to be able to think of life possibly without that person and not dissolve into a puddle of nothingness because of the thought.\n\nAnd for most of us, sadly, life will go on without that mate. That's the truth, amigos. Don't want to dash your hopes but probably less than 3% of the people on this site get back with their mates. Sobering isn't it? But, as the site instructs, you must accept this before you can truly begin to heal or draw your ex back to you. For the lucky (maybe unlucky one's depending on how much work it will take to keep a mate that has wandered back) who get back with their ex's, many will find that the paradise they envisioned isn't reality and what they once thought was gold has a certain tarnish to it now. But they stay and try and make it work because it's comfortable or, if they are really lucky, it's meant to be.\n\nBut for most of us. Life goes on. And one day you'll find yourself having a gut busting laugh over something totally stupid and you'll think to yourself \"I am getting better.\" And finally (thank God) you'll have sex with some new and find that a) if it wasn't good, at least you did it or b) it was so much better than with your ex you wonder why you waited so long to get back out there. And you'll know you're one the road to recovery.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to convey here is, while each situation is unique, the characteristics of most of our situations are the same. Most of us will go through at least something that I've written here. So, when someone tells you on this site that time will help you get through it, believe them. When they tell you that \"trust me, it will get better and you will stop hurting eventually,\" believe them. And when they give you good advice that your head understands but your heart rejects, take a moment to think before you react.\n\nDon't beat yourself up if you do something that you wished you hadn't (calling, contacting, etc) WE ALL DID AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. Be kind to yourself. Be forgiving of yourself. And most of all remember that being happily single is an alternative. Even if society is beating it into your head that you MUST have a mate, take some time to heal before going back out there. There are plenty of good people to love, but don't go back out there broken, jaded about love, etc. Accept realty. Experience the pain. Learn the lesson. Actively try to heal. Remember the person you were when you first met your ex and get that person back.\n\nAnd the universe will take care of the rest.\"", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2421, "stickied": false, "score": 12, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 20:31:07 2017", "ups": 12}, {"body": "You have to have your mind busy all time.\nGo to the gym.\nAprende un nuevo idioma para que puedas entender esto!!", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 86, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 22:58:52 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "A month in is not long.

It'll hurt, but you try to stick to it. Here's the turning point for most. For those folks who have contact with their ex's, your no contact will either bring them sniffing curiously around or they'll be somewhere high fiving their friends thanking the God's that you haven't called.\n\nNow's the tough time. Nothing but time works. Everday the ache in your heart grows a little less. It's only nanobits that it dies down by. But everyday it will get slowly better. You'll have setbacks. You'll run into your ex accidently. You'll run into mutual friends who'll tell you something about your ex that'll have you high-tailing it home for a good cry. You'll see your ex with their new \"friend.\" You'll receive a phone call or an e-mail from your ex who \"doesn't want to be in a relationship but still wants to be friends (with benefits if you allow).\n\nHere's another important part. You need to truly sit down and truthfully look back at the relationship and understand what you did to help with it's demise. If you miss this part, you go through all the suffering for nothing because Buddy, you'll be back here again. This site is to teach you about you. To teach you how to be a better partner, a better person. Missing that lesson is detrimental to the whole process. It's the REASON that you're going through this. God (or whatever your higher power is) needed you to learn something about YOU. Don't miss out on the lesson.\n\nThen one day you'll smile because you didn't immediately check your answering machine when you came in. And one day you'll decide to clean the muck that has accumulated in your house. And one day you'll go outside and admit to the universe that you surrender what control you thought you had.\n\nAnd one day you'll decide to date again. And one day you'll go out on your first date and it will likely be a disaster. And then you'll either force yourself to continue dating or you'll decide that you aren't ready to date but you are ready to be out amongst people again. And many of you will have some quick reconcillations with your ex's. Many of us won't. But one day, it won't matter as much. Because time will allow you to catch yourself going minutes and then hours without thinking of the ex. And you'll begin to be able to think of life possibly without that person and not dissolve into a puddle of nothingness because of the thought.\n\nAnd for most of us, sadly, life will go on without that mate. That's the truth, amigos. Don't want to dash your hopes but probably less than 3% of the people on this site get back with their mates. Sobering isn't it? But, as the site instructs, you must accept this before you can truly begin to heal or draw your ex back to you. For the lucky (maybe unlucky one's depending on how much work it will take to keep a mate that has wandered back) who get back with their ex's, many will find that the paradise they envisioned isn't reality and what they once thought was gold has a certain tarnish to it now. But they stay and try and make it work because it's comfortable or, if they are really lucky, it's meant to be.\n\nBut for most of us. Life goes on. And one day you'll find yourself having a gut busting laugh over something totally stupid and you'll think to yourself \"I am getting better.\" And finally (thank God) you'll have sex with some new and find that a) if it wasn't good, at least you did it or b) it was so much better than with your ex you wonder why you waited so long to get back out there. And you'll know you're one the road to recovery.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to convey here is, while each situation is unique, the characteristics of most of our situations are the same. Most of us will go through at least something that I've written here. So, when someone tells you on this site that time will help you get through it, believe them. When they tell you that \"trust me, it will get better and you will stop hurting eventually,\" believe them. And when they give you good advice that your head understands but your heart rejects, take a moment to think before you react.\n\nDon't beat yourself up if you do something that you wished you hadn't (calling, contacting, etc) WE ALL DID AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. Be kind to yourself. Be forgiving of yourself. And most of all remember that being happily single is an alternative. Even if society is beating it into your head that you MUST have a mate, take some time to heal before going back out there. There are plenty of good people to love, but don't go back out there broken, jaded about love, etc. Accept realty. Experience the pain. Learn the lesson. Actively try to heal. Remember the person you were when you first met your ex and get that person back.\n\nAnd the universe will take care of the rest.\"", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2421, "stickied": false, "score": 12, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 20:31:07 2017", "ups": 12}, {"body": "You have to have your mind busy all time.\nGo to the gym.\nAprende un nuevo idioma para que puedas entender esto!!", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 86, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 22:58:52 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "A month in is not long.

There's not one single reason why I haven't been active in the dating scene, there's just been too much life going on in the past few years for me to even consider romance. One of the reasons that has stood out in the long run: I have struggled with body image issues since middle school and I realized I'm certainly not what society considers conventionally attractive. I've been described as androgynous looking in the past, and a stranger once claimed I \"have an interesting face that is almost kind of pretty\". \n\nThis hasn't stopped people from coming onto me, flirting with me, etc. but I can't help but wish I was effortlessly pretty. Even though I've mostly come to terms with my unconventional looks, there's one big insecurity I just can't look past: I'm a fuzzy lady. \n\nEvery part of my body is coated in a layer of hair. It's not as extreme as it could be, but it controls my life. My arms? hairy. My face? Fuzzier than your average woman. My back? It could be used in the bathroom to soak up water from the shower. I have hair on my tummy, my chest, my boobs, my neck, my fingers, my feet, my toes. The list goes on and on. The worst part of this is I can only do so much maintenance. I was cursed with extremely sensitive skin, so most hair removal methods cause me to break out in rashes and acne. I learned this the hard way. A friend even once joked I have \"man arms\". \n\nMost days I wear long sleeves, and I've gotten more comfortable wearing short sleeves, but I've lived in fear of ever wanting to become intimate with anyone because they will see the rest of this Amazon. \n\nWell, this time has arrived sooner than expected. I've been talking to this guy, and it's the age old \"we're just friends\" sorta thing, but we recently both admitted we're kinda into each other. We ended up going to a movie.\n\nHe was kind of joking about kissing me and holding me before we even got to the movie, and it's cheesy high school stuff but it still made me blush. Anyways, we get into the movie and we're buying tickets. I don't look my age so I had to get out my ID.\n\nHe freezes as soon as he sees it and bluntly goes \"Whoa, you look like a dude in your ID. Are you trans?\"\n\nI was horrified. He's someone I've come to trust and his choice of words ruined the rest of the night for me. I remained quiet and stiff even when he tried to get close with me in the theater. I have nothing against trans people and there's no shame in being compared to trans people, however the situation is unique in how offensive it was to me personally, just because of my self perceived body dysmorphia. \n\nAfterwards he just kept telling me how cute he thinks I am, and he really dug the knife in with \"Why do you wear makeup? You don't need it,\" which just really hit hard when he looked at my ID, a picture of me without my makeup, and said I looked like a dude. At the end of the night, I broke down in tears and told him what he said about my ID really hurt, and he apologized and said he regretted saying anything. Humans make mistakes, he's young, and he's not the first person to look at me and think \"androgynous\", I guess it was just a painful reminder.\n\nHe's always telling me how attractive I am, but I have a running fear he might've noticed the hair on my arms and been suspicious. Maybe the ID was an excuse to ask the big question, which he denies. Now I'm feeling unsure about the whole situation, because we're still talking, he still wants to do dumb cute stuff with me, and he's going to end up seeing my \"manly\" arms soon or later, or maybe he already has noticed and doesn't know how to bring it up. \n\nHow do I approach this situation? I'm aware this is most definitely a hormonal thing (I have a thyroid disease) and I'm in the process of getting things sorted out, but what am I supposed to do when I feel untouchable? It's not going to end up just ruining this fling, it's going to follow me into every relationship I get into. I don't want that, and apparently my body hates me and won't let me fix my perceived flaw without covering me in rashes. And I can't change my face, so I end up feeling like I wear my makeup like a mask and as soon as anyone sees me without it, they'll scream.\n\nI don't know how to move forward from here. I'm considering telling him we need to remain just friends, no cuddling or hand holding or couple-y stuff, just because I don't want to face reality.

They will never bring us salvation, because they ask you to abandon independent thought and action. \n\nOnly personal responsibility will yield stable freedom. Blaming God, the devil or demons will keep individuals and groups from learning from their mistakes, from properly adapting to their environments. Children are said to be beyond their years in maturity if they take personal responsibility for their own behavior. Adults who shirk responsibility are said to be like children. Responsibility toward others is the key to adulthood in a harmonious society. Irresponsibly toward others offers corrupt beings an opportunity to become your self-control and the master of your mind. Demons give us this flavor of religion, by corrupting better ones or just making them up from scratch. Jesus' message is opposed to this corruption of mind actually, but Christianity embodies it.\n\nMahatma Gandhi \u2014 'I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians.

Life rewards action. Some people work hard, make money, and their children are going to likely have more advantages than the children of scofflaws, the self-destructive and heroine addicts, people who won't play by the rules, people who likely aren't contributing much. It has always been that way, all around the world, for thousands of years. Here's a tip: Don't expect it to change anytime soon.\n\nPeople who are on the fast track to a highly competitive, highly prestigious service career are going to be perceived as having more to offer than a bar-brawling,19-year-old single mother of a 4 year old child. Now the med student probably had a better lawyer and conducted herself in such a way to be consudered for leniency. You would think that poor people, knowing they can't afford a good lawyer, would try harder to stay out of trouble. But for some reason, this young mom, out in public, was inclined to kick a perfect stranger in the face and break her face.  This is probably going to be dealt with more seriously than a domestic violence case, being a crime at home, and the victim putting themself in the altercation knowing the person well, and the responsibility possibly being more shared. \n\nEvery case is different, and you don't know the whole situation. But it's  certainly not a parallel case. Peraonally, I'd probably rather be stabbed in the leg, than kicked in the face. The med student has a proven record of being productively occupied, probably since her early teens, and that counts in her favor. I'm sorry, that is just the way the world is. Being a parent is not necessarily an equivelent, since so many parents are terrible parents, just milking it for all it's worth.\n\nIn the single mom's case, the victim may have sought a tough sentence for her attacker.  In the med student's case, the victim may not be willing to testify against her, meaning that the state probably wouldn't win a trial by jury, and so they have to make a deal.\n\nIn any case, it's up to the judge to weigh the evidence and decide how harsh of a lesson is needed in this particular offender's case. \n\nI'm not saying either case is fair or not fair, because I don't know, but I have no reason to think the single mom should have been treated more leniently. I'm inclined to think that what's best for the child is not to be raised by a woman who'd kick a stranger in the face in a bar brawl. \n\nRich people, smart people, people well connected with smart, rich, well-connected friends usually get away with more. Is that right? No. Is there anything that can be done about it? Probably not much. But there is no advantage to society to let many more violent offenders off the hook, just because some rich people manage to escape their just punishment. It may seem to those being justly punished that they should be be let off because someone who deserved punishment escaped punishment, but that's not true. Two wrongs don't make a right.
