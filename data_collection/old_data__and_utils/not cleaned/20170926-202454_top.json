You ok?\"  I was like \"Ya I'm fine, what's this for?\"\n\nHe kinda nervously laughs and says \"The thing on the internet, I feel bad about it, want you to know we have your back dude.\"\n\nNow I'm super confused.\n\n\"What thing on the internet?\"\n\nHe stammers \"The... uh.. that picture of you man...

I felt my legs get tingly and just got lost in reading them, everyone I worked with was silent, eventually I said \"Huh...\" and walked back to my desk to cry softly.\n\nI actually went home and at first tried to do the whole \"woe is me\" thing, but then after I really thought about it, I decided they had done me a favor, by forcing me to confront what I actually LOOK LIKE from other peoples perspective, I realized I was only so mad because the truth had been revealed, the Emperor had no clothes on!\n\nI finally realized why I had no real good friends, and why I couldn't get a girlfriend.\n\nI started a diet I also found on Reddit, I lost 160 lbs, and now I'm sitting comfortably at 208-215 lbs, I am happier, healthier, and feeling like I should have done it years ago.  My blood work and doctors are amazed, before the diet I was borderline requiring insulin and was having a LOT of foot health issues.\n\nBut ya, so the subreedit I wish existed is Fatpeoplehate\n\nBecause it forced me to change my life, shaming really does work folks, I'm a testament to that.\n\nhad that not happened, I would probably still be an obese loser and would have never met my beautiful wife who also had a similar journey, we both now work out and do yoga and eat healthy.\n\nFatpeoplehate might have saved my life, but because some cowards have a thin skin, they'd rather cry than change, which shows me that the losers have won and it makes me really sad.\n\nNow downvote me and tell me how I was so oppressed I identified with my oppressors or w/e BS you people believe in...\n\n(Work in IT, all my coworkers live on Reddit, btw if anyone was wondering...)\n\nUpdate - I just got a PM from someone who keeps a burner account in a \"pro fat\" sub, they said my post has been discussed, and they are now coming to downvote me, and that I \"Deserve to die painfully\" for the words of this post.

I was non-threatening and invisible before. Assholish dudes would put themselves above me whereas now they are standoffish. I was less vain, because I didn't give a shit about how I looked. Girls started checking me out, a lot, and that made me uncomfortable at times when i didn't want to be noticed, but also made me want to look nice more and I would get insecure if every girl didn't check me out, whereas before I didn't give a shit. I also developed a distrust for girls because they would act more fake around me and laugh at shit that wasn't funny. Before, if a girl laughed, I knew she meant it. Should note that I was frantically insecure and would pedestal a lot of girls which would cause the behavior mentioned above to stop.\n\nThe urgency of getting laid. Every time I got checked out, I felt like I was missing a possible opportunity to get laid, which would make me feel sad and frustrated, even if I had just gone to the store or something dumb. I didn't give a shit before.\n\nJealousy, dudes had no idea I never got laid because of a bunch of issues (body and intimacy issues from loose skin/stretch marks, social anxiety, insecurity, lack of social skills, particularly in regards to flirting, nervousness over my inexperience, self-sabotage, passing up a lot of obvious opportunities because of these reasons, etc). They would look at me and assume I got a lot of girls and then would be shit to me, or show signs of jealousy. It can be especially frustrating when I'm treated like shit now because I'm a goddamn schizophrenic. But I dress nice, act confident and speak well so they have no idea.\n\nVindictiveness from certain girls. I didn't even compute on their radar before. But afterwards, they would flirt with other dudes to try and make me jealous or revenge fuck someone and make sure I found out.\n\nThe way couples behaved around me. Didn't notice me before. But afterwards, they would get all lovey dovey and touch eachother or kiss when I was around. Fucking bizarre behavior. On the dance floor, couples would come over and dance near me, with the girl bumping or rubbing against me if I didn't show her attention, and then when I looked, they would move away and act all smug, like they won some stupid fucking game I didn't even know I was playing. But I also get this behavior, because I did something similar without realizing it. I went to the beach with a girl when I lived in LA and there was a gorgeous model posing in a bikini. I ignored her but started to get really touchy with the girl I was with. Kissing her, pulling her close and wrapping my unzipped hoodie around her because it was cold. I didn't realize I was doing it because of the model until I thought about it later.\n\nPeople wanting me to be an asshole or wanting to make me feel insecure. Anything that would balance out their insecurity. People do this with a lot of celebrities too. We want them to be assholes, or insecure, or crazy, or a drug-addict because then we can feel better about ourselves in comparison. It balances out the insecurity that someone being better looking induces in people (but I'm sure this would be largely unconscious because it's not something people want to think about). Britney Spears is proof of this. We fucking crucified her.\n\nDudes trying to act dominant with me. This was especially bad in Hollywood (AKA the mecca of narcissism). Dudes would intentionally try to walk into me constantly, as in they would cross the sidewalk to get in my path. I started to feel crazy, but I asked the girl I mentioned above about this and she said that another guy had complained about the same thing. It got to the point where I developed methods of disarming this behavior. Basically just anything to prove I gave less of a fuck than them. I would commit to walking into them if they didn't move, or sing/rap loudly, or start dancing, or feign in the direction I wanted them to move, or just stop moving and stare directly at them until they got out of my way. I even tried baring my teeth at them but that never worked. This has happened in conversation too. I had to develop a sort of asshole side to deal with it when it happens.\n\nI should note that I'm tall, have a fucking gorgeous face, really nice eyes, a good smile and you can't see my body issues when I have a shirt on. This is why I'm subjected to such extreme behavior. Not being narcissistic because I don't think it makes me special or anything. I don't think a lot of people understand how fucked up it can be to be attractive. Not even the attractive people because they've never experienced the other side. I have a deep understanding of it because I know how it feels to be very unattractive (I was 300+ pounds, had long hair and dressed in oversized clothing). Not complaining either because there is obviously a big upside to it, but the other side had perks that most people don't realize. It was much easier to make friends and just generally exist in society. The world seems much more hostile now.\n\nI'll add more to this later. It was like entering the twilight zone psychologically. I've adjusted now and am back to not giving a fuck what anyone thinks and not being as bothered by all the bullshit.\n\nPeople are gonna fucking hate me for writing this, but whatever, it's the truth and I don't care.\n", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 139, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 18:50:51 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "I smoked about \u00a32000 of cannabis in 3 months and lived off pig in blankets and breadrolls, lost 4 stone in the process...\n\nEdit:I misunderstood the title.

I am still cringing at all of the times that I blamed genetics and other bullshit.  Then going online, and seeing the occasional \"fat acceptance\" or \"Health at Every Size\" nonsense out there, and seeing people comment with the same bullshit that I used to peddle myself, and wishing I could just get through to people and make them understand that, no, weight loss is *not* this big, complicated ordeal, it is simple physics that has yet to be debunked, and that no, there is no such thing as \"thin privilege,\" but rather, \"fat consequences.\"  You start to see the fat acceptance movement for what it really is: a bunch of lazy women who yearn, with every morsel of their being, to be marginalized in society.  A bunch of women who claim they are too busy to meal plan, or exercise, as if they don't have the same 24 hours in the day as everyone else.  \n\nI now look down, very heavily, on women who make excuses.  I don't look down on people for being fat, I look down on them if they have those same excuses, that same defeatist attitude towards life.  And a lot of them would have you believe that they are educated, comparing their weight issues to being on par with the struggles of homosexuality, being trans, being non-white, they use terms like fat being \"medicalized\" or \"sizism\" as if every attitude towards being fat is some subject of sociology.  It's all just a roundabout way of saying \"I don't want to go for a walk.\"  \n\n2) When you're fat, you have people trying to sell you things to lose weight.  A lot of information about losing weight is *different*.  Some say you should do this, some say you should do that.  Once you've lost the weight, and once you've adopted a healthy lifestyle, you start to see what's what, what's bullshit and what isn't.  The majority of what's out there is bullshit.  The \"3 foods you should never eat\" is bullshit.  Freelee is bullshit.  Atkins, South Beach Diet, is bullshit.   Dr. Oz, Tracy Anderson, is bullshit.  Weight loss \"secrets\" you hear about all the time, are bullshit. \n Your family members and coworkers who do juice cleanses and temporary diets, always on a quest to \"lose weight,\" are bullshit.  Detoxing is bullshit.  Tess Holliday's \"health\" status, is bullshit. Vegan dieting gurus on the internet, are bullshit.  That friend who claims that she just drank a bunch of smoothies and lost weight, is bullshit.  It's all bullshit.\n\nYou know what isn't bullshit?  Physics.  Calories in, and calories out.  Should you eat lean proteins, good fats and limit simple sugars in your diet?  Yes.  Those should be in conjunction with calories in and calories out - not in place of that.  \n\n3) That just because you lose weight, that doesn't mean you're suddenly going to be comfortable wearing certain things, or that you're going to \"feel\" thin.  The brain does not work like that.  I haven't felt comfortable wearing a pair of shorts or a bathing suit, and I haven't felt comfortable in those things ever in my life.  It's hard, but it's a process.\n\nI always hated my legs.  I have no calves, even though the muscle is there, and I work out, leg *shape* is genetic and unfortunately, I did not luck out in that department.  So for years, I hid my legs.  I do, however, finally feel comfortable in leggings or skinny jeans.

People no longer treat me like I'm invisible. When I was heavier people generally avoided eye contact with me and would always try to avoid sitting next to be on public transit. \n\n2. Going off that when people had no choice but to sit next to me in public transit, I always tried my best to squish and make myself as small as humanly possible as to not inconvenience them with my largeness as much as possible. It took me a while before I got out of the habit of squishing as much of me as I could against the window of a bus or an airplane until I realized I didn't have to do that anymore. \n\n3. Women as a whole are much nicer - girls are much more likely to start up conversations with me and female friends of mine are much more likely to engage in physical contact via hugs, piggyback rides, shoulder taps etc.... \n\n4. Guys on the other hand some of them have been quite a bit colder to me in some instances particularly at bars when there are women involved. I guess when I was heavier they didn't see me as a possible rival for female attention and disregarded me as a nonissue. \n\n5. Eating in public is not humiliating anymore. There is such a sweet, sweet bliss to being able to eat mcdonalds or at a buffet and not constantly telling myself that people are staring and judging my choices and thinking, \"look at that fatso eating mcdonalds - you should try eating a salad sometime \", etc...\n\n6. A wider variety of clothes fit now that I've lost weight. Before I would wear black baggy jeans and black sweatshirts to hide as much of myself as possible (even during the summer). It is so much nicer being able to choose clothes based on current styles and how they look rather than just how much of my body they can hide. I didn't realize how nice and freeing it is to be able to wear a fitted tshirt and shorts and in colors other than black during the summer! Whether its tshirts or jackets or jeans or even baggy sweatshirts, everything looks so much better when your waist tapers down from your shoulders. \n\n7. Jawline. It begins to become a thing and the shape of your face changes giving you the ability to still look good with a wider variety of hairstyles. It still amazes me day after day how different my face looks 60 pounds down, not only do I look more masculine / older,  I look like a completely different person! \n\n8. Um, how do I say this - uhh, your dick gets bigger. Like a noticeable amount without the excess fat around it. \n\n9. People just begin assuming that you always were fit - people are always surprised when they find out that I only recently lost all this weight. They always assume that I've been relatively lean all my life. \n\n10. Being much more okay with being touched. When I was heavier, I tried my best to minimize physical contact whenever possible, not only because I didn't want people to be able to feel how big I was, but also I didn't feel comfortable with people touching me at all. I didn't feel comfortable in the body I was in and people thinking it was okay to poke my belly definitely didn't help. After losing weight, a lot of that went away. I'm still ticklish but now that I'm a lot more comfortable with my body, I am much more comfortable with others touching me although girls hugging my waist from behind definitely took some getting used to. \n\n11. Confidence - everyone should be confident regardless of their size but for me it took losing weight to get it back. There are so many more daily insecurities that you have to face when you are heavier than if you are not whether it is what to wear on a hot day, or even just facing people looking at you and worrying about what they are thinking. \n\n \n\n", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 5884, "stickied": false, "score": 1087, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 18:51:52 2017", "ups": 1087}, {"body": "I lost 60 pounds and look great except for the fupa I still own", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 167339, "stickied": false, "score": 947, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 15:03:20 2017", "ups": 947}, {"body": "I'm a better father.

I got sick of their bullshit. I don't much family so it was a big thing. \n\nThe main reason I cut them off is because of all the bullshit lies they spread about me. They think they're better than everyone so in order to make themselves look good, they have to make others look bad (they are terrible people and live in shit so they have nothing good about them). My wife and I married fast, didn't have a wedding or anything just went to the courthouse. The second they heard I was married (they heard from my dad), they had already made up a story how my wife was a stripper who whored on the side, and I only married her because I knocked her up. My wife was never a stripper (well for me she was), she never whored, and she definitely wasn't pregnant. They told everyone this story, until we made a surprise visit when we were cutting through the state they live in. All of a sudden she never heard that story. \n\nThey are the type of people who will only talk to you if they think they can get something from you for free. For example, when her father was still alive she never talked to him. Until her roof was leaking, then she called him out of the blue, and said she would fly him over 1400 miles if he fixes her roof. They weren't going to pay him, just fly him out there. \n\nAnother thing they do which is geared mainly at me. Their oldest son/my cousin is about a year younger than me. He is a lazy piece of shit, he still to this day (he is almost 30 now) has to be forced to take a shower. If you don't make him he will go weeks without one. He doesn't want to do a damn thing. But they think he is the smartest person on earth. \n\nSo they try to make me look like a terrible person. They would call the college I was going to at the time and tell them I was crazy and had a drinking problem and I was probably drinking behind the school (yea that never happened). When I was still working for a company they would call there saying I cheated on my drug test, or I was selling drugs at work (FYI I have never done drugs in my life), or my personal favorite; that I worked on their car while on the clock (also never happened) and they demanded the car be replaced because I broke it (my dumb ass cousin broke it).\n\nAfter I quit and started working for myself they would spread false advertisement around saying I would steal your shit (they did this because I refused to work on their shit). It was just one thing after another.\n\nWell I got tired of their shit and changed all our numbers, then got a lawyer for $250 just to threaten a lawsuit for slandering our name. They shut the fuck up, after the cried saying \"How could you do this to family\". \n\nThey also piss everyone off with their religious bullshit. They have been Mormon for years but I swear the particular church they go to is a cult. If you're not Mormon, they will try and convert you, if you don't, they treat you like whale shit. \n\nYears later we still haven't talked to them and have no intention to. They don't know where I live (they know the state and that's it), and they know they're not welcome here. Now I have a kid on the way and I am sure they are starting some new lies.

I was having a hard time with the DATs(MCAT version for dentist) and I had just taken it and got a bad score. I came home not feeling so great and my mom asked me how I did. I told her not that well and she looked and me and said, \"See?  I knew you couldn't do it.\"  She forced me to sign up for it again and low and behold I did poorly again. This time I wanted to just avoid any contact with my mom so I made sure to leave the house before she woke up and came home after she went to bed. \n\nDuring this time I had gotten a speeding ticket but I paid it off in secret. What I didn't realize is that a bunch of driving schools will mail you brochures to take their course to get the points off your license.  My mom found out and she called me immediately. What my mom didn't know if that I was in the car with all my friends and I put her on speaker when she started screaming, \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?  JUST DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND BAG GROCERIES. STOP WASTING EVERYBODYS TIME\". \n\nEver since that day I decided to just not talk to my mom.  There's actually a bunch more to the story but fast forward 9 years and I've completed dental school and in my last year of orthodontic residency. I hear from her co workers how often she brags about my accomplishments and how proud she is of me. Some part of me wishes our relationship was better but I always go back to thinking that it was too little too late.

I've posted this before in different contexts. Yes, I know this is long, but you asked for painful, so I will deliver.  I've been told it can be painful to even read. Here's what happened:  \n\nThe day started out so well. I was going to a party with friends after getting my first smart phone. We rode together. It was early April in Minnesota. Though spring had not sprung, we were all too eager to pretend it had as we had been trapped inside all winter. As such, we were having a barbecue outside amidst the retreating banks of dirty snow. The text on my new phone came right after I opened my first beer and fired up the grill.  \n\"Come home immediately\"\nIt was my parents. I quickly thought, what had I done wrong? Nothing came to mind. Well, the night was young and I was on my first beer. My mom often overreacted to things and demanded I come home, I wasn't falling for that one again. The friends I came with would not want to leave so soon, the food had not even gone on yet. My parents could wait. I responded \"I'm out with friends, I'll come home when I can\", then returned to the party.\nWe broke bread and shared beers. We laughed and told tales. As the food was coming off the grill the second text came, its chirp still unfamiliar on my new phone. My parents again.\n\"Come home now. It's a family emergency.\"  \nWorried now, I wondered what it might be. Had someone gotten in an accident? We had a family friend who had been ill, maybe they took a turn for the worse? Or maybe my sister who had been depressed had gotten herself hospitalized again. Well, regardless, my second beer was only half gone and the sun had barely set. As it was still spring that meant the night was yet young, I wouldn't force my friends to leave so soon. I responded that I was gathering people to leave but that it would be a while. I then went around to tell those I came with we'd have to leave a bit earlier than planned but that there was still no rush. As I finished my rounds the food was coming off the grill. I let the problems slip from my mind and focused on the meal instead. I was coming back from the cooler as I got my third beer when this time my new phone squawked, a sound I had not heard before. It was an email, the first I had received. I noticed the sender and start of the subject line. It was my sister's boyfriend, and all it said was \"All my love...\"  \nI felt weak. The world spun and I found myself sitting on the ground half way back to the table with tears silently slipping down my cheeks. While I didn't know with certainty, I had my suspicions. I don't know how long I sat there crying, moments or minutes. It felt like hours. My closest friend eventually saw me there silently sitting in a heap on the ground and asked what was wrong.  \n\"I think... I think my sister is dead...\" I trailed off weakly. The table fell silent. He came over and helped me to the car as the driver who was also at the table gathered the rest who had arrived with us letting them know their ride was leaving.  \n\nThe next 40 minutes were the longest of my life. We drove in silence. I wondered about the details. My parents obviously didn't want to tell me over the phone and I couldn't force myself to call and ask. Was she dead? Did she just hurt herself and get admitted to a hospital? Would there be permanent injury? The thoughts chased themselves around in my head. Then I remembered the email, maybe it had more information. The subject line just said All my love. The body wasn't much more help. \"I'm so sorry\" it said, \"I'll call in a while if that's ok. I'm so sorry.\" No help there, I knew it was serious but little more. We rode in silence as I thought through all the various scenarios, each worse than the last.  \n\nWhen I finally got home I could barely hold myself together. I saw my parents crying in our back room as I rounded the house, some dear family friends already there with them. As I came in I barely managed to get the words out, \"How bad is it...\" I asked unable to summon more words. My mother choked out, \"She's dead. Suicide. We don't know the details yet.\" And that's when it hit full force. It was real. She was dead. Thinking it and knowing were entirely different. I had worried the whole way home about what had happened but now found myself in the worst of those possible worlds. I felt weak. I felt sick. The pain came in waves each more overwhelming than the last. I remember the surreal feeling of looking down at myself, at my family, a disembodied feeling. I was in shock, in the worst pain of my life. But I knew I was in shock. I knew it would only get worse from there.  \n\nThe disembodied self stuck around for the next week as my body played its role in the surreal circus I found myself living. We made funeral arrangements and figured out how to get her body back from New Zealand. Every family friend came to town in a procession, each new face letting me know again that this was real. Each sad expression a tiny echo of the wrenching pain I felt, another reminder of the situation at hand. My other self sat aside and watched it all unfold like some bizarre scene from someone else's life. It wasn't real. It couldn't be real. But it was. So sickeningly real. A whole week I was beside myself. I never knew what that phrase meant until I felt it. I thought they were just words, it was just an expression. My watcher laughed at that thought. It's odd what your dispassionate observer laughs about, but I remember that thought. My watcher didn't come back down to earth until the funeral. There's finality in a funeral. There's purpose to the ritual. It made me realize just how real it all was.  \n\nYears before she had called on my birthday. I had a bad week just before, I had been looking forward to my birthday to cheer me up. But the day came and nearly went without mention. My parents were out of state and my SO at the time forgot. I went to bed at 11 thinking everyone had forgotten. At 11:30 my phone rang. I was in bed and did not get it in time. My sister left a voicemail singing happy birthday, because she'd never forget. There at the funeral I heard her singing 'happy birthday' over and over in my head. It was now sad and slow, a minor tone to the tune. To this day it's the saddest sound I can imagine. Such happiness contrast with such pain. Her remembering when everyone else forgot, then her not being there to remember.  \n\nAs I sat in the pews listening to that haunting melody in my dead sister's voice my other self came crashing down, back to reality. My selves merged and a unified self emerged from the shock I had been in for the past week. The pain hit me again, this time without the anesthesia of shock. It was real. Here was her body and we were putting it in the ground.

I knew it would only get worse from there.  \n\nThe disembodied self stuck around for the next week as my body played its role in the surreal circus I found myself living. We made funeral arrangements and figured out how to get her body back from New Zealand. Every family friend came to town in a procession, each new face letting me know again that this was real. Each sad expression a tiny echo of the wrenching pain I felt, another reminder of the situation at hand. My other self sat aside and watched it all unfold like some bizarre scene from someone else's life. It wasn't real. It couldn't be real. But it was. So sickeningly real. A whole week I was beside myself. I never knew what that phrase meant until I felt it. I thought they were just words, it was just an expression. My watcher laughed at that thought. It's odd what your dispassionate observer laughs about, but I remember that thought. My watcher didn't come back down to earth until the funeral. There's finality in a funeral. There's purpose to the ritual. It made me realize just how real it all was.  \n\nYears before she had called on my birthday. I had a bad week just before, I had been looking forward to my birthday to cheer me up. But the day came and nearly went without mention. My parents were out of state and my SO at the time forgot. I went to bed at 11 thinking everyone had forgotten. At 11:30 my phone rang. I was in bed and did not get it in time. My sister left a voicemail singing happy birthday, because she'd never forget. There at the funeral I heard her singing 'happy birthday' over and over in my head. It was now sad and slow, a minor tone to the tune. To this day it's the saddest sound I can imagine. Such happiness contrast with such pain. Her remembering when everyone else forgot, then her not being there to remember.  \n\nAs I sat in the pews listening to that haunting melody in my dead sister's voice my other self came crashing down, back to reality. My selves merged and a unified self emerged from the shock I had been in for the past week. The pain hit me again, this time without the anesthesia of shock. It was real. Here was her body and we were putting it in the ground.

Ask them questions about how life is really going for them and genuinely listen.\n\n(5) Have sex in one of the ways that they like it but you are less excited about, do it 100% their way, and show how much you are enjoying it.\n\n(6) Offer to take care of an annoying task that they have been putting off.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 501405, "stickied": false, "score": 41, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 19:55:23 2017", "ups": 41}, {"body": "Wake up early for work, but before I go to work I'll go get her some French toast sticks and hash browns from a near by restaurant and come back and wake her up to some breakfast.

(Barnes et al 2005)  There's genomic analysis done that shows that the tissue from an infantile haemangioma is basically identical to placental tissue.  That Barnes et al paper puts it as, \"the view of placenta as \u2018tumor\u2019 and hemangioma as its \u2018metastasis.\u2019\"  There's also an association between transcervical chorionic villus sampling, placenta praevia, premature birth and preeclampsia, which all cause cells to be shed from the placenta.\n\nAnd the other theory is a mutation in an individual endothelial (blood vessel wall) cell, which causes it to replicate rapidly in a clonal (all the same, rather than differentiating to perform different roles) manner - basically a tumour.  Science has no idea why this might originally happen - just the luck of the DNA-mutation lottery, probably - but why's it so prevalent, and why only in babies, and why do they go away?  Possibly associated with higher renin levels during early infancy, which drop as a child gets older.  There are also higher renin levels in the groups in which we see the highest incidence of infantile haemangiomas (female babies, Caucasian babies, and premature babies).

It works pretty well for a bunch of things, but it's very much a crapshoot as to what works and what doesn't.  PlayOnMac is a popular wrapper on top of Wine that makes it relatively easy for a non-developer/non-sysadmin to run a bunch of Windows software.\n\nMono:\n\nWhile in decline at the moment, Mono is a framework with an abstraction layer built in, so that an executable file is runnable on multiple types of systems.  The application must be specifically written to work under mono, and mono must be installed on your system.  While there are a number of cross-platform systems for building applications on top of, Mono is notable here for producing .exe files that run on Linux and Mac as well as Windows.\n\n7z:\n\n7z is an archive manager program that allows you to extract the contents of an archive into individual files.  Notably, it allows you to extract blobs from .exe files.  Most of that information is useless to you, as it consists of machine code, but in certain cases, it can be useful to extract resources from an executable.

In a military funeral, after the flag is taken off the casket of the fallen military member, it is smartly folded 13 times and then presented to the parents, spouse or child of the fallen member by a fellow service member while KNEELING.\n\nThe two decided that kneeling for the flag would symbolize his reverence for those that paid the ultimate sacrifice while still allowing Colin to peacefully protest the injustices he saw.\n\nEmpathy, not zealotry under the guise of patriotism, is the only way meaningful discussion can be had.

These people are not \u201dangry\u201d. These people do not have any reason to be angry. These people are filled with hate. This is the plain and simple reason that they are backing this man and defend everything that he says and does. Seldom can they formulate in words what they are so \u201cangry\u201d about. They are using the word \u201cangry\u201d because it is a legitimate word that denotes thoughtful contemplation and judgment. In reality they hate.  Hate is an emotional response. Seldom does thoughtful contemplation and judgment come before hate. They have an inexplicable amount of hate built up in them  and Trump has arrived on the political scene as someone that is willing to  spew out on the world stage the same hate that they themselves have in their heart. Every time Trump attacks some individual or some group or country, they see it as an opportunity to pile on with their chosen representative of hate They have as little knowledge about circumstances and events as he does. This does not deter them. If the opportunity is offered them to express their hate, they are on board with this man as a legitimized leader. They will defend Trump as a good leader that has done great things but cannot offer even  one example of what he has actually done. They are willing to see him deconstruct everything that Obama accomplished just to see the scorched earth. Just as Trump does, they hated Obama, (mostly because he was a black man) and they do not even stop to think about what they will personally lose from this deconstruction.

They are hate filled and mob driven, and look to Trump as their leader in hate.  Often, I tell them that I refuse to accept that they are angry.

By the following year the casino itself was in debt to the tune of $3 billion, while Trump himself owed some $900 million in personal liabilities.\n\n>In order to keep the Taj Mahal afloat, Trump struck a deal with his lenders in which he gave up half his ownership share and equity in the casino, sold his Trump Shuttle airline and his Trump Princess 220-foot yacht, and agreed to a bank-set limit on his personal spending in exchange for a lower interest rate and additional time to make his loan payments.\n\n>**\\#2 and \\#3) Trump\u2019s Castle and Trump Plaza Casinos (1992):** Less than a year after the Taj Mahal bankruptcy Trump filed for Chapter 11 protection again for two more Atlantic City hotel-casinos, the Trump Plaza and Trump\u2019s Castle, over their inability to make principal and interest payments on bonds. The Plaza ($550 million in debt) and the Castle ($338 million in debt) were competing against each other, as well as against the Taj Mahal, and Trump gave up a 50% share in exchange for more favorable terms on the debts.\n\n>**\\#4) Trump Plaza Hotel (1992):** Donald Trump filed for bankruptcy protection a third time in 1992 over the Trump Plaza Hotel on New York\u2019s famous Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park in midtown Manhattan. Once again, Trump gave up a 49% stake in the property to secure more favorable terms from lenders on the luxury hotel\u2019s debt of more than $550 million.\n\n>**\\#5) Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts (2004):** In 1995, Donald Trump established Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts as a publicly traded company, an entity that eventually consolidated his three Atlantic City casinos (Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Castle, and Trump Plaza), along with other properties, under one company. In 2004, Trump sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the company, with filings listing about $1.8 billion in debt. Yet again, Trump\u2019s ownership in the business was reduced, from 47% to 27%, in order to obtain more favorable terms from lenders.\n\n>**\\#6) Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009):** After its 2004 bankruptcy, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts (TER), and that latter entity went Chapter 11 in 2009 with a debt of $1.2 billion. Trump fought with his board of directors over how to restructure the company and ended up reducing his ownership share of the business once again (to 10%) and resigning as chairman of the board.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 60529, "stickied": false, "score": 156, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 07:52:58 2017", "ups": 156}, {"body": "Florida $125b in debt...\n\nTexas $369b in debt...\n\n[Source](https://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/state_spend_gdp_population)\n\nYea, PR is in debt but come on Donnie Darko, as a person who has a few BKs on his own backyard maybe you should put a little compassion into the position of POTUS for a change!", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 28278, "stickied": false, "score": 130, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 08:19:24 2017", "ups": 130}, {"body": "Come on what the fuck.

Sure the OS wasnt bad, but it also wasn't better then iOS and Android. The app store was limited and they never tried anything to quickly catch up like run android apps or drop the cut for app purchases to 5% or less to entice more developers. \n\nI mean why did they think people would jump ship to their phone? Their UI was different, but in the end it was just another way to do the same thing. What was the thing that you could only do in the windows phone that made it worth the switch and deal with the young ecosystem? The hardware was ok, but they never really did anything special their either except some more powerful cameras a few times. \n\nI don't think it would have been impossible to make a break in to the market but Microsoft would have to take some risks. Integrate the software from hololense into a phone and build an AR smartphone for example. I know they tried many things but they were all relatively safe ventures and none of them made me even consider a windows phone over my android or recommend it over an iphone to less tech savvy friends and relatives. \n\nThey clearly went after the iphone users. The android users come in two camps, those that want the highest end phone with android flexibility and those that just want a cheap smartphone. The latter don't care as long as it surfs the net, makes call, plays music, and does driving directions. They compete on price which the windows phone never did. The former wanted as much power as possible, for status or for capability and the windows phone never put any serious effort to that goal as well. The iphone users just wanted to stay in Apple's very capable walled garden and have the status symbol of the iphone with its very mature ecosystem. The windows phone offer of a less mature ecosystem and less proven walled garden with no real status provided by the phone doesn't exactly scream buy me.\n\nIt was/is a decent smartphone platform, but its not better and wasn't really cheaper either. So the question is, why did they think anyone would choose them? The windows brand may be well known but the system didn't operate like the windows that is well known. Nor did it take advantage of the fact most pcs run windows. There was nothing a windows phone could do with an average pc that an android or iphone couldn't also do. \n\nI don't know what the point of this rambling is, except I am just amazed, when I look back, how a multi billion dollar mega corp like Microsoft can fail that hard at any basic strategy to compete with android and iphone. I mean, did anyone think even for one day that Google's and Apple's dominace in smartphone OS was even a little bit threaten for the lifetime of windows phone?\n\nWhen android was young and just getting started they integrated google maps into all their phones (in a superior way to their iphone maps app) making them valid alternatives to all gps units and did flash on mobile browser very early (now that seems silly now but it was a big deal back then). These, and others, were big risky steps that helped push android to be on par with iphone. That and allowing their OS to be run on a many different devices to let it quickly expand. The iPhone got first mover advantage (its not the first smartphone technically but it's the first one that mattered to the general public so it equals to the same thing in for first mover advantage) and didn't squander it with continual hardware improvements and UI redesigns.

Their goal is to get the FCC (currently lead by former Verizon lawyer Ajit Pai) to gut the current rules, and simultaneously push Congress to pass bad legislation that would permanently undermine net neutrality and allow for paid prioritization and other ISP abuses.\n\n**Obviously most redditors can\u2019t drop everything to come to Washington, DC for a day, but there are lots of ways to get involved, and if we don\u2019t come together to defend net neutrality now, we could lose it forever.

[Attend a local meeting with your lawmaker](https://events.battleforthenet.com)\n3. [Volunteer for \u2018Team Internet\u2019](https://www.battleforthenet.com/jointeaminternet/)\n4. Call, email, and tweet at your lawmakers and tell them to speak out against the FCC\u2019s plan to gut Title II and oppose any legislation that undermines net neutrality.\n\nThe FCC has to answer to Congress, and Congress has to answer to us, their constituents.

We went on a few dates despite our busy schedules and and had really good chemistry but he said that he wasn't even planning in having sex with me that night which was amazing to hear after being told for so long that guys just want to fuck. I ended up drinking just a tiny bit too much for me to drive back to my place immediately though so we walked around the block a bit and ended back at his place. My old boyfriend was obsessed with my vagina, but in a very objectifying way (he loved talking about it, smelling it, touching it in a possessive way, and sticking his dick in it, but he didn't like pleasing me). This new guy, holy shit, he made me cum twice with his tongue and all the while telling me nice things and asking what I liked. I didn't even think I liked oral thanks to my ex. And he was still hard and dripping precum when he was done with oral. He probably would have kept going if I hadn't started sitting up.The sex was good, I'm assuming it will be even better when we know each other better, but the best part is that he kept asking me about how I was doing and what I liked. I had sex at least once a day with my ex, but the goal had always been to make him cum. It was hard even expressing what I liked to the new guy because I've always been so focused in sex on making my ex cum. We tried a lot of positions and it was fun, I think I was too loud because when my ex was getting close, being loud was the only way to make him cum. This new guy stopped to make sure I was okay once when I got to loud haha- I might have to retrain myself a little. In the end when he seemed a little worn out I gave him oral until he came. I could never make my ex cum with oral because of his death grip, but I'm glad I was able to use everything I learned from my ex to give my new guy a really good blow job. It was great how much he enjoyed it and he was complimenting me a bunch too.\n\nGaah I'm not sure this is the right place but I just needed to talk about how amazing it is to have sex that is 'right.'

Because of that, I get to see some of the best doctors in the world. Cool most of the time.\n\nI went to arguably the best diagnostic medical center in the world at the beginning of these troubles. It was a week long trip (the first of many), and of course the only person who could go with me was my mother in law. She did behave that week. This isn't about her.\n\nOne of the doctors I was sent to see was Him. I allowed my MIL to be in the room with me during visits since she had sacrificed an entire week to support me. He walked in the exam room, and he immediately told her that she needed to go to the waiting room because he had to ask personal questions. She left. Doctor knows best, right?\n\nThere was not a nurse in the room. We were alone. The only question he asked me was when my last breast exam had been done. Now, the medical issues I have have absolutely zero to do with my breasts. I was puzzled, but he is supposed to be the best. Surely he sees some relation that I do not. I say I haven't done one on myself recently, but I see my Gyno every year. He then had me take my top and bra off. He had me sit straight up on the exam table like I was when I was having a normal conversation with him. He then proceeded to feel me up for several minutes. For anyone not aware, this is not how breast exams are done. The way he did it, he would not have found lumps or anything. This was not a medical breast exam. He just felt me up. I thought it odd, but he was the best, right? There had to be a related medical reason. I asked him why he thought that my breasts would be related to my odd medical issue. He said that my breasts weren't related, but I needed to be checked regularly. The rest of the exam went on as usual. \n\nOn my way out, I had to talk to his scheduling people for a procedure. While I was waiting, I started discussing it with MIL to see if what happened was out of the ordinary. She said she had never experienced that, and I should ask someone that worked there. I asked the scheduling lady who worked for him about it. She proceeded to scold me for telling lies. \n\nI didn't bring it up again until 3+ years later when I thought of it in passing and realized that I had been sexually assaulted. And I felt so dirty for letting him do that to me. At the time, I didn't know any better, and I blindly trusted a man because I was convinced that he would be able to help me get my life back. \n\nI was forced to see him again. That visit my mother was with me, and I told her that no matter what he said, she was not to leave the room. He didn't even try. In fact, he acted as if he didn't remember me at all. \n\nI wonder how many patients he has done this to in his career.

I'm not really an \"ugly\" girl. It's hard to look at myself objectively: some days I definitely feel ugly and I'm sure there's people out there who would consider me ugly, like with almost anybody, but I don't think that most people do. I get complimented on my looks by strangers pretty often, and I've never had trouble dating. I'm probably like a \"6\" to most people. Maybe cute or pretty, not really hot. \n\nStill, despite being normal looking, I wish constantly that I was prettier and hotter. not because I want attention from people or free stuff or an easier time getting into relationships or anything like that- but honestly, just because I don't want to feel \"weak\" anymore. if that makes any sense. I hate the feeling that being considered \"unattractive\" or not attractive enough, despite the fact that I only have so much control over it, is such a big deal- the first thing people will notice about you, the first thing people will use against you to make fun of you if they feel the need to. Especially as a girl, I feel like there's this unspoken idea that attractiveness and hotness is power. That being hot is the end all, be all of being somebody that matters- somebody that people will admire, respect, listen and pay attention to. And it kind of kills me, because otherwise, I like who I am. I work hard and I think I'm smart and kind, sometimes fun to be around. But I see a picture of myself or look in the mirror and it's like all the beginnings of self worth are dissolved. Who do I even think I am to feel good enough? \n\nAlso- maybe it was just the \"friends\" I had in high school or whatever but I've always been around shallow people. They would do the usual \"hot or not\" thing and judge others' appearances but what really bothered me about the way they talked is that they acted like someone not living up to their standards was a justification to disrespect them, to make fun of them, sometimes even to treat them badly. And I guess being mean like that was no big deal to them, but it really stuck with me. I've since mistrusted others and felt like most people are like that. \n\nAs a kid, I was bullied for my looks and even received mean comments from family and friends, so maybe I'm also still stuck in that mentality of the awkward, embarrassed child. Maybe I'm being much more sensitive than is normal but there's times when I feel like I can't take it anymore how much looks matter and how much I don't measure up. On those days, I hate leaving the house, hate seeing people. I feel totally overwhelmed. \n\nThe thing is, I'm not a shallow person, myself. If I don't find a guy attractive, then I tell myself it's just my opinion and it doesn't reflect on who the person is. If I don't think another girl is \"hot\", then I definitely don't think less of her for it. But when I think about how much it feels like looks matter and look at my own gross reflection in the mirror I feel so worthless. And I don't know how to stop. Has anyone here been through or is going through this? How do you cope?\n\nTL;DR I'm an average girl who feels like looks are everything and people are shallow but I want to feel accepted by them. I don't know where to begin trying to accept myself, and I feel pretty overwhelmed with self loathing. Just wondering if anyone can relate, has been there or has any advice.

She told me pretty early that she had gotten out of an abusive relationship about 3 or 4 months ago and that she had been going to therapy, which she actually finished the day after our first date. She was happy and pretty much over it from what I could tell. From what she told me this dude was a total asshat and at one point almost killed her. I didn't ask about that. Fast forward to yesterday, we went out do grab a few drinks, and about ten minutes before we left she says she has to go to the bathroom and grabs her phone to bring with her, which she normally doesn't do. She was gone for a little while, maybe ten minutes. So we leave go back out to my car and she just grabs me and starts making out with me. This was obviously nice but sort of odd, then she just hugs me and buries her face in my chest for a good minute or two. I pulled her head up to ask if everything was okay and she just starts bawling. She didn't want to tell me anything at first but I persisted and she tells me that this moron has been calling her from a blocked number and threatening to kill himself if she doesn't marry him. Aside from this, he told her that he drove from out of state and was now at her house. She was scared to death to go home. Who the fuck does that shit? No one should be scared to go to their own home. Jesus Christ. So I drove her around the city for a while and we finally went back to her place; he wasn't there. I spent the night, because fuck that guy. She called me about an hour ago because he apparently called her again today threatening the same thing. He keeps mentioning to her that \"they will be together one way or another\". I suggested to her that I call the police on him but she didn't want to resort to that. I have half the mind to confront him and rip his jaw out of his face for scaring her half to death. No one should have to go through this and I'm fucking worried for her. She had to skip class today because she was too upset to go in. She called his mom today so hopefully that puts an end to it, I honestly think its just going to escalate things though. What do I do? I'm so fucking lost. Sorry if this is the wrong thread, I just wanted an opinion from someone who may have gone through a similar situation.

Literally 45% of possible voters either don't care or physically can't vote (voter suppression) in their presidential elections.\n\nAnd that doesn't even begin to cover the problems with Congress. Let's start with the basics: Congress has a ~94% incumbency rate,\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=congress+incumbency+rate&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8\n\nand yet has an approval rating of around 15%\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=congressional+approval+rating&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8\n\nThat's your problem with politics, right fucking there. \n\nMost people don't give a shit to learn how Congress actually works, because Republicans control the vast majority of governor seats, local seats and Congress, even though most peoples' beliefs are moderate/liberal - ***but it just doesn't matter because 1 out of 2 people don't vote***.\n\nFortunately, nonwhites will outnumber whites by 2050, \n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=nonwhites+will+outnumber+whites+by+2050&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8\n\nand voter registrations have been slowly going up, \n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=voter+registrations+comparison+2016&oq=voter+registrations+comparison+2016\n\nhttps://targetsmart.com/news-item/introducing-the-smartshot/\n\n>Looking back at our 2012 VoterBase files, we found 184,960,728 registered voters. As of today, our 2016 VoterBase files say there are 197,780,769 registered voters in our country. So, overall, voter registration rates are up and it\u2019s evident 2016 is seeing more voter registration activity happening. In fact, the 2016 cycle is on pace to seeing 200,000,000 unique registered voters.\n\nas has political awareness among young people. The only thing remaining is to get young people (18-40 year olds, hey, they're young by voter standards) registered and to the polls.\n\nRemember, the life expectancy of current Americans is around 78 for males and 82 for females - and this is projected to actually *go down* due to increased rates of overweight people and obesity.\n\nFurthermore, we can all agree that Trump ran on a platform of racism, ignorance and hate. Well, old people, stereotypically, are grumpy, and set in their ways.\n\nWell, for the future, Hollywood and TV shows are raising kids and teenagers to be more inclusive, more understanding, more researched and overall, better educated about realities.\n\nOh, and the Civil Rights Act was 1966, but once the people that grew up without it have died off, well, that's gonna force politicians to become more inclusive. \n\nAlright, now for the body of your post. If I ***don't*** respond to a particular point, that means that I completely agree with it:\n\n>Sports, politics, and democratic values have been connected for a long long time - and in nearly every case, have later been lauded as defining moments towards justice and equality. \n\n***HOW DARE YOU USE LOGIC AND REASONING! THIS IS AMERICA!*** /s\n\n>Advocating against empathy and justice (as well as the protected right to speech) is, in my opinion, standing on the wrong side of history.\n\nCompletely agree.\n\n\u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d\n\n>He is not a private citizen, but the ultimate public servant.\n\n***YOU RAT BASTARD! HOW DARE YOU ARGUE AGAINST OUR TRUE GOD-EMPEROR!*** /s\n\nAnd everything else looks great. I wouldn't write such a long post without at least 1 expletive by every fourth sentence, but other than that, it looks like something that I'd write. \n\nhttps://31.media.tumblr.com/696cfe79ea149a0b2f4141018eb51378/tumblr_inline_n1581sXTRW1qzcxxq.jpg", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 8532, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 21:46:53 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "It's hard to defend the Constitution when you're busy trying to dismantle it.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 40356, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 03:18:48 2017", "ups": 1}], "contest_mode": false, "stickied": false, "score": 31, "top_comments": [{"body": "\nFollow the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/esist/wiki/rules).

Let's start with the basics: Congress has a ~94% incumbency rate,\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=congress+incumbency+rate&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8\n\nand yet has an approval rating of around 15%\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=congressional+approval+rating&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8\n\nThat's your problem with politics, right fucking there. \n\nMost people don't give a shit to learn how Congress actually works, because Republicans control the vast majority of governor seats, local seats and Congress, even though most peoples' beliefs are moderate/liberal - ***but it just doesn't matter because 1 out of 2 people don't vote***.\n\nFortunately, nonwhites will outnumber whites by 2050, \n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=nonwhites+will+outnumber+whites+by+2050&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8\n\nand voter registrations have been slowly going up, \n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=voter+registrations+comparison+2016&oq=voter+registrations+comparison+2016\n\nhttps://targetsmart.com/news-item/introducing-the-smartshot/\n\n>Looking back at our 2012 VoterBase files, we found 184,960,728 registered voters. As of today, our 2016 VoterBase files say there are 197,780,769 registered voters in our country. So, overall, voter registration rates are up and it\u2019s evident 2016 is seeing more voter registration activity happening. In fact, the 2016 cycle is on pace to seeing 200,000,000 unique registered voters.\n\nas has political awareness among young people. The only thing remaining is to get young people (18-40 year olds, hey, they're young by voter standards) registered and to the polls.\n\nRemember, the life expectancy of current Americans is around 78 for males and 82 for females - and this is projected to actually *go down* due to increased rates of overweight people and obesity.\n\nFurthermore, we can all agree that Trump ran on a platform of racism, ignorance and hate. Well, old people, stereotypically, are grumpy, and set in their ways.\n\nWell, for the future, Hollywood and TV shows are raising kids and teenagers to be more inclusive, more understanding, more researched and overall, better educated about realities.\n\nOh, and the Civil Rights Act was 1966, but once the people that grew up without it have died off, well, that's gonna force politicians to become more inclusive. \n\nAlright, now for the body of your post. If I ***don't*** respond to a particular point, that means that I completely agree with it:\n\n>Sports, politics, and democratic values have been connected for a long long time - and in nearly every case, have later been lauded as defining moments towards justice and equality. \n\n***HOW DARE YOU USE LOGIC AND REASONING! THIS IS AMERICA!*** /s\n\n>Advocating against empathy and justice (as well as the protected right to speech) is, in my opinion, standing on the wrong side of history.\n\nCompletely agree.\n\n\u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d\n\n>He is not a private citizen, but the ultimate public servant.\n\n***YOU RAT BASTARD! HOW DARE YOU ARGUE AGAINST OUR TRUE GOD-EMPEROR!*** /s\n\nAnd everything else looks great. I wouldn't write such a long post without at least 1 expletive by every fourth sentence, but other than that, it looks like something that I'd write. \n\nhttps://31.media.tumblr.com/696cfe79ea149a0b2f4141018eb51378/tumblr_inline_n1581sXTRW1qzcxxq.jpg", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 8532, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 21:46:53 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "It's hard to defend the Constitution when you're busy trying to dismantle it.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 40356, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 03:18:48 2017", "ups": 1}], "title": "The point isn't which side is right, DT or NFL.

The flag is not used in only military contexts.\nIf I think the meaning of something is A, and you think it's B, arguing that my protesting is disrespectful to B is your right, but completely misses or willfully distorts my intention which is focused on A.\n\nI haven't seen any evidence that any player's intention is to show disrespect to the military or service members specifically in any way. If you choose to interpret the protest as such, that is your prerogative - but not necessarily one based in reality.\n\n\n**Is it the \u201ctime and place\u201d for this kind of protest to be launched?**\n\nSports, politics, and democratic values have been connected for a long long time - and in nearly every case, have later been lauded as defining moments towards justice and equality. \n\nSee: Jackie Robinson, Jesse Owens\n\n[Source 1](http://www.npr.org/2017/09/25/553478047/trump-the-nfl-and-the-powder-keg-history-of-race-sports-and-politics), [Source 2](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2017/09/the_nfl_protest_and_the_long_history_of_politics_in_sports.html)\n\n**Is it 'right' for football players, who have arguably benefited from the privilege of living in the US and considering their relative \u201csuccess,\u201d to protest?**\n\nThe socioeconomic status of the people calling for greater justice or less intolerance has absolutely nothing to do with their ability to empathize. What people who argue such are suggesting is that only the actively oppressed can speak out against the oppression - essentially, that only 'the little guy' can speak up for the 'little guy' and everyone else should remain silent or apathetic.\n\nPerhaps Kaepernick and others, in recognizing their own privilege, feel a greater responsibility in acting as the voice to those who do NOT have access to that privilege.\n\nAdvocating against empathy and justice (as well as the protected right to speech) is, in my opinion, standing on the wrong side of history.\n\n**What is Colin Kaepernick\u2019s intention?**\n\nColin Kaepernick, last year: \"\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. \"To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\"\n\nEric Reid, teammate in the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/opinion/colin-kaepernick-football-protests.html?mcubz=1): \"We spoke at length about many of the issues that face our community, including systemic oppression against people of color, police brutality and the criminal justice system. We also discussed how we could use our platform, provided to us by being professional athletes in the NFL, to speak for those who are voiceless. \n\n\"After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, the next day during the anthem as a peaceful protest. We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture. I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.\" \n\n**Does the President have the right to freedom of speech?**\n\nYes. But the president is not just a representative of the government, but the *main* face of the country domestically and internationally. He is not a private citizen, but the ultimate public servant.\n\n**What is the President\u2019s primary role?**\n\n> \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nI will ask you to consider - do you believe that while the President is not doing anything strictly illegal by the terms of the First Amendment, which is specific to Congress - do you believe he is reflecting the *spirit* of American values. Is he obeying his primary duty - which is to ***uphold the Constitution*** when he speaks out against peaceful protest??\n\n**How much of this is about racial injustice and how much of this is about the President?**\n\nWhile many *also* feel that bringing attention to the cause of rectifying racial injustice is an important one - this issue came to a head *specifically because the President is leading a boycott against an organization for practicing its Constitutional rights.*\n\nFinally, consider Charlottesville. Let\u2019s compare what the NFL players are doing with what the Neo-Nazis are doing. Then, consider the reactions and statements by the President in each situation, of NFL PLAYERS vs. NEO-NAZIS\n\n(EDIT: Not sure how to format this into a table)\n\n**Type of Protest**\n\n*  Silent, Non-violent kneeling during the National Anthem | \n* Hate Speech ('Jews will not replace us!') during a march with torches, menacing a synagogue, and running over and killing a counter-protestor\n\n**Goal of Protest**\n\n* Bring attention to and fight against perceived racial injustice by the institutions the flag represents | \n* Honoring the legacy of a rebel army that **went to war** directly *against* the institution the flag represents\n\n**Protected by Freedom of Speech**\n\n* Yes\n* Unclear, but some forms likely are\n\n**President's Reaction - (Including Affirmation of Freedom of Speech)**\n\n* Days of tweets, statements, and speeches that include expletives and calls for boycotts, with little to no affirmation of the players protected Constitutional rights\n* Equivocation ('many sides'), defense of Confederate monuments as \"trying to take away our culture.\"\n", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "over_18": false, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 18:27:53 2017", "id": "72kp5g", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 499040, "gilded": 0, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "\nFollow the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/esist/wiki/rules).

The decision highlights the damage that the no-driving policy has done to the kingdom\u2019s international reputation and its hopes for a public relations benefit from the reform.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, is a Muslim monarchy ruled according to Shariah law. Saudi officials and clerics have provided numerous explanations for the ban over the years.\n\nSome said that it was inappropriate in Saudi culture for women to drive, or that male drivers would not know how to handle women in cars next to them. Others argued that allowing women to drive would lead to promiscuity and the collapse of the Saudi family. One cleric claimed \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that driving harmed women\u2019s ovaries.\n\nRights groups have long campaigned for the ban to be overturned, and some women have been arrested and jailed for defying the prohibition and taking the wheel.\n\nBut the momentum to change the policy has picked up in recent years with the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a 32-year-old son of the king who has laid out a far-reaching plan to overhaul the kingdom\u2019s economy and society.\n\nBeyond the effects it could have on Saudi Arabia\u2019s image abroad, letting women drive could help the Saudi economy.\n\nLow oil prices have limited the government jobs that many Saudis have long relied on, and the kingdom is trying to push more citizens, including women, into gainful employment. But some working Saudi women say hiring private drivers to get them to and from work eats up much of their pay, diminishing the incentive to work.\n\nIn recent years, many women have come to rely on ride-sharing apps like Uber and Careem to gain some freedom of movement.\n\nDespite the announcement, women will not be able to drive immediately. The kingdom has no infrastructure for women to learn to drive or to obtain drivers licenses. The police will need to be trained to interact with women in a way that they rarely do in a society where men and women who are not related rarely interact.\n\nBut many of the kingdom\u2019s professionals and young people will welcome the change, viewing it as a step to making life in the country a bit more like life elsewhere.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 42186, "stickied": false, "score": 1269, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 23:04:27 2017", "ups": 1269}, {"body": "Well I better go renew my driving license before the long lines begin", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1217, "stickied": false, "score": 1232, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 23:08:44 2017", "ups": 1232}], "title": "Saudi Arabia: King Salman orders driving licenses for women", "url": "https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2017/09/26/Saudi-Arabia-King-Salman-orders-driving-licenses-for-women.html", "num_comments": 4081, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/72mkka/saudi_arabia_king_salman_orders_driving_licenses/", "subreddit": "worldnews", "pinned": false, "selftext": "", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "over_18": false, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 22:58:48 2017", "id": "72mkka", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 1564211, "gilded": 1, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Humans are a disease.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1835, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 16:12:10 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "We're a cancer that needs treating.
