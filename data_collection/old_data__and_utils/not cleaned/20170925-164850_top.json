Not the end of the world, I'll even vouch that this gossipy kid is still a great kid, it's just young girls you know.\n\nAnyway, my daughter doesn't respond so well to \"betrayal\". I started hearing that she had turned some other kids against the gossipy girl, which was giving gossipy girl a hard time socially. I wasn't sure whether to believe it, I mean my kid is an angel right?\n\nThen we found it. My 11 yo angel had, in a notebook next to her bed, a complete and detailed business plan about how to destroy this \"traitor's\" life. What to say, and to whom, and when, and who could be enlisted and enlist others to cut this gossipy girl out of various social circles. She had this plan, she was executing it, and it was working.\n\nOoooh shit. We had some talking to do. Luckily, she had a bully the year before, so she was able to remember what that feels like and decide maybe it didn't feel good to do that to somebody else, even if they were a little snooty gossip. My daughter turned it around, and engineered the social recovery of her detested enemy.

What we surmise is that preterm birth is a complex problem that seems to have both a strong genetic component (e.g. it appears heritable) and an environmental component (e.g. preterm rates vary between countries). \n\nThe genetics of parturition is especially complicated because even in the same mother, every pregnancy involves a novel combination of genes. While the mother's genome (her DNA) remains a constant, the fetus' genome is a 50-50 mix of genes from mom and dad. This is vital point because both the fetus and the mom make a very important organ called the [placenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta).  Because the fetal component of the placenta will contain different sets of genes from pregnancy to pregnancy, and because the genetics of preterm birth are often only focuses on the mother's genotype, it's likely that we are missing a very large fraction of genetic picture.\n\nLikewise, the environmental component is tricky because of multiple confounders, many of them unknown.  For example, here is the [WHO's list](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/) of countries with the highest ~~rates~~ numbers of preterm birth. \n\n* India: 3 519 100\n* China: 1 172 300\n* Nigeria: 773 600\n* Pakistan: 748 100\n* Indonesia: 675 700\n* The United States of America: 517 400\n* Bangladesh: 424 100\n* The Philippines: 348 900\n* The Democratic Republic of the Congo: 341 400\n* Brazil: 279 300\n\nNotice that he USA us right in there.  Surprised? In fact, the US has the highest pre-term rate of any industrialized country and no one has a good answer as to why. Some of the biggest predictors seem to be both the prevalence of C-sections in the US and the reduction of inter-pregnancy intervals; both of these independently increase the risk of a preterm birth, and they often occur together in the US.

So excuse the lack of formatting and grammar and possible autocorrect sabotage. \n\nThere isn't a prefect, defined signal.  There are a lot of things happening at the end of gestation that can cause a baby to come early or late or on time. One of these is the growth and development of the fetus and when things are developed and it's just growing. If i rememeber correctly this is around 37 or 38 weeks. \n\nAnother is the placenta, where the nutrients are exchanged between mom and fetus. Around 42 weeks the placenta will start to decline in function because it's done it's job and isn't programmed to last much longer. This is one reason they don't want people to go past 42 weeks. \n\nMother's health and any chronic conditions also play into it. If she has been having high blood pressure or gestational diabetes that can change when things \"go\" or how big the fetus gets at certain points in time. This can cause her to carry longer or shorter depending on how her body handles things \n\nThere is also moms body being triggered to go into labor when the fetus settles into the pelvis and pushes on the cervix, along with stretching of the lower uterus, etc. Fetus knows when it's ready the majority of the time (Not a conscious \"let's do this\" but more of a hormone and cell signal type thing) and starts to move into position. \n\nIt's really a concert of hormones and receptors and signals that all work together to determine the right time.  Sometimes those things trigger at the wrong time, or something happens to mom and that triggers it (trauma, drugs, disease, poor cervical tone, etc). Sometimes it's the anatomy of mom and her cervix can't hold shut well enough so when there's too much it decides it's labor time, or often this can cause miscarriages earlier in the pregnancy. There are a variety of other things that can cause those as well. \n\nAnd of course, emergencies can cause mom to need to go into labor or have a c-section earlier than they want because of risk of death to either mom or fetus. I know someone who had a baby at 28 weeks because her blood pressure was dangerously high and she was going blind (preeclampsia).

This is vital point because both the fetus and the mom make a very important organ called the [placenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta).  Because the fetal component of the placenta will contain different sets of genes from pregnancy to pregnancy, and because the genetics of preterm birth are often only focuses on the mother's genotype, it's likely that we are missing a very large fraction of genetic picture.\n\nLikewise, the environmental component is tricky because of multiple confounders, many of them unknown.  For example, here is the [WHO's list](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/) of countries with the highest ~~rates~~ numbers of preterm birth. \n\n* India: 3 519 100\n* China: 1 172 300\n* Nigeria: 773 600\n* Pakistan: 748 100\n* Indonesia: 675 700\n* The United States of America: 517 400\n* Bangladesh: 424 100\n* The Philippines: 348 900\n* The Democratic Republic of the Congo: 341 400\n* Brazil: 279 300\n\nNotice that he USA us right in there.  Surprised? In fact, the US has the highest pre-term rate of any industrialized country and no one has a good answer as to why. Some of the biggest predictors seem to be both the prevalence of C-sections in the US and the reduction of inter-pregnancy intervals; both of these independently increase the risk of a preterm birth, and they often occur together in the US. So the implication is that among environmental factors, even our reproductive medicine can interfere long-term with the natural mechanisms of parturition.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 22413, "stickied": false, "score": 71, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 16:49:33 2017", "ups": 71}, {"body": "Preface: nursing student that took OB about 8 months ago on a cell phone. So excuse the lack of formatting and grammar and possible autocorrect sabotage. \n\nThere isn't a prefect, defined signal.  There are a lot of things happening at the end of gestation that can cause a baby to come early or late or on time. One of these is the growth and development of the fetus and when things are developed and it's just growing. If i rememeber correctly this is around 37 or 38 weeks. \n\nAnother is the placenta, where the nutrients are exchanged between mom and fetus. Around 42 weeks the placenta will start to decline in function because it's done it's job and isn't programmed to last much longer. This is one reason they don't want people to go past 42 weeks. \n\nMother's health and any chronic conditions also play into it. If she has been having high blood pressure or gestational diabetes that can change when things \"go\" or how big the fetus gets at certain points in time. This can cause her to carry longer or shorter depending on how her body handles things \n\nThere is also moms body being triggered to go into labor when the fetus settles into the pelvis and pushes on the cervix, along with stretching of the lower uterus, etc. Fetus knows when it's ready the majority of the time (Not a conscious \"let's do this\" but more of a hormone and cell signal type thing) and starts to move into position. \n\nIt's really a concert of hormones and receptors and signals that all work together to determine the right time.  Sometimes those things trigger at the wrong time, or something happens to mom and that triggers it (trauma, drugs, disease, poor cervical tone, etc). Sometimes it's the anatomy of mom and her cervix can't hold shut well enough so when there's too much it decides it's labor time, or often this can cause miscarriages earlier in the pregnancy. There are a variety of other things that can cause those as well. \n\nAnd of course, emergencies can cause mom to need to go into labor or have a c-section earlier than they want because of risk of death to either mom or fetus. I know someone who had a baby at 28 weeks because her blood pressure was dangerously high and she was going blind (preeclampsia). Both of them are great now, but he had to spend a few weeks in the NICU since he was so small. \n\nI hope that helps. There's so many thing but I tried to cover some of the big ones we learned about.

Main Voice Coil motor.  This is the main way to move the head, and every drive must calibrate itself to know exactly how much current will cause how much force onto the system.  As the system knows its own inertia this allows you to calculate how much this will move the head, and how fast.\n\n2.  Secondary Actuator.  Many high performance hard drives have a secondary actuator on the very end of the servo arm.  This secondary actuator uses a Peizo Electric material to move the read/write head at an incredible precision and very high frequency. However the range is very small (micro inches)\n\n3.  Z-axis servo.  There is also control of the head height above the disc.  This is on the order of angstroms to nano-meters.  Is is also controlled via a mixture of hardware design (the wing that flys above the disc) and firmware control (distorting the head to move the head up and down)\n\nFor a more indepth review of hardware you can take a look at [Dual Stage Servo Control](http://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/product/storage/pdf/ToshibaReview_vol66n11.pdf)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 6011, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Tue Sep 26 00:10:31 2017", "ups": 1}], "title": "In a magnetic hard disk, how are the servos that position the read/write head so accurate?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72aax0/in_a_magnetic_hard_disk_how_are_the_servos_that/", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/72aax0/in_a_magnetic_hard_disk_how_are_the_servos_that/", "subreddit": "askscience", "pinned": false, "selftext": "With the data tracks as narrow as they are (on the order of a hundred nanometers or so wide), these servos must be incredibly precise.

Watt is the power/energy equivalent of speed, whereas kilowatthour is the equivalent of distance. You're charged per kWh just like you would be charged based on distance, not speed, by a transportation agency.\n\n*Full:* The story starts with the unit Joule (J). This unit expresses an amount of energy. A rather small amount, that is. In many cases, it is useful to not only consider the total amount of energy used, but also the rate at which energy is used as a function of time. So you might consider looking at Joule-per-second (J/s). A device that uses 20 J/s will use a total of 1000 J if used for 50 seconds. This is similar to how speed, time and distance interact: An object traveling at 20 meters per second for 50 seconds will travel 1000 meters.\n\nSince J/s is used so often, a shorthand unit was introduced for it: The Watt (W). 1 W is simply 1 J/s. When we have a device and want to express its power consumption, we do so using Watt. A lightbulb might use 60 W, a microwave oven 1,000 W. This tells us nothing about the total amount of energy used unless we also know how long the device is in use. 60 seconds of microwaving with the previously mentioned oven will use up 60,000 J of energy. It takes 1,000 seconds of having this 60 W lightbulb on to get the same amount of energy consumption.\n\nSince many devices are run for considerably longer than seconds, numbers tend to get rather big and clumsy to work with. Which is why people started using the unit \"Watt-hour\" (Wh), which is a multiplication of the power consumption in Watt and the running time in hours. The outcome is another measure of energy (similar to how you can measure speed both in meters per second and meters per hour, two different ways of measuring the same thing). 1 Wh is the amount of energy used by a 1 W device running for 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 3,600 seconds, this means that 1 Wh is equal to 3,600 J.\n\nSince numbers still get big rather quickly, because many devices use tens or hundreds of Watt, the \"kilo-\" (k) prefix is commonly used to denote multiples of 1,000. So 1 kWh stands for the energy consumption of a 1 kW device operating for 1 hour. Or a 1 W device running for 1000 hours. It's equal to 3,600,000 J.\n\nkWh has become the common way to measure energy consumption of households and businesses, because it offers enough precision without having to go way beyond the decimal point, yet still yields numbers that are small enough to easily grasp and work with.\n\nBy now, I hope it's obvious why you're charged by the kWh and not by the kW.

The outcome is another measure of energy (similar to how you can measure speed both in meters per second and meters per hour, two different ways of measuring the same thing). 1 Wh is the amount of energy used by a 1 W device running for 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 3,600 seconds, this means that 1 Wh is equal to 3,600 J.\n\nSince numbers still get big rather quickly, because many devices use tens or hundreds of Watt, the \"kilo-\" (k) prefix is commonly used to denote multiples of 1,000. So 1 kWh stands for the energy consumption of a 1 kW device operating for 1 hour. Or a 1 W device running for 1000 hours. It's equal to 3,600,000 J.\n\nkWh has become the common way to measure energy consumption of households and businesses, because it offers enough precision without having to go way beyond the decimal point, yet still yields numbers that are small enough to easily grasp and work with.\n\nBy now, I hope it's obvious why you're charged by the kWh and not by the kW. The amount of kW used is fairly meaningless, because it changes constantly as you use different devices. It is a measure of how quickly you consume energy. And you're charged based on how much you consume in total.\n", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 143143, "stickied": false, "score": 6, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 12:09:20 2017", "ups": 6}, {"body": "They are measuring different things: a kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy, whereas a kilowatt is a unit of power (ie. the rate at which you are using energy at a given time).\n\nThat said, the standard SI unit of energy is the Joule, which would correspond to a watt-second. Since a kilowatt-hour refers to using 1000 times as much power for 3600 times as long, it follows that it is 3600000 times larger - in other words, 1kWh = 3.6MJ.\n\nI can't comment as to why the kWh was adopted historically, however it does have the benefit of being easy to explain to customers (running a one-bar electric fire - which typically uses 1kW - for an hour will consume 1 kWh  of electricity).\n\nThis does become slightly absurd when power companies talk about generating a number of GWh or TWh per year, since that is back to being a measure of power (so could have been expressed directly as a number of kW or MW).\n", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 438, "stickied": false, "score": 2, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 12:20:41 2017", "ups": 2}, {"body": "So a kilowatt is a unit of power, or the amount of energy used over a specific amount of time (the SI expression for kW is 1 kJ/s).

Police shootings and racial inequality are already huge topics in American media and culture, and this protest seems to be only generating discussion about players right to protest and whether this protest is anti-American, not about the problems they are protesting. In this way it is something of a distraction, at least in the short term, that could be avoided completely by choosing another avenue of protest.\n\n===\n\n\n\nProtesting American problems by skipping out on the national anthem signals a kind of withdrawal from American identity, and in so doing reduces America to it's problems and protests America. The problem is that America obviously does not consist only of problems. That's why protesting in this way is anti-American-- it's protesting American problems by protesting America, rather than the better method of ensuring the protest is against the actual problems. Because of this, it is divisive. Why not a method of protest that helps bring people together around common aspirations and values?

So why should she and other young people place trust in systems that can perennially fail us?\n\n> I wish I had told her that the way out of this conundrum is to make these institutions her own. I wish I had told her that these institutions are worth respecting and preserving for their (albeit imperfect) embodiment of Enlightenment values; that she surely should want to embrace those values; and that her generation could make those values more true, not less.\n\n\n===\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 31565, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 19:42:03 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Who is saying it's not their right?

The fact Zukerberg thought he could hide it or didn't know about it shows how not bright the guy really is. He even had my post comparing him to a Nazi sympathizer deleted, which I posted again. Ok, maybe it was not him personally, or MAYBE IT WAS! The point is, don't trust Mark Zukerberg! He is a data mining, add selling dork that will probably never do anything beside create Facebook, which I think actually has no real value and never did. It's right up there with Uber for bullshit ideas that get overvalued. Like OMG I made and app for taxi drivers and outsources tax driving, SO AMAZING! It's just outsourcing and the obvious extension of mobile computing to taxis. That's like saying The Weather Channel making an app should be some multi billion dollar idea. Like OMG people didn't realize apps speed of existing processes. I thought they were just for chopping fruit and shooting birds at pigs!\n\nThat's the problem with a lot of the tech billionaires, most of them just got lucky and branded a good idea. Now they appear like some kind of business leaders/geniuses, but most of them, by far, are really just one hit wondering riding off insanely bloating stock values.\n\nFacebook, to me, is more than worthless. It's a net loss of communication, professionalism and privacy. I would never use the platform other than to perhaps follow some band I liked and that's simply because I know most working musicians or even small businesses aren't organized enough to run their own websites.\n\nHowever, they really should just get off facebook and embrace the concept of having their own privately hosted, professional and flexible website. \n\nI personally don't trust any business that primarily operated from Facebook and I certainly don't trust the reviews of services and products on Facebook because the circles of interest are inherently stocked with friends and bias. \n\nA truly open and public forum is always going to be better for communication and business than a place where you can be every selective and censor easily. Facebook essentially helps people form biases even faster than normal human behavior by hiding them away from mainstream views if they want. \n\nNewspapers and town hall meetings don't give people such protections from the general public and let their false beliefs fester as easily. \n\nThe old ways were better in this case. Dividing people into more and more groups as well as simplifying communication like you clearly see on twitter or in SMS, is simply not good for the quality of communication.\n\nYou can't express complex ideas very well on social media because people want everything to be condenses into a couple lines or pictures with few words. It's a horrible place for communication and ideas. \n\nIt gives people the flashy appearance of being a professional service with an integrated and flexible multimedia presentation, but really it's just a blog with built in email and some lame apps that all data mine you for profit and sell you targeted adds.\n\nIt's a data mining AND add delivery platform in one. All the others services are just there to sucker you into using it to expose yourself to their adds and data mining. \n\nI don't understand why so many people like it. I've hated the idea of real name social networking from day one. Myspace was ultimately FAR better than Facebook and a bunch of school kids flocked to the kewl new thing and BOOM now baby boomers think they will be hip and maybe reverse age 20 years if they get on Facebook. \n\nNOPE, sitting around being retired still generally makes you worthless and dumb as a box of rocks over time. That's what happens to humans once they have no responsibilities, they just become troublemakers and idiots. \n\nThat's why it's going to remain better to create jobs than to dole out income as people cannot find work due to automation.

Police shootings and racial inequality are already huge topics in American media and culture, and this protest seems to be only generating discussion about players right to protest and whether this protest is anti-American, not about the problems they are protesting. In this way it is something of a distraction, at least in the short term, that could be avoided completely by choosing another avenue of protest.\n\n===\n\n\n\nProtesting American problems by skipping out on the national anthem signals a kind of withdrawal from American identity, and in so doing reduces America to it's problems and protests America. The problem is that America obviously does not consist only of problems. Protest, though generally an American value by virtue of the fact that America values freedom of speech, cannot in this case be considered \"American\" because it is being applied to the American idea. It is similar to \"tolerance of intolerance is not tolerance\". Protest means to go against and try to stop something because you disagree with it. Protesting America, i.e. going against the American idea... is anti-American.\n\nThe whole point is that there's a difference between protesting the *problems* in America (which should be done), and protesting **America** itself. That's why protesting in this way is anti-American-- it's protesting American problems by protesting America, rather than the better method of ensuring the protest is against the actual problems. Because of this, it is divisive. Why not a method of protest that helps bring people together around common aspirations and values? And better yet, one that is solution oriented rather than simply pointing to a problem?\n\n\n\n\nThis latter point reminds me of this [op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/education/teaching-inclusion-in-a-divided-world.html?_r=1) with a professor in the NYT:\n\n> One of the most difficult intellectual and emotional challenges I faced earlier this year at Yale was finding an answer to a Native American student\u2019s poignant question: Why should she put any faith in institutions in our society \u2014 including our judicial system and universities \u2013 when those institutions had clearly betrayed her people in generations past?\n\n> \u201cThe same Constitution with its protection of the rights to free expression and assembly that you revere,\u201d she said, \u201cwas previously of no use to people like me.\u201d\n\n> She was right, of course. So why should she and other young people place trust in systems that can perennially fail us?\n\n> I wish I had told her that the way out of this conundrum is to make these institutions her own. I wish I had told her that these institutions are worth respecting and preserving for their (albeit imperfect) embodiment of Enlightenment values; that she surely should want to embrace those values; and that her generation could make those values more true, not less.\n\n\n===\n", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 31565, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 20:01:10 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "once soldiers speak out it always end up turning into a pissing contest  of who served more, What branch you served it, etc etc.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 27407, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 23:05:52 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": ">[Some] soldiers [hand picked by the editors and reporters for their more liberal views on protest] speak out on kaeperkick...\n\nFTFY\n\nUnfortunately, articles like this are a distortion of the truth, which is that most of the military is fairly conservative and are not behind Kaepernick.

You could put off reporting for conscription so long as you were in college making decent progress toward a degree. Who in their right mind would not choose college over going to war as a buck private? You still had to report to your draft board and if you quit, flunked out or got kicked out that was it for you - into the army you go. Hundreds of thousands of kids got student deferments. They were not draft dodgers in any sense of the word. By 1968 there was widespread understanding that the war was wrong, badly mismanaged and unwinnable. By 1970 a majority of the American people were squarely against it.\n\nSecond, medical disqualification resulted in a 1-Y draft classification, which is what people often refer to as \"4-F.\" In reality there is no such classification as 4-F. 1-Y ineligibility was based on medical evidence and the decision was made by military doctors. My own was based on a serious adolescent injury that never did fully heal. The 1-Y decision was issued by the military after multiple x-rays at the draft center, a lot of poking and prodding from two captains who were doctors and then a review of the entire medical chart while I was interviewed by a colonel who was also a doctor. They didn't hand them out lightly and they didn't hand them out just because you complained that you're a little sore. Maybe Trump got some doc to fake a medical record for him, but in my experience both him and it would have to have been examined by military doctors before any 1-Y classification would be issued. And it appears that they gave him only a temporary one. Otherwise he would not have ever had to get student deferments.\n\nMy reason for writing is to correct the author of the article and make the point that as opponents of Trump our position is weakened when we rely on reasons that are mistaken on the facts. When we do that it gets easy for Trump and his goons to say, \"Look at that. They don't even know what they're talking about.\" I hate when they do that, especially when they're correct.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 1093, "stickied": false, "score": -16, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 11:35:20 2017", "ups": -16}, {"body": "He dodged the draft on 1 count em 1 MEDICAL Deferment for bone spurs, which frankly at his age and weight its dubious.

Of course, some windows-specific things are still closed source, like WPF, afaik.\n - The Linux Subsystem for Windows is purely for developers, it can't support GUI code at all AFAIK.\n - They have pushed .net to cross-platform with .net core and .net standard. \n\nAll of these help boost developer interest in .NET.

Directly in front of the pharmacy. \n\nThe dress I am wearing is mid thigh length with a paisley pattern in fall colors. I was bending over to look at the bottom shelf, and could feel my dress was up too high over my butt. So as I reached back to pull it down, I heard a fucking camera shutter sound. At this point I was in disbelief, and straightened up to see a late 50\u2019s man walking towards the pharmacy with his phone in his hand. \n\nHe was holding it really weird with an awkward grip and I watched him get in line at the pharmacy, where he tilted his phone up to look at the screen.... and enough for me to see the picture of my ass with my dress pattern and black underwear.\n\nOnce I saw that, I yelled \u201cExcuse me!\u201d And everyone in the pharmacy, customers and pharmacists, stopped what they were doing to look at me. I took a step towards him, not wanting to walk away from the kids in the stroller. I yelled, \u201cDid you just take a picture of me??\u201d at the man. He mumbled back, \u201cuh I didn\u2019t....\u201d and looked down and away, at that point he walked off and everyone watching me was looking at me like I was crazy so I dashed away over to the books, where I alerted an employee despite the four pharmacists watching me yell at him. I saw him one more time in the store before I left. I just wanted to get out. \n\nI called Walmart once I got home, to make sure they followed up. The man who reviews security footage told me that the guy that took the picture was stalking me before he took the picture, he followed me from the fragrances over to pharmacy where he took the picture. \nI\u2019ve filed a police report and the footage is being saved for them to pick up on Wednesday. \n\nIf this happens in public please don\u2019t hesitate to call these people out about it.

This is just internalizing some really harmful transient concepts, instead of focusing on the positive that each person has.  As I type this, the front page of reddit has a picture of a man who was horribly burned and fits just about anyone's definition of physically \"ugly\" but if you click thru to the post you see a profoundly happy man holding his baby daughter.   Sure some comments are \"woah, how did such an ugly dude get laid\" or other such BS, but thankfully most look at the beauty and joy that this man *still* has and exudes, rather than the scars, finger stumps, and missing eye.  \n\nThe smile, the expression, the joy, the person, the PERSON is what\u2019s beautiful.\n\nAccepting ugly or identifying as ugly is a statement by a person that they are nothing more, or have nothing to offer others, other than an attempt at physical conformity to whatever facial or body shape is in vogue at the moment, or purchasing the latest tribal adornment at the mall.  It\u2019s an abdication of agency.  FFS, everyone *IS* beautiful, unless they\u2019ve given up and become pinched, mean, bitter, and negative.  (E.g. Paltrow is *not* beautiful because she\u2019s profoundly nuts and unpleasant, and no one thinks Cosby is a hunky dadbod to get old with anymore, because you just can\u2019t contain that much ugly inside and some spilled out onto the otherwise handsome exterior.)    Imho Gwendolyn Christie, Ron Perlman, Leslie Jones, Steve Buscemi  are some of the sexiest and most beautiful people alive in large part because their inner selves are just too damn strong and positive that you can\u2019t look away.  Lena Dunham is overweight and thoroughly average and yet is a sex symbol, and Gabourey Sidibe is undeniably beautiful in everything she does.  Kristen Schaal has a wonky eye and a corvette hood for a nose, and Peter Dinklage is .. um.. short and a bit unwieldy.. but would either one take more than 30 seconds to get a random kiss or a marriage proposal on a downtown street?   And skipping away from famous people, did you catch the big girl from Texas and her twiggy fianc\u00e9 who did a [this]( https://www.littlethings.com/body-positive-stephanie-arryn-photo-shoot/) photo shoot that was trending a few days ago?

I got my period the other night and all was fine and dandy until I got to work yesterday. Luckily my uniform consists of black shorts because I started losing a lot of blood. I knew something was wrong because I had just changed my tampon and I felt wet. I was covered in my own blood within five minutes. It was everywhere, I mean, I went through about 10 tampons before I walked out the door within a 15 minute time frame. When I got home, I ran into my house and was greeted by the father of my child who seemed enthusiastic to see me until I was yelling, \"I need to go to the hospital, NOW!\". We were driving and I was so embarrassed when I told him, \"I wish this could have happened around anybody but you.\" (mostly because I love him and I didn't want him to see me in such a vulnerable situation) which I immediately regretted saying because he told me he was the only person who knew how to make me laugh in a time like this, which is so true. It was just an uncomfortably awkward situation. I'm sitting in my passenger seat bleeding everywhere and passing clots the size of my hand. \n\nSo we got to the ER and they admit me immediately, they do blood work and find that I have low hemoglobin and prescribe iron as well as give me the Depo shot to slow the bleeding and hopefully stop my period until I can be seen by my OBGYN. While I'm waiting for my blood work to come in, I'm almost in tears and half way passing out when out of nowhere a pad comes flying at my face. This 32 year old man who I had given a beautiful son to threw a pad at my face to stop me from crying. I instantly burst into laughter and the tears turned from sad and scared to uncontrollable tears of joy.\n\nSo now I am in bed for the next couple days and I thought I would share my embarrassing story. It was very scary for me and I know this has to happen to other women. So if you're reading this and have gone through or are going through the same thing I went through, talk to your Doctor. Your period should not control your life or make it so you can't finish your day at work. It will never be enjoyable, but it shouldn't be in control of you. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help.

Provide admin and law enforcement  with a verbal account of this. You can take your notes to refer to, but, let them know you wrote things down to be certain to tell them everything. Do not give your copy of the events away to the school. Keep copies of your documentation at home and in more than one location. \n\nLaw enforcement may ask for a copy of your notes, so be certain you tell them it is your best recollection. School admin does not need a copy. They can refer to the contents of the police report.\n\nWith you parents as a support, Call law enforcement off campus. then, make an appointment with school administration. Let school admin know you are talking to them to let them know that you have already filed a police report, and that you are telling them what has occurred as a courtesy. When they suggest,( and they will),  that you should have come to them first, have a list of students and teachers, etc., who have witnessed any of the events.\n\n Those people are under no obligation to back up your story, but, some of them will. Tell them you believe that your personal safety is in question, and, that you are simply there to inform them of your situation, so that they can take appropriate admin steps to secure the safety of yourself and other potential female victims at the school. \n\nMake certain that one of your parents is present to prevent any bullying or unprofessional behavior by administrators. Depending on school and law enforcement response, you may need to seek the advice of an attorney. \n\nWhy have you waited so long?\n\nEdit: retired teacher and administrator, parent and years ago, victim of similar behavior.

There is this guy who apparently has this huge crush on me, but I didn't recently find out until about a few weeks ago. I recognize his face from some classes but don't know him personally. During lunch he came up to my table and kinda pulled me aside to talk to me. That's when he told me he liked me and wanted to know if I'd go out with him. To be completely honest I'm not attracted to him and am not trying to do relationships this year anyway. So I told him, \"Thank you for telling me, but I don't want a relationship right now\". He didn't really say anything after that and just walked away. I felt sorta bad afterwards because I had thought that maybe I wasn't gentle enough, but I didn't see him for about two days after that.\n\nThen one morning when I was at my locker he came up to me and asked me why I didn't want to go out. I told him that I was sorry but I just didn't want to. He got very upset by that and slammed my locker shut, calling me a shallow b*tch. It did hurt my feelings a little but I forgot about it all the way up to about 4th period, when I saw him in the hallway again. Now he has this habit where he'll yell out random insults and such whenever I walk by or he sees me, or try to block me when I'm walking.

She got ptsd after a rape which involved mdma at 16, and her dad(not my dad) abused her when she stayed with him as a child. She is a complicated person.\nShe lies a lot, likes to cause trouble and manipulate. She's good at it too. \n\nI can't keep count of all the times she's overstepped my boundaries. Stolen medicine and clothes, wrecked my room(and house) and destroyed valuables.\nShe is kind and caring too, but only to a degree. I never know what to believe. \n\nMy mother has some kind of personality disorder, possibly histrionic. I grew up to see my hero mom turn pill-abusing and alcoholic, who loves attention, positive and negative. I am always afraid to turn into her, even though she is loving and caring too.

My health is much better, been strength training for two years, therapy has been great, I play the piano, do gardening, learning Russian and have finally started school again, after many many tough years. Dad helped me with my math homework last night. I can't believe it. \n\nShe offered him mdma. He was drinking a little bit since it was Saturday after all. She even offered me some. She told mom she was concerned about what he might was doing to me. He has done nothing, ever. \nI only have one friend, my best friend but she lives hours away. \n\nI have a lot of trouble with knowing what is real and what is not, because of my mother and sister, as well as several toxic friendships over the years.

When I first met him he was sweet, compassionate, understanding, and very supportive. We have had our fair share of hard times, fights, misunderstandings, ect but we really loved each other, at first. He has helped me through a lot, ptsd, anxiety, ect. I have always tried hard to be supportive of him as well. \nOver the past year I have wanted to be a healthier person for both our sakes. I have started counseling and learning how to fight in a healthy way. \n\nAt the same time he has started to become more verbally aggressive. I have asked for us to get couples counseling but he wouldn't. It got to the point of him getting angry at me over anything at all and I had no idea why but was trying to stand up and defend myself. Today after he got angry at me for buying children's books for one of my friend's kid, I took a walk. I thought about how I didn't want to live this way and how I could have changed to make the situation better. Eventually I realized that there wasn't anything I could have done to avoid the situation and that by not breaking up with him not only was I saying his behavior was okay but also was making the inevitable be more painful then needed.\n\nI went back home and asked to talk with him. I said I didn't want to be with him anymore and that I didn't think our relationship was healthy. I expected him to either get angry and yell or tell me he was sorry and beg me to stay. Instead he told me that he had been expecting me to break up with him for months. That crushed me, I thought he cared about me and our relationship. I didn't know I was going to breakup with him until that day. \n\nI asked him if he could leave but he pulled the legal card and said he was staying since he is on the lease.

Let's call him James. He was nice, into the same shit I was, and I didn\u2019t have many friends, so I was grateful to have someone. \n\nAt this point, I identified as gay. He made it clear he was into me when we first started hanging out, and I politely shot him down, (Due to the fact he's 20 years older than me and I'm not attracted to him), and we went on. He made it clear that being friends with me was fine, and he has a lot of friends, including women, that genuinely are just friends, and of a broad age spectrum. 23-47 would be my guess. (I also have friends now in a broad age spectrum, which is how it's always been for me.)\n\nAt this point, I was also new in town. I didn\u2019t have many other friends, and I hadn\u2019t been around town, so I didn't have opinions on things. I was still exploring.\n\nFor a while, things were okay. We went out places, he introduced me to people. We have a friend's group (People right around my age) that does stuff together and we're part of the same DnD groups now. \n\nAll of this is fine. \n\nUntil recently. \n\nIt's been six months and things are now falling apart. \n\n**Problem #1. When I started going out with a woman named Claire, he ran a background check on her, via his friend at the police department. He found out everything from her high school GPA to her credit score, and then \"approved\" her for me. When I told him about the latest person I was into, he made it clear he planned to do the same for them, asking for his last name. He lacks boundaries of what's acceptable to do. He thinks because he wants to know something, he has every right to know it.** \n\n----\nLast Saturday, I had to clean my apartment, I'd been puttig it off for weeks, and I finally snapped. It was really, really bad. I just finished lunch and was about to start cleaning when I received a message from James on Facebook. He had turned on Live Location. And was parked outside my apartment. \n\nI told him I wasn't going anywhere, I had to clean. \"No, you don't.\" Yeah, I did. I had to fight with him to get him to stop trying to get me out of the apartment. So he stayed. For 4.5 hours and waited for me to finish cleaning. \n\nI did and we went out for pizza. It took me a few days to realize this was not okay. He should've accepted that I didn't want go anywhere and left me alone. \n\n**Problem #2. He acts entitled to my time and doesn't like it when I am unavailable. I told him that I had a sports thing for work and would miss movie night with our friends. \"Skip the thing.\" It's for charity. \"So?\" I want to go. \"No, you don't, you wanna hang with us.\" I can do that some other time. I'm sorry. \"Just come after.\" I have no idea how late it will go. \"That's fine, come after you're done.\" Dude, I'm gonna wanna go home and shower. \"No, you'll come to move night.\" (This is a real, almost verbatim, conversation we had in the past week.)**\n\n------\nSo, this weekend, my dad came to visit me for the first time since I moved. I told my friends he was coming a few months back. James immediately asked when he'd be meeting him. \"What makes you think you will?\" \"I meet everyone.\" \n\nI explained to him back on Friday that no one would be meeting my father or my brother. He basically pouted. We were to have a nice, family weekend, and I'd see everyone on Monday. My family showed up Friday evening, and left this morning. They never met my friends, and James has not spoken to me in that time. The longest he's gone without saying anything to me since I moved here. \n\n**Problem #3 - He acts entitled to my life. If it's happening, he has the right to be a part of it. He doesn't really ask, or wait to be invited. I made sure not to mention places my family and I were in our Facebook group chat (James, I and two other friends) on the fear he would \"randomly\" show up.**\n\n----------------\nI recently enrolled in Community College. I found out how much I would be receiving in financial aid. I expressed to my friends that I was planning on buying a netbook to take to class. My one friend just told me not to feel pressured to buy the one in the campus bookstore, they tend to be cheaply made. I can spend the money anywhere, so I should do my research. If I want help, let him know. James, however, immediately answered, \"If I were you, I wouldn't get a netbook.\" I immediately told him I was telling him what I planned to do. Not asking his opinion. The conversation came to an abrupt halt and we barely spoke to each other for the remainder of the evening. \n\n**Problem #4 - When I first moved here, I did ask his opinion on things because I was new and didn't know about this place. Now I have plans and opinions of my own making and he acts as though I'm being a b*tch because I'm not tolerating his constant \"guidance\" anymore.**\n\n--------------\nThe thing that really tipped the scales and threw everything into mayhem for our friendship was my most recent relationship development. I said there was someone at work I was into. He asked what her name was. \"Adam.\"\n\nMe dating women was fine, but when I started dating people who were male and not him, things were... touchy at best. \n\n**Problem #5 - Things were fine when I was dating women, but as soon as I showed interest in guys who were him, things got awkward. Yes, I did flirt with him. I also flirted with literally all of my other friends. I am a natural flirt. This means nothing and all of my friends know that. One of my male friends, upon finding out about me being bi, dropped a hint he'd be into dating me. I playfully declined and it did not affect our friendship. James is acting as though me dating men who aren't him is some kind of betrayal.**\n\n-----------\nFor a while, my friend Bianca and I were planning on being roommates with James, 4-bedroom apartments are common around here, and we all hate living alone. It seemed like a good idea. Then Bianca and I talked about it, away from James, and we both agreed it's a terrible idea because James has this attitude that if we are doing something alone, watching TV, playing a video game, we should want to do it with him. Alone time wouldn't exist for either of us. In the words of Bianca, \"We would never be able to excuse ourselves from whatever plans he makes.\"\n\n**Problem #6. Lack of respect for boundaries. Again.**\n\n---------------\nI expressed concerns about being smart enough to get my degree, or qualified to get the job I wanted. \"You'll be fine. You'll get it.\" And not in an encouraging \"what can I do?\" kind of way. In a condescending way like I'm being ridiculous for having concerns. And he does this about a lot of things. He knows I have an anxiety disorder, so it's like none of my anxieties are rooted in reality. \n\n**Problem #7. He acts like my concerns and anxieties are just me being silly and he never takes me seriously when I'm unhappy or worried about something.** \n\n------------\nRecently, we went out to lunch with a couple of friends. I was telling our friend Ashton about a comedian on Netflix, (Iliza Shlesinger). I was explaining how much I love her and I feel like if I were a comedian, I'd have the same sense of humor as her. James replied, \"All you need is a sense of humor.\" I asked why he did that, always trying to piss me off randomly. \"I do it. I don't try.\" Fine, why do it at all? \"It's how I show love.\" \"If that's love, you can shove it up your ass, I don't need it.\" The rest of the meal was awkward between the two of us. \n\n**Problem 8. He \"roasts\" me whenever he likes and laughs when I get upset.** \n\n---------------\nI told him I wasn't sure I wanted to go home for Christmas because of my family. He started making plans for us to take my car down to Florida to be with his family for the holidays.\n\n**Problem 9. He acts like we're dating when we're clearly not. He left his hoodie in my car. As a joke, I told him I was keeping it. I expect him to fight for it back. Nope. If anything, he encouraged me to keep it and wear it. I only managed to get him to take it back by throwing it in his car window right before he drove away.** \n\n-----------\ntl;dr: Friend has plethora of boundary issues and acts like me dating men who aren't him is some kind of betrayal. \n\nAm I right to be upset by this behavior? Should I have known better than to try to have male friends? Or is this just how some guys are?

I have been in the same relationship for the past 13 yrs now and married for 3 yrs. I'm 28 and his 32. We have two kids together (8yrs and 2 yrs old). I work nightshift and last week I came home during my break, I found my husband with another woman. He claims that this was only the 2nd time she spent the night, the first one they had sex and \"it didn't mean anything\". The second time he was just letting her crash because she didn't have a place to go to. He believes somehow I'm the one to blame because I wouldn't let him touch me when I would  get back from work. Yes, that's true to some extend but a moth ago every time I would try to start something he was the one tired all the time.  I even asked him if there was someone else and he would denied it every single time. \n\nAfter all this, I asked him to never touch me again and that we were done. I've filed for divorce already but I'm just such a wreck right now. Somewhere in the bottom of heart I believe we can work it out. I know I'm being naive by even thinking this since yesterday he went to the gym around 9pm and never came back until 4 pm the next day and he left right away  again. I've a feeling he spent the whole time with her. \n\nI don't know what to do at this point. Should I just pretend that I don't care at all or should I confront him? I feel like I have given him all my youth and now he cheats on me with a 22 yr old. I also had asked him to move out but he told me won't go and I could do whatever I want but he's not leaving because of the kids. \n\nI went over my budget and I could get my own place, money will be tight but it is feasible. If I stay here we would split everything until the lease is up in July.  If I stay, i will be able to pay off all of my debt (20k). I just don't know if I can stay here. What if he keeps bringing her when I go to work. I also don't like to watch him leave and pretend that he's single already. \n\nOne more thing that bugs me is the fact that I didn't see her when everything happened. I want to see what she looks like, I believe it will giveme some closure. I don't want to talk to her, since I've got nothing to talk to her about i just want to see what she looks like.  \n\nIf you made it this far I really appreciate it. Any advice is welcome.

When I went to check who may be logged in, I saw that my ex husband had been logging into my Facebook from his phone from the time he was blocked when I left up until very recently. \n\nI don\u2019t post a whole lot on there, but my boyfriend and I do use Facebook Messenger to communicate. I don\u2019t think my ex had access to these conversations. He would have said something if he knew what we\u2019d been saying to one another and it doesn\u2019t look like his phone was used to log into messenger under my account, just Facebook. \n\nI\u2019m furious and feel violated. I was emotionally and financially abused for a decade by this man. I tried to get a protective order against him around this time for his stalking behavior and harassment and was told by the judge that because he never hit me an apologized he was harmless. This just shows me that his behavior was worse than I imagined. \n\nI changed my passwords on everything I could think of, not knowing what else he has been logging into. But it doesn\u2019t even feel worth it to confront him about this. He\u2019s a pathetic an petty man, we have no kids together or anything. I just want him to leave me alone. \n\nI\u2019m facing the fact that this kind of crap will continue. He will continue to spy on me to try and keep me under his thumb. He will probably try to open up credit in my name until the day I die. I will never be fully separated from him, despite my divorce being final. I will never be able to fully move on from his abuse because he will never move on from me. \n\nBecause he \u201cnever hurt me\u201d I can\u2019t to anything about it in the courts. \n\nI know this seems like a minor inconvenience.

I'm not sure if this is just me being self centered or if this is actually a problem so I'm hoping to hear what you all think. Something I  routinely notice in the family unit is how little the woman seems to matter. Meaning she isn't to be considered in how she feels except, for the most part, during her wedding and when she's pregnant. Maybe it's just because I'm from the south but it's like any other time beyond that ones a woman is married and has children she's not supposed to have anything she really needs, and if she tried to assert those needs she's a harpy bitch.  Something I see a lot of is if something happens to the husband the only thought seems to be \"Oh what about the children.\" No one cares much if he had a partner left behind or how it will effect her. Of course the children are of much concern and the mother should try to be as strong as she can for them. But what about how her own life is effected?\n\n* I guess my point is, is this self centered? Or is the woman in the picture always expected to basically nut up and shut up about her own needs once she's married or had kids? \n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who replied. To be more specific, I'm mainly talking about the pressure coming from other women. And I guess to be fair I was raised in a fairly toxic environment. No, not all of the south is bad, but there are plenty of places heavily influenced by religion where woman eat last and aren't aloud to pray etc.. No man has ever called me a harpy bitch, but my SO's side of the family thinks I'm Satan for wanting time with him without the little one and those words have floated around from them. And my side of the family doesn't say much but it's unheard of to take time to themselves without it being forced on them. It just feels like if I set boundaries and try to take I'm being selfish.

This led to long conversations on IG that turned into texting that turned into phone calls. Our conversations were extremely intimate, sharing the paths our lives had led since we knew each other as children. We joked about our failed relationships and skewed outlook on love, our shared passion for music, our yoga practices....nearly everything. \n\nWe spoke every day for a few weeks before he left the country for a 1 week holiday. The only thing he said about his current relationship status was that (he had) \"Dated the same girl for many years\" and he was recently out of that relationship. He said it \"screwed up his outlook on love\". I assumed he was freshly out of a very serious relationship. That was sort of a red flag, but i am not looking for anything serious, and love talking to him so i didn't think much of it. We also briefly spoke about how we are both monogamous (apparently i give off a poly vibe, whatever that means haha). He hinted a few times about wanting to come visit me when he's back (he has lots of family/friends in this area), and has said some other things that hint he is very interested in me. \n\nSince he has been gone, i have had proper time to FB stalk him. I found his ex-gf's facebook, and yesterday she posted a photo of them laughing in front of a scenic overview! I honestly laughed out loud! Him and i have been texting long messages every day since he's been gone. Never-mind feeling silly myself..i am just so annoyed that this prick wasted my time! And what about his GF? I am just so tired of people mistreating their partners - in my eyes this was a small emotional affair. If my partner had the type of conversations him and i were having with someone else (I mean he talked about where he wanted to put his hands, the places he wanted to take me...)

The movement spread across the nation, initially as a form of support against the abuses and violence to which the police met the groups. The movement blend specific regional demands in each area but with different pressure groups pushing forward their agendas; what started as a movement for the defense of rights for students and commuters, started to feel like general insatisfaction of the population.\n\n\nIn 2014 a new election was bound to take place, in which a figure considered an outlier (Marina Silva) stayed in the first place for weeks. Two major forces clashed into the fiercest presidential dispute since the redemocratization. One side a very divided government led by the Workers' Party (PT) with Dilma Rouseff and the opposition led by (PSDB) with A\u00e9cio Neves. The Workers' Party won by a very tiny margin and the new government was formed amid protests against corruption and presidential manipulation of the economic ratings to deceive the population.\n\n\n\nThe government faced an ever increasing disapproval from the general population, fueled by the constant boycott of Dilma's government, millions went to the streets to ask for her removal. Her oppositors in Congress, helped create more political instability, which had a deep effect in the country's economy. Plus, the corruption accusations during the Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato led to the final demise of her government. Her vice president, Michel Temer, conducted a campaign as the man who could fix the economy and put the country back on track but already started his mandate under protests from left wing parties and other pressure groups. His ministries are constantly being investigated, more than 10 names already left due to the poltical crisis and the ongoing investigation. He's widely unpopular by now due to his economic agenda and the changes proposed to make the country competitive again. His failure to curb down corruption and bring economical growth makes the general public tolerate him until the general ellections take place again in 2018. A new right wing name is increasing in populatiry (Jair Bolsonaro), a retired army official which already served as a deputy, remembered by his very conservative views on social matters and anti-left policies. On the other side, the former president (Lu\u00eds In\u00e1cio 'Lula' da Silva) from the Workers' Party, is trying to launch himself into the political race despite the corruption scandals related to his name, to which he denies any wrongdoing, appealing to the masses and their memory of a prosperous past with him ahead of the country.\n\n\nBecause Lula is currently ahead, the more conservative population views any protest against Temer as a way to help him and the Workers' Party indirectly, so despite the very low ratings, most people still would prefer the current government. There's a chance Lula will not be able to run for president due to the investigations. This would put the conservative Jair Balsonaro ahead of the pools by a good margin. I think Brazil will be soon joining the the right wing governments gaining force across the globe: The US, UK and more recently Germany already showed how the conservatives are here to stay, presenting every single solution to the complex problems we face as a society.

The President is invoking the same statutory authority (INA \u00a7 212(f)) for the ban as before, the waiver system is the same, but the limitations are more individually targeted to specific countries.\n\n* This will see immediate challenge in the courts, likely by next week.

[His concession speech in 2008 foretold a warning of what we see now.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96631784)\n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Sen. Barack Obama \u2014 to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans, who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president, is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight.\n\nI've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Sen. Obama believes that, too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to visit \u2014 to dine at the White House \u2014 was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States. Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth.\n\nSen. Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day \u2014 though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nSen. Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our goodwill and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises, to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans. And please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought \u2014 we fought as hard as we could.\n\nAnd though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset. But your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI am especially grateful to my wife, Cindy, my children, my dear mother and all my family and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude, and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to Gov. Sarah Palin, one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her husband, Todd, and their five beautiful children, with their tireless dedication to our cause, and the courage and grace they showed in the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter, to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenged campaign in modern times \u2014 thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life. And my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Sen. Obama and my old friend, Sen. Joe Biden, should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\nI would not be an American worthy of the name, should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today, I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much. And tonight, I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone and I thank the people of Arizona for it.\n\nTonight \u2014 tonight, more than any night, I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Sen. Obama, I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president.\n\nAnd I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here.\n\nAmericans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.
