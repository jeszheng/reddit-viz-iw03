Watt is the power/energy equivalent of speed, whereas kilowatthour is the equivalent of distance. You're charged per kWh just like you would be charged based on distance, not speed, by a transportation agency.\n\n*Full:* The story starts with the unit Joule (J). This unit expresses an amount of energy. A rather small amount, that is. In many cases, it is useful to not only consider the total amount of energy used, but also the rate at which energy is used as a function of time. So you might consider looking at Joule-per-second (J/s). A device that uses 20 J/s will use a total of 1000 J if used for 50 seconds. This is similar to how speed, time and distance interact: An object traveling at 20 meters per second for 50 seconds will travel 1000 meters.\n\nSince J/s is used so often, a shorthand unit was introduced for it: The Watt (W). 1 W is simply 1 J/s. When we have a device and want to express its power consumption, we do so using Watt. A lightbulb might use 60 W, a microwave oven 1,000 W. This tells us nothing about the total amount of energy used unless we also know how long the device is in use. 60 seconds of microwaving with the previously mentioned oven will use up 60,000 J of energy. It takes 1,000 seconds of having this 60 W lightbulb on to get the same amount of energy consumption.\n\nSince many devices are run for considerably longer than seconds, numbers tend to get rather big and clumsy to work with. Which is why people started using the unit \"Watt-hour\" (Wh), which is a multiplication of the power consumption in Watt and the running time in hours. The outcome is another measure of energy (similar to how you can measure speed both in meters per second and meters per hour, two different ways of measuring the same thing). 1 Wh is the amount of energy used by a 1 W device running for 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 3,600 seconds, this means that 1 Wh is equal to 3,600 J.\n\nSince numbers still get big rather quickly, because many devices use tens or hundreds of Watt, the \"kilo-\" (k) prefix is commonly used to denote multiples of 1,000. So 1 kWh stands for the energy consumption of a 1 kW device operating for 1 hour. Or a 1 W device running for 1000 hours. It's equal to 3,600,000 J.\n\nkWh has become the common way to measure energy consumption of households and businesses, because it offers enough precision without having to go way beyond the decimal point, yet still yields numbers that are small enough to easily grasp and work with.\n\nBy now, I hope it's obvious why you're charged by the kWh and not by the kW. The amount of kW used is fairly meaningless, because it changes constantly as you use different devices. It is a measure of how quickly you consume energy. And you're charged based on how much you consume in total.\n", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 143142, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 12:09:20 2017", "ups": 5}, {"body": "kWh is energy. kW is power.\n\nThey charge you for the energy you use, not for the power required to use the appliance.

What we surmise is that preterm birth is a complex problem that seems to have both a strong genetic component (e.g. it appears heritable) and an environmental component (e.g. preterm rates vary between countries). \n\nThe genetics of parturition is especially complicated because even in the same mother, every pregnancy involves a novel combination of genes. While the mother's genome (her DNA) remains a constant, the fetus' genome is a 50-50 mix of genes from mom and dad. This is vital point because both the fetus and the mom make a very important organ called the [placenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta).  Because the fetal component of the placenta will contain different sets of genes from pregnancy to pregnancy, and because the genetics of preterm birth are often only focuses on the mother's genotype, it's likely that we are missing a very large fraction of genetic picture.\n\nLikewise, the environmental component is tricky because of multiple confounders, many of them unknown.  For example, here is the [WHO's list](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/) of countries with the highest ~~rates~~ numbers of preterm birth. \n\n* India: 3 519 100\n* China: 1 172 300\n* Nigeria: 773 600\n* Pakistan: 748 100\n* Indonesia: 675 700\n* The United States of America: 517 400\n* Bangladesh: 424 100\n* The Philippines: 348 900\n* The Democratic Republic of the Congo: 341 400\n* Brazil: 279 300\n\nNotice that he USA us right in there.  Surprised? In fact, the US has the highest pre-term rate of any industrialized country and no one has a good answer as to why. Some of the biggest predictors seem to be both the prevalence of C-sections in the US and the reduction of inter-pregnancy intervals; both of these independently increase the risk of a preterm birth, and they often occur together in the US. So the implication is that among environmental factors, even our reproductive medicine can interfere long-term with the natural mechanisms of parturition.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 22413, "stickied": false, "score": 71, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 16:49:33 2017", "ups": 71}, {"body": "Preface: nursing student that took OB about 8 months ago on a cell phone. So excuse the lack of formatting and grammar and possible autocorrect sabotage. \n\nThere isn't a prefect, defined signal.  There are a lot of things happening at the end of gestation that can cause a baby to come early or late or on time. One of these is the growth and development of the fetus and when things are developed and it's just growing. If i rememeber correctly this is around 37 or 38 weeks. \n\nAnother is the placenta, where the nutrients are exchanged between mom and fetus. Around 42 weeks the placenta will start to decline in function because it's done it's job and isn't programmed to last much longer. This is one reason they don't want people to go past 42 weeks. \n\nMother's health and any chronic conditions also play into it. If she has been having high blood pressure or gestational diabetes that can change when things \"go\" or how big the fetus gets at certain points in time. This can cause her to carry longer or shorter depending on how her body handles things \n\nThere is also moms body being triggered to go into labor when the fetus settles into the pelvis and pushes on the cervix, along with stretching of the lower uterus, etc. Fetus knows when it's ready the majority of the time (Not a conscious \"let's do this\" but more of a hormone and cell signal type thing) and starts to move into position. \n\nIt's really a concert of hormones and receptors and signals that all work together to determine the right time.  Sometimes those things trigger at the wrong time, or something happens to mom and that triggers it (trauma, drugs, disease, poor cervical tone, etc). Sometimes it's the anatomy of mom and her cervix can't hold shut well enough so when there's too much it decides it's labor time, or often this can cause miscarriages earlier in the pregnancy. There are a variety of other things that can cause those as well. \n\nAnd of course, emergencies can cause mom to need to go into labor or have a c-section earlier than they want because of risk of death to either mom or fetus. I know someone who had a baby at 28 weeks because her blood pressure was dangerously high and she was going blind (preeclampsia). Both of them are great now, but he had to spend a few weeks in the NICU since he was so small. \n\nI hope that helps. There's so many thing but I tried to cover some of the big ones we learned about.

GABA is mostly studied in terms of neuroscience and the \u03c0-subunit DOESNT occur in the brain so it frankly gets almost no attention. The fact that it occurs in the uterine walls though is perhaps a big hint. As a side note, the project taught me something else about studies-- people are a lot more likely to pour money into Alzheimer's than a very common issue that few people realise is a medical conundrum. It taught me to REALLY drive home the impact of a disease. The current treatment for preterm birth is either to hope for the best or tocolytic drugs to essentially freeze the birth like sticking a plug up there. They can have utterly horrendous side effects and are becoming more and more frowned upon. Understanding the chemical basis of preterm birth is essential then-- we can only design safer and specific drugs and more importantly a way to detect it occuring early if we understand the mechanism causing the issue.\n\nEdit: A point of clarification: the study was more sold as a potential *biomarker* of preterm labor.

The fact that the edit occurs in the \u03c0 subunit acts to prevent such deregulation in other GABA rich areas-- the most notable of course being the brain.\n\nDo note that unless further research has been done recently that this is all a hypothesis we came to. Our study was preliminary and a lot more work was needed when I graduated.\n\nThe biochemistry and endocrinology of preterm labor is absolutely an area of active research right now. GABA is mostly studied in terms of neuroscience and the \u03c0-subunit DOESNT occur in the brain so it frankly gets almost no attention. The fact that it occurs in the uterine walls though is perhaps a big hint. As a side note, the project taught me something else about studies-- people are a lot more likely to pour money into Alzheimer's than a very common issue that few people realise is a medical conundrum. It taught me to REALLY drive home the impact of a disease. The current treatment for preterm birth is either to hope for the best or tocolytic drugs to essentially freeze the birth like sticking a plug up there. They can have utterly horrendous side effects and are becoming more and more frowned upon. Understanding the chemical basis of preterm birth is essential then-- we can only design safer and specific drugs and more importantly a way to detect it occuring early if we understand the mechanism causing the issue.\n\nEdit: A point of clarification: the study was more sold as a potential *biomarker* of preterm labor. Drugs are a lofty goal indeed, but one of the reasons preterm labor is so nasty is that once it's started its already too late. Finding a biochemical change that can be monitored would be a huge boon.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 18354, "stickied": false, "score": 898, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 16:55:11 2017", "ups": 898}, {"body": "This is a really good question.\n\nThere is a lot of research going into understanding the biology and genetics of parturition and the simple answer right now is \"we don't know\".  \n\nPreterm birth (defined in humans as giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy) is a particularly important focus of research because it is *the* leading cause of infant mortality. What we surmise is that preterm birth is a complex problem that seems to have both a strong genetic component (e.g. it appears heritable) and an environmental component (e.g. preterm rates vary between countries). \n\nThe genetics of parturition is especially complicated because even in the same mother, every pregnancy involves a novel combination of genes. While the mother's genome (her DNA) remains a constant, the fetus' genome is a 50-50 mix of genes from mom and dad. This is vital point because both the fetus and the mom make a very important organ called the [placenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta).  Because the fetal component of the placenta will contain different sets of genes from pregnancy to pregnancy, and because the genetics of preterm birth are often only focuses on the mother's genotype, it's likely that we are missing a very large fraction of genetic picture.\n\nLikewise, the environmental component is tricky because of multiple confounders, many of them unknown.  For example, here is the [WHO's list](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/) of countries with the highest ~~rates~~ numbers of preterm birth. \n\n* India: 3 519 100\n* China: 1 172 300\n* Nigeria: 773 600\n* Pakistan: 748 100\n* Indonesia: 675 700\n* The United States of America: 517 400\n* Bangladesh: 424 100\n* The Philippines: 348 900\n* The Democratic Republic of the Congo: 341 400\n* Brazil: 279 300\n\nNotice that he USA us right in there.  Surprised? In fact, the US has the highest pre-term rate of any industrialized country and no one has a good answer as to why. Some of the biggest predictors seem to be both the prevalence of C-sections in the US and the reduction of inter-pregnancy intervals; both of these independently increase the risk of a preterm birth, and they often occur together in the US. So the implication is that among environmental factors, even our reproductive medicine can interfere long-term with the natural mechanisms of parturition.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 22413, "stickied": false, "score": 72, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 16:49:33 2017", "ups": 72}, {"body": "Preface: nursing student that took OB about 8 months ago on a cell phone. So excuse the lack of formatting and grammar and possible autocorrect sabotage. \n\nThere isn't a prefect, defined signal.  There are a lot of things happening at the end of gestation that can cause a baby to come early or late or on time. One of these is the growth and development of the fetus and when things are developed and it's just growing. If i rememeber correctly this is around 37 or 38 weeks. \n\nAnother is the placenta, where the nutrients are exchanged between mom and fetus. Around 42 weeks the placenta will start to decline in function because it's done it's job and isn't programmed to last much longer. This is one reason they don't want people to go past 42 weeks. \n\nMother's health and any chronic conditions also play into it. If she has been having high blood pressure or gestational diabetes that can change when things \"go\" or how big the fetus gets at certain points in time. This can cause her to carry longer or shorter depending on how her body handles things \n\nThere is also moms body being triggered to go into labor when the fetus settles into the pelvis and pushes on the cervix, along with stretching of the lower uterus, etc. Fetus knows when it's ready the majority of the time (Not a conscious \"let's do this\" but more of a hormone and cell signal type thing) and starts to move into position. \n\nIt's really a concert of hormones and receptors and signals that all work together to determine the right time.  Sometimes those things trigger at the wrong time, or something happens to mom and that triggers it (trauma, drugs, disease, poor cervical tone, etc). Sometimes it's the anatomy of mom and her cervix can't hold shut well enough so when there's too much it decides it's labor time, or often this can cause miscarriages earlier in the pregnancy. There are a variety of other things that can cause those as well. \n\nAnd of course, emergencies can cause mom to need to go into labor or have a c-section earlier than they want because of risk of death to either mom or fetus. I know someone who had a baby at 28 weeks because her blood pressure was dangerously high and she was going blind (preeclampsia). Both of them are great now, but he had to spend a few weeks in the NICU since he was so small. \n\nI hope that helps. There's so many thing but I tried to cover some of the big ones we learned about.

How many progressives who celebrated the First Amendment on Sunday sympathize with college students who chant \u201cspeech is violence\u201d and seek to block conservatives from college campuses?\n\n>The hypocrisy runs the other way, too. I was startled to see many conservatives who decried Google\u2019s termination of a young, dissenting software engineer work overtime yesterday to argue that Trump was somehow in the right. Yet Google is a private corporation and Trump is the most powerful government official in the land. The First Amendment applies to Trump, not Google, and his demands for reprisals are ultimately far more ominous, given his job, than even the actions of the largest corporations. Google, after all, has competitors. Google commands no police force. Everything it does is replaceable.\n\n>In the space of less than 24 hours this weekend, the president of the United States did more to politicize sports than ESPN has done in a decade of biased, progressive programming. He singled out free speech he didn\u2019t like, demanded that dissenters be fired, and then \u2014 when it became clear that private American citizens weren\u2019t going to do what he demanded \u2014 he urged the economic boycott of their entire industry.\n\n>He told his political opponents on the football field \u2014 men who have defined their lives and careers by their mental and physical toughness \u2014 to essentially, \u201cDo what I say or lose your job.\u201d In so doing, he put them in straits far more difficult to navigate than anything Colin Kaepernick has wrought: Stand and they are seen to obey a man who just abused his office, and millions of Americans will view them as a sellout not just to the political cause they love but also to the Constitution itself; kneel and they defy a rogue president, but millions of Americans will view them as disrespecting the nation itself to score political points against a president those Americans happen to like.\n\n>At one stroke, thanks to an attempted vulgar display of strength, Trump changed the playing of the anthem and the display of the flag from a moment where all but the most radical Americans could unite to one where millions of well-meaning Americans could and did legitimately believe that the decision to kneel represented a defense of the ideals of the flag, not defiance of the nation they love.\n\n>So, yes, I understand why they knelt. I understand why men who would never otherwise bring politics onto the playing field \u2014 and never had politicized sports before \u2014 felt that they could not be seen to comply with a demagogue\u2019s demands. I understand why even owners who gave millions to Trump expressed solidarity with their players. I understand why even Trump supporters like Rex Ryan were appalled at the president\u2019s actions.\n\n>I fear that those who proclaimed yesterday\u2019s events a \u201cwin\u201d for the president \u2014 after all, many of the players were booed for their stance, and in American politics you generally don\u2019t want to be seen as taking sides against the flag \u2014 are missing the forest for the trees. If we lose respect for the First Amendment, then politics becomes purely about power. If we no longer fight to secure the same rights for others that we demand for ourselves, we become more tribal, and America becomes less exceptional.\n\n>I respect Pittsburgh Steelers left tackle (and former Army ranger) Alejandro Villanueva, who \u2014 alone among his teammates \u2014 came out of the locker room to stand for the pledge while the rest of his team remained off the field.

If you are driving with your family and a woman with a baby stroller jumps in front of your car suddenly, and you have the time to decide if you should drive off a cliff or hit the woman, I am hitting the woman 100% of the time. It is just human instinct to preserve your own life over a stranger's even if the moral thought experiment doesn't have a black and white answer. If every car is programmed to protect it's own passengers then the cars will act in a predictable manner and each car will know what the other one is doing and act accordingly, therefore minimizing damage. By the time these cars are widespread it makes sense that groups of cars within a certain distance of each other will establish a local intranet wirelessly so they can coordinate in case of accidents or unexpected circumstances. This would ensure everyone has the highest chance of survival if the software is written properly.\n\nAs for liability whomever owns the car should have insurance, just like people have insurance now for when they are at fault. The manufacturer should only be liable if the accident was cause by their negligence, like not programming around accepted safety standards or a manufacturer defect. If the car is part of a taxi service or a fleet of rentable cars, the owner has insurance. Remember for the car to be at fault, there either has to be some type of negligence on the part of the manufacturer of the car, OR the pedestrian themselves are at fault. If someone walks in front of a car so suddenly that even a computer 1000's of time faster than a human has no time to react, then the pedestrian is at fault. Same thing if I run out on a highway now in front of a truck, I can't sue the driver if I live. These cars will also have black boxes that can preserve every detail of the accident just like an airplane, so fault should be easy to determine.\n\nWhat a lot of people seem to miss is that self driving cars will more than likely cut down on accidents by an order of magnitude. Accidents should become exceedingly rare as the roads are given over to automation. They can't get tired, get distracted, go too fast, be a teenager, get drunk, brake too quickly, or any of the myriad of things that cause most accidents. If accidents become incredibly rare then liability isn't really a big deal anyway since insurance payouts will also be just as rare. \n\nEdit: Grammar", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2309, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 14:42:11 2017", "ups": 1}], "contest_mode": false, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "top_comments": [{"body": "Self-driving cars will need new legislation: Will the driver be hold accountable or the producing company?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 220, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 13:08:02 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "Way to be months, if not years, behind the debate.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 204215, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 13:10:34 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": ">Self-Driving Cars Will Kill People.\n\nSays who ?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 91048, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 13:05:43 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Remember when WIRED was peripherally relevant?

If the car is part of a taxi service or a fleet of rentable cars, the owner has insurance. Remember for the car to be at fault, there either has to be some type of negligence on the part of the manufacturer of the car, OR the pedestrian themselves are at fault. If someone walks in front of a car so suddenly that even a computer 1000's of time faster than a human has no time to react, then the pedestrian is at fault. Same thing if I run out on a highway now in front of a truck, I can't sue the driver if I live. These cars will also have black boxes that can preserve every detail of the accident just like an airplane, so fault should be easy to determine.\n\nWhat a lot of people seem to miss is that self driving cars will more than likely cut down on accidents by an order of magnitude. Accidents should become exceedingly rare as the roads are given over to automation. They can't get tired, get distracted, go too fast, be a teenager, get drunk, brake too quickly, or any of the myriad of things that cause most accidents. If accidents become incredibly rare then liability isn't really a big deal anyway since insurance payouts will also be just as rare. \n\nEdit: Grammar", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2309, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 14:42:11 2017", "ups": 1}], "title": "Self-Driving Cars Will Kill People.

I finish telling the story, and out of the blue she goes \"So Krafty I have this friend and do you know what we call him?\" and naturally I'm like \"Umm What?\" and she goes \"N----r Charles*\" My jaw drops to the floor. Actually, it takes me a minute to register what she just said. Then a surge of anger goes through me. I'm a little tipsy so I'm actively trying to control myself. I go, \"That's offputting! Don't you ever use that word again!\" She runs crying into her dorm and a group of my other friends sitting nearby run up to me (I'm shaking at this point) and ask me what happened. I tell them everything, and then Dicey comes up behind me crying saying \"how dare\" I talk about her with my other friends. Rather than shaming her in front of the group, I pull Dicey out of earshot and tell her that I can't associate with people who use that word.\n\nFast forward to the next day Dicey texts me asking if we can talk so I'm like ok fine. During our talk she apologizes, and I tell her that while I get she's sorry what she said was disgusting and totally uncalled for. Then she starts going on about how everyone hates her now (this is sort of true, but many of these people didn't like her to begin with because she said other problematic stuff) and starts with the \"woe is me\" nonsense.

She's right about Nazi's having a right to protest, but her theory that NFL Players can't/shouldn't protest while at work is flawed.\n\nThe bottom line is that every American has the right to protest anything at any time so long as they don't infringe upon the legal rights of others while doing so.  And if any employer is aware of your protest, and disagrees with it, they can fire you.\n\nWe saw this with Nazi's losing their jobs when their pictures were posted on social media after Charlottesville.  But with the NFL Players, while the owners *could* fire their players, they aren't doing that **because the owners agree with the protests**.  This is obvious because many of the owners stood with their players and/or made social media posts in support of their players yesterday.\n\nSo what it really boils down to is that your Mom is the one who if \"off the reservation\" with regard to the NFL protests, because everyone in authority in the NFL - including the commissioner - is fine with the protest.  She, and the President, can disagree all they want.  But if the owners support the players, no one is losing their job.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2241, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 23:31:02 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "If this makes you lose respect for your mother, then it must not have been very high. She should not be concerned with the protesters in the NFL, but does have a point that they are in the work place and depending on their team and ownership may be breaking protocol. So that is an iffy subject because while they have a right to protest, doing so while on the job can be an issue. \n\nBut to her defense of the rights of hate groups to speak or protest is sound. Saying people should be allowed to have their views and words regardless of their context is fine. Speech is a human right, so unless they are actively killing people or attacking them physically, all they are doing is saying mean things. But there are just as many if not more people saying mean things about them. And both sides have that right. Your right to decide you are trans and to speak out against those who feel you don't is just as protected an act. Law and rights must be impartial in their creation to avoid even more inequality than already exists. \n\nNo one can validate your feelings and self other than you. You are justified in feeling how you feel, because that is how you feel. No one can decide that other than you. But remember that if disagreement is enough to make you lose respect for someone, then you'll never respect anyone because we all disagree on things we feel are important. So just take a breather and remember she is your mother, and if she loves you for who you are, nothing she defends or is against will affect that. And nothing from the conversation you present shows she would be okay with people killing you or liking that they hate you. She is simply saying folks got rights to not like people and be vocal about it. But she also points out you can do so at work, but may get fired for it. As for disrespecting troops and the country, no song or act of standing makes you patriotic. Neither does being a soldier. A soldier in today's military is there as a job. He isn't fighting for the direct freedom or sake of America. What makes one a patriot is defending your nation and calling out your nation when things are good or bad. So in a way, your argument with your mother was an act of patriotism on both sides. No those jerks who preach hate, they are using their right, but they are not patriots. Those who protest a certain thing, are just people who might want to be a patriot. \n\nI say go hug your mother, and tell her you may disagree, but love is what matters. If she feels the same, then all is well. And remember that arguments and disagreements are part of all relationships.

She's right about Nazi's having a right to protest, but her theory that NFL Players can't/shouldn't protest while at work is flawed.\n\nThe bottom line is that every American has the right to protest anything at any time so long as they don't infringe upon the legal rights of others while doing so.  And if any employer is aware of your protest, and disagrees with it, they can fire you.\n\nWe saw this with Nazi's losing their jobs when their pictures were posted on social media after Charlottesville.  But with the NFL Players, while the owners *could* fire their players, they aren't doing that **because the owners agree with the protests**.  This is obvious because many of the owners stood with their players and/or made social media posts in support of their players yesterday.\n\nSo what it really boils down to is that your Mom is the one who if \"off the reservation\" with regard to the NFL protests, because everyone in authority in the NFL - including the commissioner - is fine with the protest.  She, and the President, can disagree all they want.  But if the owners support the players, no one is losing their job.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2241, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 23:31:02 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Because they are in the public eye for entertainment not politics.

She should not be concerned with the protesters in the NFL, but does have a point that they are in the work place and depending on their team and ownership may be breaking protocol. So that is an iffy subject because while they have a right to protest, doing so while on the job can be an issue. \n\nBut to her defense of the rights of hate groups to speak or protest is sound. Saying people should be allowed to have their views and words regardless of their context is fine. Speech is a human right, so unless they are actively killing people or attacking them physically, all they are doing is saying mean things. But there are just as many if not more people saying mean things about them. And both sides have that right. Your right to decide you are trans and to speak out against those who feel you don't is just as protected an act. Law and rights must be impartial in their creation to avoid even more inequality than already exists. \n\nNo one can validate your feelings and self other than you. You are justified in feeling how you feel, because that is how you feel. No one can decide that other than you. But remember that if disagreement is enough to make you lose respect for someone, then you'll never respect anyone because we all disagree on things we feel are important. So just take a breather and remember she is your mother, and if she loves you for who you are, nothing she defends or is against will affect that. And nothing from the conversation you present shows she would be okay with people killing you or liking that they hate you. She is simply saying folks got rights to not like people and be vocal about it. But she also points out you can do so at work, but may get fired for it. As for disrespecting troops and the country, no song or act of standing makes you patriotic. Neither does being a soldier. A soldier in today's military is there as a job. He isn't fighting for the direct freedom or sake of America. What makes one a patriot is defending your nation and calling out your nation when things are good or bad. So in a way, your argument with your mother was an act of patriotism on both sides. No those jerks who preach hate, they are using their right, but they are not patriots. Those who protest a certain thing, are just people who might want to be a patriot. \n\nI say go hug your mother, and tell her you may disagree, but love is what matters.

Her best friend and a close friend of mine, Becca, came from out of town to celebrate. Prior to the weekend, the guys in our friend group expressed their excitement about seeing Becca for the first time in a while, notably Caleb. He\u2019s probably the guy that\u2019s closest with all the girls in our group compared to everyone else.\n\nAt the pregame on Friday (10 PM), I was part of a conversation including Alexa and Caleb in which Becca was gushing about her soon-to-be-boyfriend . At the bar later, Becca told me in the bathroom after a few more drinks that a friend of her\u2019s from college had met Caleb on a birthright trip that summer and had regretted NOT hooking up with him because a lot of girls did and enjoyed themselves. As the night went on, Caleb and Becca (and some others) got blacked out. One of the other girls and I went home earlier than everyone else and we met up for lunch the next day.\n\nAt lunch, Becca tells Alexa, my friend and I, that she made out with Caleb at some point the night before. We were all pretty surprised considering how close our friend group is and the fact that Becca had shared she was dating someone the night before. Saturday night was more tame, and Becca mentioned at the end of the night that there was some awkward interactions with Caleb. She left Sunday and nothing more was said.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Caleb and I talked at length about the weekend. He told me this - he was blacked out most of the evening at bars and one of his friends witnessed him and Becca making out publicly. He did not remember this. At the end of the night (1AM), Alexa, Becca and Caleb all took an uber home together. Alexa and Caleb live a 5 minute walk from each other. When Caleb got out of the uber, Becca did too and Alexa (being pretty drunk) didn\u2019t question and and wanted to get home so she could throw up in the comfort of her own bathroom. Caleb then tells me that him and Becca smoked weed for a longtime and \u2018hooked up\u2019, implying either oral or penetrative sex. Surprised to learn this, I asked him if he remembered Becca talking about her boyfriend and he did not, and was definitely shocked. He asked me if he should text her to apologize and told him not to, under the impression that Becca had not shared that she went home with Caleb because she didn't want me to know.\n\nA week later, I hung out with Alexa and straight out asked her why Becca had not told us she had gone home with Caleb. Alexa then told me that Becca had no memory of the entirety of Friday night. The only reason she shared they had made out at the bars is because she vaguely remembered his face being close to hers, not even positive that it had happened. Alexa said she woke up when Becca came home at 5AM, checked her phone and then went to bed. Becca was at Caleb's for about four hours.\n\nI would have never, ever thought Caleb (my closest guy friend) would do something like acquaintance rape or find himself in this situation so I'm pretty frazzled. Becca, while being a close friend of mine, keeps herself at a distance and I don't keep in touch with her much when she's not here. An awful, small part of me thinks she wasn't blacked out the whole night but claimed she was in order to save face because she didn't want to admit that she had essentially cheated on her boyfriend (they became official the next week). But overall, I do believe she doesn't remember the night. Alexa didn't really want to talk about it at length and I feel awkward about contacting Becca about this when we don't talk if we're not together in person.

I developed a cold sweat and no position relieved my level 8 pain. I went to the bathroom because it felt like I needed to and I just laid on the cold floor for a good bit. After I dragged myself to my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s room and I said, \u201cHospital.\u201d     \n\u201cYou sure?\u201d     \n\u201cNo.\u201d *wave of pain* \u201cYes.\u201d     \n\nI contacted my parents about it because they love me and only want what\u2019s best for me.

I have not been kicked out for being queer, atheist, trans, or liberal, so I know it definitely could have been worse. My father also believes that one should wait until marriage for sex and that abortion is murder (though he wouldn\u2019t kick me out for it), but he makes exceptions for rape, threatening the pregnant person, etc. My mother is all of this but somewhat toned down.\n\nMy parents were not on my HIPPA form (I\u2019d been to the facility before) but the doctor just told me I was pregnant *while my dad was in the room.* Luckily my parents *love* my fianc\u00e9e and just want me to be healthy and alive (the pregnancy is ectopic, IUD). They even support me if I get sterilized during the surgery, which I\u2019ve wanted since I was 16 (23 on 9/27). I\u2019m still angry at the doctor for breaking my HIPPA but I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to make up some story to feed my parents, and learned they\u2019d be okay with sterilization.\n\nSo now I\u2019m waiting to be transferred to my OB/GYN where I\u2019m going to try to talk him into sterilization while he\u2019s messin with all my internal reproductive bits.\n\nTL;DR, doc told me about my ectopic pregnancy while my moderate conservative-Christian  father was in the room, ended up supporting me instead of chastising as I had expected.\n\nUPDATE: My actual gyno thinks it\u2019s a miscarriage, so we\u2019ll be monitoring my hormone levels over the next 48 hours to see if I am, if I\u2019m still having a uterine pregnancy, or if it\u2019s ectopic.", "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "over_18": true, "submission_time": "Mon Sep 25 15:20:30 2017", "id": "72brjw", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 168817, "gilded": 0, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "This is... maybe not quite clickbait, but related.\n\nReally, white nationalism is a man's game.

I'm not sure if this is just me being self centered or if this is actually a problem so I'm hoping to hear what you all think. Something I  routinely notice in the family unit is how little the woman seems to matter. Meaning she isn't to be considered in how she feels except, for the most part, during her wedding and when she's pregnant. Maybe it's just because I'm from the south but it's like any other time beyond that ones a woman is married and has children she's not supposed to have anything she really needs, and if she tried to assert those needs she's a harpy bitch.  Something I see a lot of is if something happens to the husband the only thought seems to be \"Oh what about the children.\" No one cares much if he had a partner left behind or how it will effect her. Of course the children are of much concern and the mother should try to be as strong as she can for them. But what about how her own life is effected?\n\n* I guess my point is, is this self centered? Or is the woman in the picture always expected to basically nut up and shut up about her own needs once she's married or had kids? \n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who replied. To be more specific, I'm mainly talking about the pressure coming from other women. And I guess to be fair I was raised in a fairly toxic environment. No, not all of the south is bad, but there are plenty of places heavily influenced by religion where woman eat last and aren't aloud to pray etc.. No man has ever called me a harpy bitch, but my SO's side of the family thinks I'm Satan for wanting time with him without the little one and those words have floated around from them. And my side of the family doesn't say much but it's unheard of to take time to themselves without it being forced on them. It just feels like if I set boundaries and try to take I'm being selfish.

She is an art fanatic, does art work herself.\n\nI have a friend who does amazing drawings, and I\u2019d like to ask him to do a drawing of her based on some profile pictures I could provide. My art skills frankly suck, otherwise I\u2019d obviously do myself. \n\nSo really my question is, would you find that weird getting that as a gift?...considering I didn\u2019t do it myself?\n\nShould note that she is really into me, so it\u2019s not a strange  \u201cout of the blue\u201d type of thing.

But at a bar when we sat down, my close male friend put his hand under my butt.  At first I thought I had accidentally sat on it so I moved. But then he did it again.  His girlfriend was sitting on the other side of him. To be honest I kind of froze up when I started to realise it might be intentional.  His gf is my friend too.  So I got up to talk to another friend to get away from him.  But then he beckoned me over again to ask a question.  Since he did this in front of everyone I didn't know how to say no without it looking suspicious so I went over to him.  It was loud so he told me to sit down.  Then he did it again.  He put his hand underneath me and felt me up.  I was wearing shorts so he was mainly touching my ass but I was so uncomfortable.  But  I didn't say anything.  I just tried moving away.  This same kind of thing happened about 4 times over the night.  \n\nAfterwards, when I got home I called one of our friends. He was shocked because this friend of ours is usually such a respectful, loyal guy.  My friend said I should've spoken up and asked what he was doing when he first touched me.  Actually, I know this is true, I should've, but I just froze and didn't want to cause a scene with his gf there. I didn't want to be 'that girl' that got between a couple.  I just didn't know what to do. I then called another friend because I was upset.  His first response was 'yes I would feel guilty too'.  But I never mentioned feeling guilty. I think I was feeling upset.  He said 'well I think you didn't do too much wrong, but if you tell the gf she might get angry at you, because after all you did go back to him, so what can you say to that? ' \n\nAnd that's true.  I did go back to sit down with him.  I just didn't know what to do.  So I feel a bunch of emotions and I don't know how to sort them out right now.  I feel something like upset, betrayed, helpless, that my close friend touched me.  I feel sad that I didn't do the right thing.
