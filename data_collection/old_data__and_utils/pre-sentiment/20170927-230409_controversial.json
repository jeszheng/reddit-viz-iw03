It's important to distinguish between sex chromosomes, sexual orientation and gender identity.The \"natural\" norm of sexual dimorphism is:* Genotype XY produces a male body with a brain that \"feels\" phenotype male and is attracted to XX women* Genotype XX produces a female body with a brain that \"feels' phenotype female and is attracted to XY menSex chromosomes determine the genetic sex, but they definitely are not directly responsible for the formation of the brain. This happens under the influence of hormones, environmental factors, life experiences, siblings/family dynamics various genes and the circumstances in the womb during the pregnancy. This means that there are deviations from the norm when it comes to sexual orientation and gender identity and a bunch of other traits that make a human being. There is some evidence that gay men possess areas of the brain that very closely resemble those same areas of straight women.Because nature doesn't deal in absolute black and white dichotomies, there is always overlap. This is why men have nipples. We all start as a relatively identical atavistic blueprint which differentiates a lot after those first few cell divisions. All conception really determines is the sex chromosomes that mediate among other things testosterone/estrogen hormone expression and sensitivity. There's plenty of variation in those things between straight \"cis\" people too.Because of the deviations, different combinations are possible. Just as men can be straight, bi or gay, men can identify as women. To say being (it's more than a feeling really. It's a feeling as in the position of your arms and legs is a feeling) transgender is a mental illness isn't medically incorrect. That just means that homosexuality is a mental illness too.edit: the people who distort this to mean that people can choose fictional genders they invent themselves or that they can freely claim to identify as a lamp post can choke on a gender neutral dick for muddying the waters of an already divisive issue", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 74033, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 17:21:35 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "I don't.

Those people are easy to ignore because they're just projecting.However, there's also transtrenderism, which is people who think the formula can work backwards. Aka, \"I feel like identifying as the other gender, therefore I am transgender, and if you don't allow us to command you to call us this or that then we're taking legal action.

Many might not want an MtF girlfriend or FtM boyfriend, because on some level it's just not quite the same thing, but in general there's no problem. But a lot of people have a problem with transtrenders. Because they take away the legitimacy of real transgendered people, are overall illogical, quite authoritarian in their demands to control what people can and cannot say (or even think), often obnoxiously condescending, don't believe genders are binary (essentially defining gender as personality), they don't feel or seem or hint strongly enough that they are the other gender, but demand to be recognized as such.

This event, [GW170814](https://dcc.ligo.org/P170814/public) is similar to the three events seen before. The black hole masses are in the 20-30 solar mass range. The remarkable thing today is that this event was seen with 3 detectors. Past events had all been seen with just the two LIGO detectors, in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA. This event was *also* seen by the European VIRGO detector. So why is this important? First, it allows you to make measurements of gravitational wave polarization. Just like light, gravitational waves can be polarized. The detectors are slightly tilted with respect to each other, allowing us to resolve 'more' of the signal, essentially. Additionally, the three detectors allow us to localize the event far better than before. This means we know what direction in the sky it happened. For past detections, events were [localized to a ring](http://www.ligo.org/images/faq-localization-comparison.jpg). We get this by knowing that gravitatoinal waves move at the speed of light, so if the signal arrives slightly earlier at one detector, we can localize it to a ring in space. With three detectors/detections, you can do proper triangulation. This has made the localization 20x more accurate ([see Fig 3](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P170814/public/main)). See [a comparison of the localization of all 4 events here.](https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/913090863164645376)Improvements in localization will be necessary for studying new gravitational wave sources, such as neutron star mergers. Gravitational wave detectors are passive. They just sit and wait, and will detect any event that's loud enough, no matter the direction. That's fine for black hole mergers, because they're 'dark' events so you don't expect a big explosion to accompany it. In contrast, a neutron star merger would produce a wealth of electromagnetic signals. If LIGO observes a neutron star merger, and then can localize it well, it becomes possible to do electromagnetic followup observations quickly, giving us more detailed information about how the merger occurs and evolves.

No particular reason why.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy) states astronomical spectroscopy dates back to the (rather unhelpful) \"early 1800s\", but states that there were retail devices available by at least 1884. Of course, it also took awhile for spectrographic lines to be made sense of and mapped. To begin with, it informed us more about the nature of light and matter itself, than the planets or sun. So... hopefully 1884 is just as good as any other date.So, if we look at a [timeline for astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy) and work backwards from 1884... Well, aside from spectroscopy, there's not a whole lot.* 1846, Neptune is credited to Johann Gottfried Galle, but there's evidence Galileo may have discovered it.* 1801 an asteroid is discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi and demonstrated by William Herschel.* 1781 Uranus is discovered by William Herschel (busy guy!).etc.Doesn't help as much as I thought....

Voting, as a minority, for your own demographic is tempting because there's a perception of shared life experience. A white man never grew up black.

They can be sympathetic, but they never felt what it was like to choose between rent and food.The worst thing about the so called SJW movement is that mistakes dialog for racism and bigotry.

Part of its campaign to vilify Hillary Clinton involved catering to her rivals on the far-left and pushing any number of crankish conspiracy theories that appeal as much to \u201canti-imperialists\u201d as to neo-Nazis.___>In December 2015, the Kremlin feted Stein by inviting her to the gala celebrating the 10-year anniversary of Kremlin-funded propaganda network RT. Over a year later, it remains unclear who paid for Stein\u2019s trip to Moscow and her accommodations there. Her campaign ignored multiple questions on this score. We do know, however, that Stein sat at the same table as both Putin and Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Trump\u2019s soon-to-be national security adviser. She further spoke at an RT-sponsored panel, using her presence to criticize the U.S.\u2019s \u201cdisastrous militarism.\u201d Afterward, straddling Moscow\u2019s Red Square, Stein described the panel as \u201cinspiring,\u201d going on to claim that Putin, whom she painted as a political novice, told her he \u201cagree[d]\u201d with her \u201con many issues.\u201d___>Indeed, her pro-Kremlin stance wasn\u2019t limited to merely praising Putin\u2019s amicability. Stein joined the Russian president and Kazakhstani dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev in describing Ukraine\u2019s 2014 EuroMaidan revolution as a \u201ccoup,\u201d and claimed, bizarrely, that NATO is currently \u201cfighting\u2026 enemies we invent to give the weapons industry a reason to sell more stuff.\u201d>For good measure, she also asserted in September that \u201cRussia used to own Ukraine,\u201d by way of defending its colonization. She even selected a vice-presidential candidate who, when asked whether the downing of Flight MH17\u2014a massacre almost certainly caused by Russian-supplied separatists in eastern Ukraine\u2014was a false flag, responded, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s exactly what has happened.___>There\u2019s a reason, after all, that Kremlin-funded Sputnik hosts podcasts by Americans who claim \u201cprogressive\u201d viewpoints\u2014at least when it comes to altering the exclusively domestic landscape in America. Nor are these fake news outlets tilling fallow soil.>Consider one of the flagship magazines of the American left, which, for all its support of gay rights, government transparency, and voting rights as they pertain to U.S. society, has developed a notoriously soft spot for a regime that violently opposes all of the above.>The Nation\u2019s coverage of Russian affairs is a national embarrassment. RT is a website that hosts neo-Nazis as \u201cexpert\u201d commentators. Yet that does not stop The Nation from publishing whataboutist articles in defense of the propaganda channel; articles pushing the same argument, with the exact same headlines, as those found in white-nationalist publications.___>When I pointed out that one of The Nation\u2019s contributing writers, former J.P. Morgan banker James Carden, now executive editor of the American Committee for East-West Accord\u2014an organization partly funded by vanden Heuvel\u2019s family\u2014continues to contribute to Kremlin-funded Russia Direct, what I received was nothing short of a deranged ad hominem. Carden, who appeared on RT a few weeks ago to claim that The Washington Post is pursuing a \u201cproject of promoting a new Cold War with the Russian Federation,\u201d sent me a note on LinkedIn calling me a \u201csniveling shit,\u201d and vaguely (if unintentionally hilariously) threatening me with physical violence, demanding to see if I was \u201cbrave as BATMAN [sic]\u201d in person. He later apologized.___>In a few swing states, after all, Clinton lost to Trump by a margin smaller than Stein\u2019s total statewide voter haul. The Nation has tens of thousands of subscribers and a venerable, 150-year-old pedigree for liberal advocacy. The WikiLeaked DNC and John Podesta emails, meanwhile, gradually released during and after the Democratic National Convention in August, did untold damage to Clinton\u2019s campaign. ___>But the American left has just as much reason to take stock. Ideologically promiscuous and unbound by the orthodoxies of a single party or historical narrative, Putin has cultivated dupes, fellow travelers, and purblind fools among plenty of American progressives who, whether by accident or design, have facilitated the rise of the most extremist and reactionary president this country has ever elected.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 34457, "stickied": false, "score": 13, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 18:59:25 2017", "ups": 13}, {"body": "**It's interesting to look at who said the primary wasn't rigged:**[The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-democratic-primary-wasnt-rigged/)[ForwardProgressives](http://forwardprogressives.com/for-the-last-time-heres-proof-the-democratic-primary-wasnt-rigged-against-bernie-sanders/)[The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/135472/no-dnc-didnt-rig-primary-favor-hillary)[538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-system-isnt-rigged-against-sanders/)[Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/06/some-closing-thoughts-democratic-primary)[Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/07/25/the_dnc_s_emails_show_it_had_no_idea_how_to_rig_an_election.html)[Bernie Sanders' campaign staff](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/tweetstorm-bernie-sanders-former-press-secretary-amazing)and[Bernie Sanders](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/281619-sanders-primary-isnt-rigged-just-dumb)&nbsp;**And who was pushing all those stories about it being rigged:**[Brietbart](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/17/rigged-system-hacked-dnc-document-shows-bernie-sanders-never-stood-chance-hillary-clinton/) ^[2](http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/05/rigged-system-hillary-had-agreement-preventing-bernie-from-criticizing-her/) ^[3](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/10/25/full-text-the-election-is-rigged-by-milo/) ^[4](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/17/rigged-system-hacked-dnc-document-shows-bernie-sanders-never-stood-chance-hillary-clinton/) ^[5](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/15/hillary-clinton-illegitimate-nomination/)[The New York Post](http://nypost.com/2016/07/22/leaked-emails-show-how-democrats-screwed-sanders/) ^[2](http://nypost.com/2016/06/16/leaked-document-shows-the-dnc-wanted-clinton-from-start/) ^[3](http://nypost.com/2016/04/09/bernie-sanders-wins-democratic-caucuses-in-wyoming/) ^[4](http://nypost.com/2016/06/22/sanders-backers-lose-their-cool-at-democratic-party-meeting/)[Russia Today](https://www.rt.com/usa/352934-trump-sanders-wikileaks-dnc/) ^[2](https://www.rt.com/usa/356067-wasserman-schultz-boasts-clinton/) ^[3](https://www.rt.com/usa/352752-dnc-leaks-clinton-collusion/) ^[4](https://www.rt.com/usa/349277-sanders-lawsuit-wasserman-schultz/) ^[5](https://www.rt.com/usa/350966-voter-suppression-sanders-supporter-hustled/) ^[6](https://www.rt.com/usa/365219-podesta-emails-clinton-wikileaks/)&nbsp;^and ^of ^course[Donald Trump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/732148805118885889)  ^[2](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/756804886038192128) ^[3](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/756801575193042944) ^[4](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/756798838900396032) ^[5](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/757690132111777792) ^[6](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/757336511436075008) ^[7](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/757191160481873920)", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 28667, "stickied": false, "score": 8, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 19:09:27 2017", "ups": 8}, {"body": "Regular American citizen from America here.

Feminism pays lipservice to such problems, stating that the patriarchy affects all sexes and genders adversely, and by abolishing patriarchy these problems will be solved.Sadly, the problems aren't as simple as this, and while attention should be paid to female problems and issues, there should be some consideration given towards mens issues as well- for society to become equal both genders must be liberated. Feminism has a bad history of either ignoring mens issues or actively detracting from them (shutting down domestic violence shelters for men, harassing the supporters of mens rights, even when non-sexist, shutting down conferences around mens issues via protests and fire alarms).

I had issues with getting along with both guys and girls as a teenager, but now as an adult, It's next to impossible for me to make friends with other women. On the other hand, I only attract strange older men for friends (some who obviously want to be more than just friends). I've only had three male friends who didn't want to sleep with me, and I had to cut one off because even though I showed obvious signs that I wasn't interested, he would still try to have romantic relationships with me. Just recently at my new job, the middle aged male janitor always kept on trying to hit on me . Also, when I was acting polite to another middle aged black man (I'm a black woman), he took it the wrong way and believed that I was romantically interested. This is why I hate being too nice to guys now. Even at my old warehouse job, I was treated like an object, just like you. It's tiring and I remember having to complain to HR 3 times about it. You also should have never talked to a male therapist about this problem in the first place, because some men can be biased regarding women complaining about the attention (then again to be fair, some women act like this too). They believe that women are entitled to enjoy being treated like objects by other men and that we should \"stop complaining.\"My advice is to ignore creepy men who treat you like objects and use your beauty to an advantage, like Instagram modeling. Men would be attracted to anything that moves, and won't give a damn if you have mental disorders. They're desperate. When it comes to relating with other women, a good advice is to try and befriend other women who look just as good as you do or even better. you should also befriend women who are on your level academically and financially to avoid competition. This would also help get men to stop paying so much attention to you and treating you like an object rather than a human being.

On the other hand, I only attract strange older men for friends (some who obviously want to be more than just friends). I've only had three male friends who didn't want to sleep with me, and I had to cut one off because even though I showed obvious signs that I wasn't interested, he would still try to have romantic relationships with me.

Men would be attracted to anything that moves, and won't give a damn if you have mental disorders. They're desperate. When it comes to relating with other women, a good advice is to try and befriend other women who look just as good as you do or even better. you should also befriend women who are on your level academically and financially to avoid competition.

I haven't been without a boyfriend for five minutes since I was 12 and I've had loads of male friendships end because men tried to Nice Guy me or outright tried to get sex (even when they were married). This has less to do with you being hot and more to do with you being a woman in a society where men are permitted and almost expected to treat women as sex objects/romantic partners and can't acknowledge women's autonomy and desires as separate from their own. The fact that you are hot may make it happen more, but being even okay looking will get this sort of attention (and honestly I'm guessing plenty of women who subjectively consider themselves unattractive also get this attention, just less than someone like yourself). On top of this, as others have probably mentioned, some men are intimidated by very attractive women and more likely to hit on someone more average looking they think will be \"grateful\" for the attention. Thus the old cliche of guys who are turned down by a girl getting angry and telling her she's \"not that hot anyway.\" Because basically she was a \"good enough\" conquest he thought would be easy and not someone he found super attractive, as he believes a super attractive woman would shoot him down instantly. There's also a ton of studies that show the myriad ways people receive \"pretty privilege\" for being attractive - if you were \"ugly\" you would most likely be lamenting how people don't pay attention to you, you have a harder time finding mates, you're always treated as the \"friend\" and never considered as a romantic partner, etc etc cliche cliche. As another user said, the grass is always greener. As someone who went from a size six to a size 18/20 I can tell you first hand you are treated better in a whole host of ways by other people for being more in the range of \"attractive\" by society's standards. The less you fit in the box of an acceptable appearance/size the more invisible you become and some people even treat you with open disdain. Mind you, I still considered myself a cute fat girl - I got hit on still and I met my current bf of six years while still overweight. But now that I'm back down to a size 8, it's really driven home how differently people, especially men, treat me now than when I was fat. I also notice how blatantly better they treat me versus a friend if they are overweight or more \"plain\" looking just as I see how quick they are to ignore me if I'm with a friend who is thinner/hotter. Being attractive, overall, is a boon in a society that heavily values attractiveness and inherently has many positive biases towards people who are good looking. So to be blunt, don't fool yourself being hot is worse than being ugly/average in our society. It's not.

For months she didn't work and she has become financially dependent on him. Over the past year and a half he has gone through her phone, Facebook, and email asking questions like \"who is this guy?\" or more troubling \"why do you have emails from your ex?\" (it is important to note here that these emails were written over a year before they even met) He has told her that it makes him uncomfortable that she has conversations with her male coworkers and doesn't tell him about them.

(TMI and I am sorry ahead of time) When I got pregnant I started getting the runs. All the time, multiple times a day. Sometimes with no warning which makes it hard to do everyday things. It effects my work and home life as sometimes I have to spend 30 mins in the bathroom. It can be very painful and I feel like I have to throw up at the same time as having the runs. This has been going on for upwards of 2 years now. I have an apt next week with a G.I. specialist but I am wondering if a few of these issues could be tied together with this one. 2. My second issue... Sex has been painful after the birth of my first child. Some times a sharp pain and sometimes just an uncomfortable feeling but always something. Sometimes I feel like he's in my bum when I know he isn't, the pressure just feels so intense. This makes things difficult as I can't enjoy sex with my husband anymore. Has this happened with anyone else since having a child?3. Lastly I have never in my life had an orgasm. I don't enjoy playing with myself or being played with by anyone else. It makes me feel uncomfortable and sometimes it makes me cry. I just really can't handle the feeling I get when there is too much stimulation. I think that region is very sensitive to touch as I have not really played with it over the years. The only way I play with myself is more of a blanket grinding thing that I have done for the last 7 years or so. I lay on my tummy and just grind on a blanket as if I am having sex, with all my clothes on. I don't have an orgasm but I know when I am done. Its hard to explain really. I am wondering if this could be purely physical or maybe a physiological issue as I have been raped multiple times, the first of which was when I was a virgin at 16.  I was reading the rules and I know it said something about not asking for medical advice. I am not asking for medical advise but rather who I should go to in order to get help with these issues. would these things be for a G.I doctor or an OBGYM or both? These things are frustrating and are effecting my personal life. I am not sure really where else to go. any advise would be helpful.

I am tired of being treated lesser by fellow women who have kids. I am tired to being told I have free time because I am not a mother. I am tired of being told I can't ever understand.    And before I start this story I KNOW being a mother is hard, I know that it is difficult, and I am currently trying to get pregnant, but I am confused about this message that people who have kids just cant preform at the same level as those who dont have kids.     I am a female college professor at a teaching university (not research). I love being in the classroom, I don't mind serving on committees, and I work hard. I publish, I participate, and I am good at my job. However, after working here for one full year I now realize that I am being asked to do jobs that others are not because I don't have kids. For example \"donthavekidsmustwork, YOU can come in on a weekend to do recruitment, scheduling etc because the rest of us have kids and events, so you can do it, right?\" Sometimes it's not that blatant, but sometimes it really is.      Most recently a reviewer was here for our five-year departmental review and I was at dinner with the reviewer and my chair (my chair is female. Furthermore, I was told I was chosen as I did not have a family and could make the dinner; whereas the person who VOLUNTEERED was told not to worry about it, as she has a family she needs to attend to).  I had to sit through a discussion between the reviewer and the chair where they discussed that no one can really understand how difficult it is to be a mother until they are a mother. My chair then went on to say that all the women at my university without kids should/are the ones who take on important roles because they can, because they aren't busy, because they don't have other more important things to do. She was specifically talking about a lesbian co-worker who does not have a family and is, indeed, dedicated to her job, but I don't see that as being she has family and cant do it vs not having a family and can. I was just blown away that these two women were sitting there saying that women cant be strong and excellent contributors because they have a family.   Maybe I am just sensitive as I am trying to get pregnant. Maybe I am sensitive because I am one of two junior faculty in a seven faculty department. Maybe I am just sensitive because I am the only faculty member without kids yet. But, I have begun to find myself sitting in meetings and engagements silent as my fellow co-workers continually discuss the hardships of parents and feeling- not just left out- but at a loss.       I hope that when and if I am lucky enough to have kids I will remind myself to be mindful of those around me and their life experiences and meet them where they are at.   I have been thinking about this a lot and I just need to know, am I looking at this all wrong? Do I REALLY, REALLY not know what it's like? Can I not appreciate the hardships, but also think that people with families can achieve highly? Apologies for the rant and the questions, I have been carrying this around for a while.

This is my first time posting, so I apologize for poor formatting. I'm a female in my late twenties who has been seeing a man in his late fifties for a few years now.  I could not be happier.  We are more adventurous than teenagers--we're both pilots and we own three boats--and we have a very healthy mutual love and respect for each other.  He claims I'm a female version of him, and while they say \"opposites attract,\" we say, \"likes are inseparable!\"I never imagined settling down with anyone more than a few years different in age, as I've always wanted a family and children to share my love of life with.  However, I don't think I could ever replicate the feelings and relationship I have with my boyfriend now, and I fear trying.  My boyfriend lost his only son a decade ago, and he says he was \"at his best\" when his son was alive and that it would be a gift from God if he ever could have another child.  According to his friends and family, he was an excellent, enthusiastic father, and I believe his capacity to love and adore a child in light of the loss is unimaginably great.  As our relationship grows increasingly serious, he is leaving the decision up to me: if I want children, he'd be over the moon.  If I don't, absolutely fine. My personal opinion has always been that it is more important for a child to be born into a home with an abundance of love than to \"perfect\" parents.  Obviously, I am young and expect to be energetic and healthy for many years.  My boyfriend, although young at heart and often wilder than I am, will be an older father. I mentioned these deliberations to a friend, and she believes it's \"unbelievably selfish\" for anyone to have a child at my boyfriend's age.   The last thing I want to do is set up a kid for heartache willfully.  Has anyone had experience as either a parent or child in this situation?  Our intentions are pure, but I worry that our judgement is tainted by emotion.Thanks so much to all who read my ramblings!  You all have a very neat community here.

I remember seeing her often and probably the most troublesome part was caring for the stitches (and using a very ugly, huge bra lol), since they would often stick to the gauze when she didn't cover it with medicine properly. That also includes not being able to lift your arms above your shoulder height for a while to not risk ripping the skin while it heals. So it was uncomfortable to shower, get dressed and sleep mostly, but she got back to her daily life after a week of resting even with all the limitations. The whole healing process took about two to three months. You can barely see her scars since they're right next to the \"underboob\" line, it was very well done!  I'm not in the US, so I'm not sure how the insurance experience would apply... But she had the doctor convince her healthcare company that it was a threat to her health so they covered it. To clarify, it's not easy to get healthcare (that you pay monthly) to cover this sort of procedures here.

Or he would criticize my personality until he felt on top again. He would go into long, dragged-out take downs of my personality and everything that is wrong with me \"because he loves me and he wants to help me improve\" and \"self-improvement is the most important thing to him in a partner\", but flat out shut down conversation every time I wanted to point something out to him.

He would yell at me for trivial things and then say that nobody makes him lose his shit like I do, there's something seriously wrong with me. When I had conflicts with people, he would reliably take sides with the other party. He seemed especially happy when I was crying, patting me on the back, feeling in his element. I have become more anxious and full of self-doubt as a result of listening to him. Seriously, fuck that noise. But it still hurts. I'm still awake at night thinking about things. I'm thinking about this more than my actual problems at work and such that could really improve my career. Really trivial things like how do I tell him that it's over? I'm angry at him for taking too much mental bandwidth in my mind. I want him gone from my mind. And then there's the gnawing doubt that maybe if I could just get him to listen and understand how this makes me feel, we could be alright. On the other hand, letting him go makes me feel like I can finally breathe again. He is moving out, but it may take a while. Maybe months.

In his latest statement to this effect, the American leader stressed that his country was fully prepared for a military solution to the crisis on the Korean peninsula. These threats, however, did not have a soothing effect. According to South Korean sources, in the very near future Pyongyang can again test a thermonuclear bomb. And if this does not happen before the end of September, then in the beginning of October the world should prepare for the next North Korean test - missile or nuclear.North Korea ready to blow up a hydrogen bomb photo: ru.wikipedia.orgSpeaking about the North Korean problem, Trump noted that the military way to solve it is not preferable. However, the US has every opportunity to realize this scenario, the American leader stressed.Some sources in South Korea, in turn, said that their northern neighbors in the very near future will conduct a new test.It is worth noting that the data of the South Korean media about the DPRK often do not correspond to reality. One can recall the countless news from Seoul about how Kim Jong-un allegedly shot his colleagues and relatives from a grenade launcher, gave away dogs to tearing, etc. Although the North Korean regime did not gain the glory of the most humane in the world, so odious reports as rule, no confirmation was found. The Korean experts agree that in South Korea they are trying their best to demonize the neighbors' regime in order to justify a possible strike against Pyongyang. The scenario of this, by the way, regularly sharpens on joint US-South Korean exercises.Nevertheless, the threat of a new test on the part of the DPRK is quite real. In 2017, Pyongyang conducted not only a series of rocket launches (including the launch of an intercontinental missile), but also tested a hydrogen (thermonuclear) bomb on September 3. It is assured in North Korea that it can be placed on a launch vehicle. Pyongyang reported about a successful thermonuclear test in 2016, but then experts doubted the received data, finding the DPRK statements bravado. The test in September this year almost left experts doubt: North Korea has a hydrogen weapon, and, according to Kim Jong-no, is ready to apply it. Following the very emotional speech of Donald Trump at the UN General Assembly, in which the US president promised to destroy the DPRK, the North Korean leader made a personal statement. Not only did he not hesitate in expressing Trump, but he also promised to \"tame him with fire,\" taking \"such countermeasures that the world had not yet seen.\"In the tradition of the North Korean regime - the timing of important military trials to the landmark dates from the history of the country. In just two weeks, on October 10, the DPRK will mark the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the Korean Workers' Party. And, according to foreign analysts, given the recent \"exchange of courtesies\" between Trump and Kim Jong-no, the launch of a missile or a bomb explosion is inevitable.However, the last word on the road to a real war, obviously, after all, is the American leader. North Korean authorities, despite the fact that they constantly raise the degree of tension, can not fail to understand: the military conflict, of course, will strike their opponents, but the regime itself will fall in the DPRK. Therefore, experts in the threats of Kim Jong-un often see a veiled appeal for negotiations - or blackmail, which does not change the essence. Trump, who can not yet boast of successes in domestic politics-almost all his initiatives are stalled, he never found contact with the congressmen-he needs the notorious \"small victorious war.\" The hope that these plans will not come true, is given by the famous American system of \"checks and balances\". Although the US Congress also does not feel sympathy for the regime of Kim Jong-un, while on the Capitol Hill they prefer to limit themselves to sanctions.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 39, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 05:42:43 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Huh?

In his latest statement to this effect, the American leader stressed that his country was fully prepared for a military solution to the crisis on the Korean peninsula. These threats, however, did not have a soothing effect. According to South Korean sources, in the very near future Pyongyang can again test a thermonuclear bomb. And if this does not happen before the end of September, then in the beginning of October the world should prepare for the next North Korean test - missile or nuclear.North Korea ready to blow up a hydrogen bomb photo: ru.wikipedia.orgSpeaking about the North Korean problem, Trump noted that the military way to solve it is not preferable. However, the US has every opportunity to realize this scenario, the American leader stressed.Some sources in South Korea, in turn, said that their northern neighbors in the very near future will conduct a new test.It is worth noting that the data of the South Korean media about the DPRK often do not correspond to reality. One can recall the countless news from Seoul about how Kim Jong-un allegedly shot his colleagues and relatives from a grenade launcher, gave away dogs to tearing, etc. Although the North Korean regime did not gain the glory of the most humane in the world, so odious reports as rule, no confirmation was found. The Korean experts agree that in South Korea they are trying their best to demonize the neighbors' regime in order to justify a possible strike against Pyongyang. The scenario of this, by the way, regularly sharpens on joint US-South Korean exercises.Nevertheless, the threat of a new test on the part of the DPRK is quite real. In 2017, Pyongyang conducted not only a series of rocket launches (including the launch of an intercontinental missile), but also tested a hydrogen (thermonuclear) bomb on September 3. It is assured in North Korea that it can be placed on a launch vehicle. Pyongyang reported about a successful thermonuclear test in 2016, but then experts doubted the received data, finding the DPRK statements bravado. The test in September this year almost left experts doubt: North Korea has a hydrogen weapon, and, according to Kim Jong-no, is ready to apply it. Following the very emotional speech of Donald Trump at the UN General Assembly, in which the US president promised to destroy the DPRK, the North Korean leader made a personal statement. Not only did he not hesitate in expressing Trump, but he also promised to \"tame him with fire,\" taking \"such countermeasures that the world had not yet seen.\"In the tradition of the North Korean regime - the timing of important military trials to the landmark dates from the history of the country. In just two weeks, on October 10, the DPRK will mark the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the Korean Workers' Party. And, according to foreign analysts, given the recent \"exchange of courtesies\" between Trump and Kim Jong-no, the launch of a missile or a bomb explosion is inevitable.However, the last word on the road to a real war, obviously, after all, is the American leader. North Korean authorities, despite the fact that they constantly raise the degree of tension, can not fail to understand: the military conflict, of course, will strike their opponents, but the regime itself will fall in the DPRK. Therefore, experts in the threats of Kim Jong-un often see a veiled appeal for negotiations - or blackmail, which does not change the essence. Trump, who can not yet boast of successes in domestic politics-almost all his initiatives are stalled, he never found contact with the congressmen-he needs the notorious \"small victorious war.\" The hope that these plans will not come true, is given by the famous American system of \"checks and balances\". Although the US Congress also does not feel sympathy for the regime of Kim Jong-un, while on the Capitol Hill they prefer to limit themselves to sanctions.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 39, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 05:42:43 2017", "ups": 1}], "stickied": false, "title": "North Korea ready to blow up a hydrogen bomb", "url": "http://www.mk.ru/politics/2017/09/27/kndr-gotova-vzorvat-vodorodnuyu-bombu.html", "num_comments": 12, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 05:34:09 2017", "contest_mode": false, "subreddit": "worldnews", "pinned": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/72wx8g/north_korea_ready_to_blow_up_a_hydrogen_bomb/", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "over_18": false, "selftext": "", "id": "72wx8g", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 50688, "gilded": 0, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "We tried this before and then putin invaded crimea.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 2209, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Wed Sep 27 16:21:53 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "It's nice to see that even though the governments don't get along the citizens can.

I'm not going to say if I'm for or against what they are protesting.As employees of the NFL, they should conduct themselves as such. What they do on their own time is their business and can protest as they seem fit. Using the NFL stage as their platform, it is ethically wrong(from a business standpoint) to allow their employees to conduct themselves as such while at a game. This would be true for most businesses. If you protest at work, during working hours without approval can be means for dismissal. I think most rational people don't care which side of the fence these players are on but doing so while working/playing can be seen as using their influence to motivate a political issue. Now this whole controversy is hitting the NFL execs hard due to the declining fan base and ticket sales. Sure some stadiums are still sold out but the NFL is taking a financial hit because of all of this. Now the total magnitude of this hit won't be know until all of this blows over. The NFL is now stuck in a tricky spot. If they choose to punish these players they will anger one side of their fan base and if they choose nothing they anger the other side. It's a loose loose situation. Loss of revenue of any magnitude is not good for a business. They have to do something or they will keep loosing money. Most people don't want to get involved, but your tax revenue goes towards the NFL indirectly so everyone (if they want to admit it or not) has skin in the game.

I'm not going to say if I'm for or against what they are protesting.As employees of the NFL, they should conduct themselves as such. What they do on their own time is their business and can protest as they seem fit. Using the NFL stage as their platform, it is ethically wrong(from a business standpoint) to allow their employees to conduct themselves as such while at a game. This would be true for most businesses. If you protest at work, during working hours without approval can be means for dismissal. I think most rational people don't care which side of the fence these players are on but doing so while working/playing can be seen as using their influence to motivate a political issue. Now this whole controversy is hitting the NFL execs hard due to the declining fan base and ticket sales. Sure some stadiums are still sold out but the NFL is taking a financial hit because of all of this. Now the total magnitude of this hit won't be know until all of this blows over. The NFL is now stuck in a tricky spot. If they choose to punish these players they will anger one side of their fan base and if they choose nothing they anger the other side. It's a loose loose situation. Loss of revenue of any magnitude is not good for a business. They have to do something or they will keep loosing money. Most people don't want to get involved, but your tax revenue goes towards the NFL indirectly so everyone (if they want to admit it or not) has skin in the game.
