When you go to a grocery store, a library, the DMV, every person is out doing their own thing and everyone has equal value. When you go into a club, every woman there is hyperaware that this place is made exclusively to raise their status and value and to give them an ego boost. They're automatically on guard. They expect to be hit on. And they expect to reject a lot of guys in order to feel better.Picking up a girl in a club is pickup on Hard Mode. The women in clubs who tend to go home with guys are of two types:* 1 - Those who came there with a guy to begin with.* 2 - Those who received zero attention all night and take the first guy who hits on them at last call.

The feedback of fusion reactions releasing energy which increases temperatures and pressures, driving expansion, fighting against gravitational collapse is what keeps stars from being crunched down into electron or neutron degeneracy conditions (or forming black holes). It's true, however, that fusion reactions which release energy are often more likely than those that don't.The real problem though is achieving the necessary temperatures to overcome the repulsive forces (coulomb barrier) keeping heavier nuclei apart.

To fuse even higher elements requires even higher temperatures, otherwise the rate of fusion is very low, regardless of whether it releases energy or not. Also, in the highest temperature conditions in the core there isn't a lot of lower atomic number nuclei other than alpha particles, the \"fuel\" that might be used for fusing into higher elements gets used up by more probably reactions. Even though fusing two Nickel-56 nuclei together is *possible* in the core of a giant star, the rate of it happening will be negligible.But that's not the worst problem. The other problem is that as temperatures increase and it becomes possible to fuse heavier elements the temperature reaches a range where the thermal radiation becomes energetic enough to start ripping apart atoms in a process called photodisintegration. This makes it hard for heavier elements to survive, even if they are created. And as temperatures reach towards a range where the rate of fusion of nuclei beyond Iron is non-trivial the rate of photodisintegration also climbs, tearing apart nuclei (particularly the less stable nuclei) left and right. Meanwhile, in the short window of time while this is happening the star is heading toward death in a supernova explosion.It's the comparatively low temperature conditions of heavy neutron bombardment in the \"r-process\" (such as in Type II supernovae) where heavier elements can actually be created and stick around in significant quantities.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 111259, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 03:20:11 2017", "ups": 1}], "top_comments": [{"body": "Not in an ordinary star during the main-sequence part of its life.

Also, in the highest temperature conditions in the core there isn't a lot of lower atomic number nuclei other than alpha particles, the \"fuel\" that might be used for fusing into higher elements gets used up by more probably reactions. Even though fusing two Nickel-56 nuclei together is *possible* in the core of a giant star, the rate of it happening will be negligible.But that's not the worst problem. The other problem is that as temperatures increase and it becomes possible to fuse heavier elements the temperature reaches a range where the thermal radiation becomes energetic enough to start ripping apart atoms in a process called photodisintegration. This makes it hard for heavier elements to survive, even if they are created. And as temperatures reach towards a range where the rate of fusion of nuclei beyond Iron is non-trivial the rate of photodisintegration also climbs, tearing apart nuclei (particularly the less stable nuclei) left and right. Meanwhile, in the short window of time while this is happening the star is heading toward death in a supernova explosion.It's the comparatively low temperature conditions of heavy neutron bombardment in the \"r-process\" (such as in Type II supernovae) where heavier elements can actually be created and stick around in significant quantities.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 111259, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 03:20:11 2017", "ups": 1}], "stickied": false, "title": "Do stars fuse elements heavier than iron?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72zwbq/do_stars_fuse_elements_heavier_than_iron/", "num_comments": 6, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 16:58:33 2017", "contest_mode": false, "subreddit": "askscience", "pinned": false, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/72zwbq/do_stars_fuse_elements_heavier_than_iron/", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "over_18": false, "selftext": "Before everyone jumps in about how elements below iron undergo fusion, and above them they can undergo fission, everyone knows that.

This is done by rearranging the atoms in a molecule to attempt to reduce the energy stored in the bonds, which is why you find hydrogen and oxygen most commonly in H_2 and O_2, it is a least energy state.  Now these least energy states do not have to be the lowest energy state. This is because there will be many potential wells for the state to pass through.

The O-O bond is quite weak, with a low bond dissociation energy (~140 kJ/mol), while HOH is quite strong, with a high bond dissociation energy (~460 kJ/mol). The bond dissociation energy is simply the amount of energy it would take to degrade (break apart the chemical structure) the molecule. Understanding bond dissociation energies [can be fairly experimental](http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/GenChem2/A4/2.html). The energy of light is inversely proportional to its wavelength. This means that higher wavelength light contains lower energy. by keeping the power source constant and by shining a laser on a sample until is breaks, you can calculate the bond dissociation energy of the sample. From this, a database can be determined and referred to.Understanding why some bonds react and others do not is not always intuitive. For example, there is an ongoing debate on why a peroxide is unstable, with prevailing theories revolving around crowding of repulsive lone pairs and high electronegativity of the O-O single bond. However, that only partially explains the science and [does not account](http://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i36/made-Arkemas-peroxides-unstable-Harveys.html) for the extremely wide dissociation energies of peroxides with different substituents. However, while the black-box is a debate, the end-result is well known and tabulated and can be used to adequately predict reactivity of other molecules.So to your example H3O6, that molecule first of all cannot exist. The most charitable way of describing this molecule is through a chain of 6 oxygens (5 peroxides) with a hydronium ion on one end.

It was her key point: **\u201cThe academy has never promoted free speech as its central value,\u201d she said...**>**The central idea of Rouse\u2019s Sept. 13 lecture was that \u201cfree speech absolutism does not exist,\u201d however much it\u2019s embraced as a core American belief.**>More than a week after the lecture, which was held as part of Princeton\u2019s Constitution Day, Rouse explained her argument further: \u201cWe speak differently to different groups in different contexts,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's no society where anyone could say whatever they want at any point and expect to have no repercussions from that.\u201d>There are classic examples of this, which Rouse offered: If a doctor gives faulty treatment advice to someone at a party, they could be sued. But Rouse also offered specific examples from her field that prove free speech acts aren\u2019t without consequences. Larycia Hawkins, a professor at Wheaton College, was suspended and eventually stepped down in February 2016 after wearing a hijab at the Christian school to show solidarity with Muslims.>But Rouse\u2019s view on free speech can\u2019t just be boiled down to \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place.\u201d In classrooms, she said, the free exchange of ideas must be rooted in legitimate evidence.

You seem decently young, which to me is even worse (though it's not like rape/sexual assault is fun for any victim...). You were curious, *that is normal*. It's *normal* to think about sex at your age, to be curious about the gender/sex you're attracted to, to want to try these things that make you feel good with people who make your stomach flutter and shit like that. You're a normal girl who was assaulted by someone who felt they could hurt you for their own gratification. That doesn't make you a slut, it doesn't make you loose, it doesn't make you a bitch or anything else your attackers may call you.This is not your fault. You only think you could've done more to prevent this because it's already happened, and hindsight is 20/20 as they say, which means basically you only realize all the things you could've done AFTER the fact. You need to get help, and get support. You're not the only one this has happened to, and there are many people who will help you out if you go to the rape crisis center and speak to someone there. >Who no one knows. So who will people believe?This is another big issue rape victims have, and once you get help, and have moved on with your life you may wish to someday read about all the women who were victimized by people who were popular at their school and used that popularity and/or their families money to silence their victims. One of the biggest lies that victims are made to believe either intentionally or not is that *people will not believe them because they are not as popular or as important or whatever as their attacker*. Tell what you've told us, complete strangers, to everyone who will listen, and most who can do something. If you go to the police, get a female officer to tell. SOmeone you can be comfortable with, at least enough to file a report without feeling like they may not take you seriously. Also, and this is serious **mention that you think they might 'try to do something' like harm you or discredit you*. Making someone fear for their life is a crime (In the US the crime of Assault and Battery covers this), and I'm sure that's true even in Canada.

Get help. Sometimes we need others to support us, walk us through difficult times, be a shoulder to cry on and the rest. They will help you. Secondly, and more importantly what i am writing this to address, NO, you're not a slut. You seem decently young, which to me is even worse (though it's not like rape/sexual assault is fun for any victim...). You were curious, *that is normal*. It's *normal* to think about sex at your age, to be curious about the gender/sex you're attracted to, to want to try these things that make you feel good with people who make your stomach flutter and shit like that. You're a normal girl who was assaulted by someone who felt they could hurt you for their own gratification. That doesn't make you a slut, it doesn't make you loose, it doesn't make you a bitch or anything else your attackers may call you.This is not your fault. You only think you could've done more to prevent this because it's already happened, and hindsight is 20/20 as they say, which means basically you only realize all the things you could've done AFTER the fact. You need to get help, and get support. You're not the only one this has happened to, and there are many people who will help you out if you go to the rape crisis center and speak to someone there. >Who no one knows. So who will people believe?This is another big issue rape victims have, and once you get help, and have moved on with your life you may wish to someday read about all the women who were victimized by people who were popular at their school and used that popularity and/or their families money to silence their victims. One of the biggest lies that victims are made to believe either intentionally or not is that *people will not believe them because they are not as popular or as important or whatever as their attacker*. Tell what you've told us, complete strangers, to everyone who will listen, and most who can do something. If you go to the police, get a female officer to tell. SOmeone you can be comfortable with, at least enough to file a report without feeling like they may not take you seriously. Also, and this is serious **mention that you think they might 'try to do something' like harm you or discredit you*. Making someone fear for their life is a crime (In the US the crime of Assault and Battery covers this), and I'm sure that's true even in Canada. If you talk to the school administration after you speak to the center and a councilor, make sure you are speaking to a woman or have one present.Don't let them still abuse you. Don't let them get away with this. You will get through this, and you will lead a normal life and meet many people who you may date or have similar romantic entanglements with.Don't let these assholes ruin your life, by keeping you from speaking out and keeping you from fighting back or taunting you until you attempt to harm yourself.

I don't want to sound needy, I don't want to come across as looking for attention. But my life has been spiralling out of control. These past three months or so I've been contemplating suicide because I was raped in the summer by a guy who I'll call Max. I had a slight crush on him and I considered my friend him. I was a slut and curious and wanted to try oral sex.Then the day after I was raped, I went to the gym and met a friend who I'll call Gabe. He told me how his one friend hated me and I started to try and I wanted to leave his house. He didn't let me leave his house. He pushed me to tell him I was raped. Now, we are not friends anymore because he got pissed off I kissed a guy at a club. All of his friends seriously hate me. He hates me. They stare at me every where I go. Gabe is telling everyone I'm a fake bitch. He's spreading rumours about me sleeping with guys and mentioned I was raped to people too. A friend of mine told me Gabe was talking and spreading lots of terrible rumours about me.Last week I confronted Max in person about the rape. He told me he remembered me pushing him off of me and saying no. Then he told me if I remembered when he asked me if he could and I said yes. That never happened. He never asked, he just did it. He kept asking me what's going to happen and what i was trying to say. Now today through text he is denying it that I pushed him off. He's saying I wanted it. I didn't want it.I'm not sure what to do next. I went everywhere I could. Talked to my friends, talked to Student Services at my school, I'm going to talk to a counsellor, I went to Sexual Assault Clinic. I really messed my life up. Max is on the soccer team at my school. Everyone knows him. Everyone loves him. I'm just an average girl. Who no one knows. So who will people believe? A miss nobody? or a Mr. somebody? I will loose all of my dear male friends. They'll hate me too. I never remotely did anything sexual. I was a virgin and he ripped it from me. I'm dead. From everything. From Gabe taunting me, his friends whispering about me, to Max denying he raped me, to me hating myself for never going to the Hospital after he raped me. God I hate myself. Why was I even born? Things have gotten even worse for me. I'm not sure what to do. I saw Max and Gabe together often this week. I feel that they are conspiring something against me. Gabe knows I was raped, and Max now knows I considered what he did to me as rape. Word spreads fast and I am sure the two stories collided. I don't know what to do. I can't go to the police because they can't do anything for me. I didn't get a rape kit done because I was dead and mortified. I have no physical proof of the rape happening. It'll be his word against mine. He makes it sound like I'm regretting having sex with him and now I'm the girl who's crying rape. Please, these dark thoughts have been gathering in my mind for a long time. I can't tell my friends about it because I know they'll tell my parents or someone else I know.

I want to stress the importance of this aspect, as, when a vulva/vagina is washed (Do NOT use soap inside of it!) it should just taste like skin, or sometimes it'll taste sweet/tangy, depending on your hormonal makeup, stress levels, time of the month, etc. Also, more common sense stuff like don't have sex after a workout for the sake of cleanliness (sweat can taste awfully funny down there, and if you've been somewhere dirty, infection risk increases), change your underwear every day (No excuses due to ever changing vaginal secretion amount/content), make sure your underwear is stuff your skin/vulva can breathe in.Protip: For the above--Do NOT douche. You will make things worse. The vagina is a self cleaning mechanism that has a PH balance to maintain. Using luke-warm/warmer water will do the job JUST fine.Go and see your local GP. I hope they're able to get you where you need to be, health-wise, to enjoy the cunn(t)ing arts once more.

I made my decision and I'll be sticking to it. Now, the state I live in has gone out of way to take away a woman's right to choose and I'm surrounded by states with similar views, which makes access tricky. I live no where near a provider and it requires multiple visits. But, I've got all the logistics and appoints made. In the meantime, the hormones have kicked into overdrive. I ended up telling the other party, even though I never really intended to. I was going through an emotional overload. I got more news I didn't want to hear today and I guess I was either trying to make him feel what I was going through in that moment or maybe I was looking for a little support. We had the \"what if\" discussion before, so I knew he his reaction wouldn't be good. I wouldn't want it to be good. I didn't even expect it to be nice. But now that I think about how he reacted, it actually seems cruel. The problem is, those damn hormones. I don't know if he was really being cruel or if I'm overreacting. First, there was the stupid, childish thing he did. He blocked me on Facebook. But somehow, when he did it, he also sent a friend request, which he withdrew after I got it. That was stupid and childish, but whatever. My first reaction wasn't all that great either. Unfortunately, I sent him a text asking about the friend request before I realized what was going on, which led to us talking. He told me that he didn't want to hear about any of this. That if I decided to have the kid, he wouldn't be involved and he wouldn't help in any way. Then he threw in that he'd be down for some sex though.Like I said, my initial reaction was pretty bad. I decided to run one of the trails near my house, stopped about halfway through, then laid in the woods crying until it started getting dark and went back to my house and drank wine straight out of the bottle while I was in the shower washing the wilderness out of my hair. So, by comparison, it's not all that bad. Plus I pretty much FEEL the same way. I don't want to know about any of this. I don't want any part in raising another kid. And, thanks to the hormones, I could really go for sex more often than not. Plus I was prepared for a less than enthusiastic reaction. But now that I've thought about it, it seems cruel. Sure, I FEEL the same way. But I wouldn't tell a pregnant woman that. Especially one that was crying at the time. That's just the way it feels to me. There is a small chance I may be blowing things out of proportion though. Yesterday at the grocery store, a lady took the last loaf of fresh garlic bread from the display and I was suddenly pretty sure I was willing to murder her over it. Keep in mind, I wasn't at the display when she took it so she had no idea I might have possibly even wanted it. I didn't go to the store with any intention of buying garlic bread and I really didn't want any until she took the last one. So, if you've made it this far, you now know what it's like inside the mind of a pregnant woman. Unfocused, rambling and often incoherent. Honestly, I cut this down by over half before posting, there's a lot going on in my head right now. But thanks for sticking around, I actually do have a question. Is it really to much to expect a little support? Even if he has to fake it? If I'm irrationally pissed off at him for no reason other than the fact that he is 50% responsible for this situation (even if he doesn't think so), should't I be allowed to call and bitch for a minute? When the hormones really start getting the better of me and reminding me of all of the reasons I really could raise another child if I wanted to, shouldn't I be able to expect a little help through it? It eventually subsides after reminding myself of all the reasons I don't want another kid, but it would help to have someone else to talk it through with.

For months she didn't work and she has become financially dependent on him. Over the past year and a half he has gone through her phone, Facebook, and email asking questions like \"who is this guy?\" or more troubling \"why do you have emails from your ex?\" (it is important to note here that these emails were written over a year before they even met) He has told her that it makes him uncomfortable that she has conversations with her male coworkers and doesn't tell him about them.

My father is not my birth father. I actually have no father on my birth certificate. Just my mom. My mother is a wonderful woman. She is strong, willful, bright, an all around beautiful person. She got pregnant with me in her senior year of high school, and proceeded to give me a wonderful life. She met my Stepfather when I was only a year old, and they married within six months. Truly I have never seen a couple more in love and dedicated to one another.My step dad, we'll just call him B, worked hard to give us the life we deserved. He gave my mother to more amazing kids, my sister and brother. I love them with all my heart.I, however, hate myself. I've suffered from depression and anxiety from a young age. It's been a long, hard road, and it's been lonely. The reason I hate myself is B.Now, don't get me wrong, I appreciate everything B has given my family. A roof over our heads, food on the table, wonderful vacations. We had it all. We even adopted some kids, and now I have one more sister and two more little brothers.But it started when I was young. Maybe seven. The touching. B would touch me in places I didn't know were wrong at the time, down my panties, on my bum. I didn't know any better. It progressed as I got older. Once I blossomed and got breasts, his attentions went there as well. At one point he told me o had to remove my own pants of I wanted it to go further.My own stepfather, the one I counted on to protect me...That was when I was fourteen, in high school. I'd worked through this so many times in my head, and I finally told my mom, hoping she would help.She didn't believe me, B lied about it all.She even questioned me.\"He didn't do anything to your sister, why would he do anything to you?\"I pretended it never happened, but I started looking for love in all the wrong places. I was angry, I was hurt. I had sex with anyone who would look at me. Anyone who would whisper sweet nothing's to me. I was sixteen.I was in my junior year of high school.I hated myself.Did I make it up? Was it a continuous nightmare I couldn't wake from? My hate became scars on my arms and legs.Why would he lie? Didn't B care at all how I felt?I kept my mouth shut, and eventually the memories buried themselves deep down in my brain until I shut them out.But one night, at two AM, they emerged again and I was  a mess. I was a sobbing, shaking, crying mess because I finally knew it was wrong. What he did was wrong. And I would be forever scarred from it.I couldn't focus in school the next day, I broke down in my computer class. I wanted to die.I called my mom and asked her to meet me at a restaurant in town, only her.I told her again, much calmer this time, about what happened between B and I.She was angry.At me.Again, B denied it.Again, she believed him.What sucks? I've forgiven him. In my heart, I've forgiven him for everything he had done. I can't change him. I know I could try, but I can't. I've forgiven someone who has never given me an apology.I'm posting in here because I need to know someone, somewhere is listening... that what happened to me actually happened. That I'm not lying and that I'm broken and sad and depressed but I forgive him and I just want to move on.

There are many reasons for that:1. This study was done on cells in culture, not on live animals, and especially not on humans. Cell cultures are easy to kill. Too much water? Dead. Too much light? Dead. Too low a temperature? Too high? Dead. 2. The ethanol used to mix the raspberry compound could easily have been enough to inhibit the cells. From reading the abstract, I don't know that they controlled for that. 3. The study involved a treatment that isn't really possible on people, long-term soaking of the cells with this compound. Maybe in people this would be accomplished by applying some sort of soaked bandage to the area? In humans, concentrations necessary would likely result in systemic absorption (which may not be safe for the raspberry compound) and may also cause some unwanted side effects (such as significant inebriation). The study involved literally days of soaking in the raspberry alcohol mixture. In addition, of the cervical cancer in humans was any deeper than a few layers of cells (which it often is) the cells might not be reached enough from the surface to have an effect. 4. At least some of the cervical cancer lines used are not necessarily representative of cervical cancer.

There are many reasons for that:1. This study was done on cells in culture, not on live animals, and especially not on humans. Cell cultures are easy to kill. Too much water? Dead. Too much light? Dead. Too low a temperature? Too high? Dead. 2. The ethanol used to mix the raspberry compound could easily have been enough to inhibit the cells. From reading the abstract, I don't know that they controlled for that. 3. The study involved a treatment that isn't really possible on people, long-term soaking of the cells with this compound. Maybe in people this would be accomplished by applying some sort of soaked bandage to the area? In humans, concentrations necessary would likely result in systemic absorption (which may not be safe for the raspberry compound) and may also cause some unwanted side effects (such as significant inebriation). The study involved literally days of soaking in the raspberry alcohol mixture. In addition, of the cervical cancer in humans was any deeper than a few layers of cells (which it often is) the cells might not be reached enough from the surface to have an effect. 4.

The parents of the cadet candidates havebeen contacted and Security Forces are investigating the incident.  In themeantime, Col Redacted has addressed students and permanent party at the PrepSchool, and has engaged with our Chief Diversity Officer to initiatefacilitated small group discussions with the cadet candidates as theinvestigation continues. Photos of the message boards were sent to some ofthe parents by the cadet candidates, and the photos have begun to appear insocial media.It is important to understand that concepts like Respect and Dignity are notnegotiable. They are central to our culture, and absolutely critical toleadership in today's Air Force.  That's the SUPTs and my red line, and itwill NOT be crossed. I know you share the same red line, but incidents suchas this serve as a reminder that we must continue to keep the conversationson these issues alive on our campus.  On that note, I would like to applaudthe Monday evening \"Critical Conversations\" event the Dean hosted where 145cadets and faculty attended to discuss current events, including race atUSAFA. We've all seen the ongoing controversy in the NFL and witnessed the falloutsince the riots and violence in Charlottesville, and we know theconversations that are happening in our society and in social media. I wouldlike us all to be engaging in these tough conversations, in a civil mannerthat spurs more discussion and reaches productive solutions. To that end andto be clear: do not avoid the topic. I expect you to have conversations withrespect and dignity. The discourse is how we grow and how we develop asfuture officers.Each year, 1,200 new cadets join us from around the country and across theworld, alongside the 200+ cadet candidates at the Prep School. But once wearrive here and get immersed in the Air Force culture, it must be absolutelyclear how we look out for and respect one another. This isn't about one incident at the prep school - it is about ensuring ourmessage is clear regarding the way we treat one another, every single day.Thank you for your leadership, for your active engagement, and for yourownership of the culture we foster at this Academy.
