I don't see how Pauli exclusion relates to this question.The second question is how does Pauli exclusion work for identical particles in \"similar\" states? If you have a free electron in space, its quantum state can be written as a spatial wavefunction and a spinor. If you now consider two electrons, and ignore their spins (or prepare them so that they have the same spin state), antisymmetrization forces the spatial part of their combined state to be antisymmetric.In other words, the spatial wavefunction must take the form\u03a8(**r***_1_*,**r***_2_*) = [\u03c6*_1_*(**r***_1_*)\u03c6*_2_*(**r***_2_*) - \u03c6*_1_*(**r***_2_*)\u03c6*_2_*(**r***_1_*)]/sqrt(2).It's clear than that this is identically zero if **r***_1_* = **r***_2_*.

Let's take a \"one dimensional box\" where the electron can only assume many states in one dimension, but can only  assume one state in the other two dimensions.If the electron is confined to the box, its wave function is zero at its boundary, as it can not be found in the wall of the box.

The answers other people gave are good, but I suspect you are looking for a more direct answer to the first question. My answer is not the one you get from textbooks, so keep in mind it is a little outside the mainstream, but it was killing it in the 19th century.If you define the state of a system in terms of idealized point masses with a certain number of  momentum numbers and a certain number of position numbers, the system would appear at first to have an infinite number of possible states, even for a single particle, even in one dimension, because all of the quantities with which you defined the state of the system would appear to fall on a continuum. So if each of those points is distinguishable, wouldn't the possible states be infinite in number?As others said already, phase space is how they count it in such a way that it can be said to be finite, but it doesn't directly answer the question. The answer is that there are multiple implicit assumptions about laws of motion that are hardly ever stated explicitly, but without which, the number of states would indeed be infinite. The most basic assumption would be that if something has a certain momentum and a certain position, then those coordinates determine its momentum and position at a earlier and later time. The implicit premise would be that momentum is conserved. When you used momentum for one of the coordinates, you implicitly used time as a coordinate and defined a rate between them. So even though the position could fall on an infinite number of possible points, all those points would be related by a clear law. So the number of possible states the system could be in, is not nearly as large as you might think, and our knowledge of the state, that is, the inverse of the number of states in which it could be, is greater than you might think.For example, if a point mass, like an idealized train car, were to go in one dimensional motion between two extremes of a track, with a boundary at each end, you would describe its number of possible states without counting every possible point in the middle as a different state. Because, if you knew the state at one time, you would know the state at all other times, also.Now, if you added a second train car, of the same kind, and it followed the same rules, (elastic collisions, conserved momentum, et cetera) the conserved quantities allow you to do the same thing with two cars. Whatever momentum is lost by one element of the system would have to be gained by another element of the system. The exchange of momentum is governed by a law. Therefore, the possible states would not be infinite, but rather, they would increase exponentially with the number of elements. That is why the \"state variables\" (volume, temperature, pressure...)  are essential to the idea that the entropy can be counted. If momentum or energy or other quantities are not conserved, no law of motion can predict the evolution of the system, and so the number of possible states is indeed infinite. In the simplified track with two cars on it, the state variable \"temperature\" would be the average kinetic energy of the cars. So you can see that there would be other states possible, if only the \"temperature\" of the system changed, that is, if they lost energy to something outside the system, of if energy were imparted to them. The state variable \"pressure\" would work the same way. So would \"volume\". If the number of possible states were to be increased in some way, it would have to involve something that changed one of those state variables, which essentially amounts to changing the total energy or momentum.Hope that is of some value to you.

Chemistry is included in this, but it fortunately is a very provable field of science in many ways, as, for one, you can do a reaction in front of you, get the results you predicted from previous experimental data and/or experimental data made laws/rules, even without doing that reaction itself before, and, if following the same procedure, keep getting the same result, which is a large basis of science.  You can use all kinds of devices, like thermometers, pH testers, or even NMR Spectroscopy or X-Ray Crystallography, etc., to figure out the composition, and even structure of your products.  On the topic of reaction mechanisms, they are important especially for rate laws in general chemistry, and some pure chemistry, but are not just for rate laws in organic chemistry, they are also for reaction prediction, pure chemistry, and many other both pure and applied science things.  I have seen many papers written on the following topic: Virtually anyone learning organic chemistry learns mechanisms, and are commonly told, or realize, to see them as theory, but theory that has very heavy basis in previous experimental data, especially ones that make up the bulk of scientific laws/rules.  They are also commonly told to see mechanisms as the most likely possibility, as scientists before have worked to rule out other possibilities, which is normally counted under the \"proven\" category, to get the final solid theory that is the approved mechanism, from the earlier proposed mechanism.  Now, I'm not saying that some tiny amount of weird intermediates won't form and/or some tiny amount weird products may form in almost any reaction, mostly through some one-off mechanism/pathway, but the approved mechanism, like SN1, Aldol Condensation, the Mannich Reaction, E1, SN2, Fischer Esterification, etc., is, from the previously stated scientific laws/rules from experimental data and other scientists experiments to rule out other possibilities, the most likely possibility of what takes place most frequently in the real-life reaction.  Another note to add, many mechanisms, like in the case of how either H2O, HSO4, alcohol, and another carboxylic acid molecule could all remove the hydrogen in a reaction, with varying degrees of possibility, but only one is normally shown in a mechanism.  Although true, this is not necessary to show in a mechanism, as this can typically be figured out by whoever is looking at the mechanism, and it is nitpicking on my part.  Also, most people who have an interest in chemistry, especially organic, likely think mechanisms are really cool, it's really neat to see how reactions take place at the molecular/atomic level, I know I think that it's one of my favorite parts of chemistry.  So, to cut to the chase, I was wondering if anyone knows of a fast NMR done on an SN1 mechanism that shows a protonated OH group or a carbocation intermediate, I just thought that it would be pretty cool.  **TL;DR:** Reaction mechanisms are theory, but aren't just willy nilly, they normally have great basis in experimental/observational data and scientific rules/laws done by scientists, and are to be looked at as not the only path that molecules could take to form products, as some strange intermediates and products may be found in miniscule amounts, but mechanisms are the extremely likely path that will mostly be happening in a reaction, this is all referring to approved mechanisms of course, such as Fischer Esterification, after the other ones have been proved to be ruled out, or realized to be less probable.  Either way, it is really cool to know what is happening between most molecules on the molecular/atomic level in a reaction that I can do in front of myself, that is my favorite part of mechanisms.  Anyone else here like that that too?  Also, this got me thinking, does anyone have an NMR of an SN1 mechanism reaction that shows a carbocation/protonated OH?  I think that would be pretty neat.  **Significantly Mentionable Edit:** A note, if anyone is wondering why what you are reading may sound familiar, a lot of the discussed concepts are from a lot of different papers that I've been reading recently, but especially from this one: [ACS Link](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed086p551) and [Direct PDF from ACS Link](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed086p551) Edit 2: Sorry, I had a lowercase n in the places were I said SN1 and SN2, it's fixed now, besides the title, obviously.", "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "over_18": false, "submission_time": "Sun Oct  1 20:26:15 2017", "id": "73ml7e", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 1, "gilded": 0, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "Radio telescopes listen to signals that are far, Far, FAR, *FAR*, **FAR** away, with signals that are as faint as they get as they cross the cosmic chasm.You tend to need a little bit of more elaborate rig to capture that signal than you do when you're listening to a ClearChannel-branded marketing channel.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 230953, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  2 03:52:24 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Wavelength.

My questions are :1.What is Metric Tensor and what does it do with addition to gravity, I am aware of complexity and difficulty of definition, especially since it is a lot of math. (I prefer everyone to explain easily, please)2.What are significant differences between GTR and Scalar-Vector (or Scalar-Tensor-Vector) theories?3.As far as i remember our space is euclidean and is flat and hyperbolic. Geometry of universe is major factor for creating possible topology and structure of universe.. Spherical space, for example would somehow cause gravity to pull all mater to one point therefore overcoming dark energy which is responsible fot expansion...So what exactly is geometry of universe, its shape and its effect on gravity/mass? I still study, pardon if i made some fatal mistakes or faults... I'm very interested in this topic so i ask everyone who is willing to explain the whole thing, to do deeply and add as much details as possible. Thank you.

As nicely laid out in this [Scientific American article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/critical-opalescence/what-happens-to-google-maps-when-tectonic-plates-move/), these two coordinate systems have different references. For NAD83, coordinates are tied to the North American plate so for the majority of the US (the portion of California on the Pacific plate would be an exception) coordinates move with the North American plate so do not change as a function of long-term plate motion (but could still change due to local tectonic effects not accounted for in the reference frame). For WGS84, the reference system is based on the Earth's center of mass and is not tied to any particular plate so the coordinates for locations change through time (i.e. the angular and distance relations between two coordinates do not change, so if the angular and distance relations between two points on land change, this means that they have new coordinates). As a consequence (and as illustrated in the Sci Am article) this means there is a gradual increasing disagreement between NAD83 coordinates and WGS84 in the US.As described in some level of technical detail in this set of [lecture slides](http://www.naref.org/transf/nad83_hydroscan2006.pdf), these days most coordinate systems are tied to the [International Terrestrial Reference Frame](http://itrf.ign.fr/general.php), which is a combination of a lot of things, but includes a regularly updated estimate of the location of the Earth's center of mass (for reference systems which use this as their zero point) and plate motion models so that one can specify a time and get a coordinate. As you can also see if you dig into those slides enough, both WGS84 and NAD83 have been updated periodically to account for changes, for WGS84 changing approximations of the Earth's center of mass mean slight changes in the coordinates and for NAD83, I think the big change was just a way to transform between NAD83 coordinates and ITRF based coordinates. Now, a related question might be, for the average person, does this matter? Probably not. If you were to measure your position with a handheld GPS in WGS84 coordinates (internally they all are using WGS84, if you have it display the coordinates in something else, it's doing a conversion anyway) at the exact same spot year after year, theoretically the coordinates would change, but in practice, using consumer grade GPS receivers, your position is never accurate enough for this to matter.

The exception might be in the case of rapid changes in location, like extreme surface deformation associated with an earthquake. Say, if you had driven a spike into the ground right next to a fault and measured your location in WGS84 and then an earthquake happened and there was 10 meters of motion on the fault at the surface and you then remeasured your location, you might see a change in your coordinates, again depending on the accuracy of your GPS receiver.

Nearly 150 people from FEMA were there before the hurricane with food, medical supplies, cots, you name it. Right after the hurricane hit, the 26th MEU (Marine Expeditionary Unit), consisting of almost10k troops in total and with a full load of humanitarian relief supplies (part of their mission statement) were sent right in. The had to dodge the storm and some pretty rough seas to get there. The medical ship was sent later, after an assessment and decision was made that there was a need for it there. The coast guard has been there for a while, but unsure whenNow, only 2500 or so of they 8000 national guard has been deployed by the governor of Puerto Rico, but that is because many of the national guard are either dealing with their own disasters or because many of them are already posted as police, other law enforcement and medical personnel.So, plenty of relief is being sent, but not only do we have a lot of resources tied up elsewhere for 2 other impactful storms, there is more need in Puerto Rico than is easily managed and it takes time.I have a friend in the 26th MEU who has told me the main issue they are dealing with is the collapse of the countries infrastructure and the lack of open roads to all areas. It takes time to cut through trees, debris blocking roads and they are trying to deal with a massive amount of relief supplies and personnel while having \"nowhere/everywhere\" to send them.

Most of the messages and comments I get from guys I tend to just reply with a stand \"thank you!\" or something else if I'm not really interested. But every once in a blue moon, a guy (and rarer occasions a girl) will peak my interest enough for me to talk to them outside of reddit on various messaging apps.

He lives relatively close to the city that I'm staying in for college so we've been meeting up frequently these past 2 months. Maybe it's because deep down inside I'm a bit of a creep, but I decided to look through his reddit page because why not? He's looked at my GW AND \"normal\" reddit pages and I have nothing to hide from him. As I was scrolling and clicking away at the pages, I noticed something and I honestly thought my heart stopped; He posted a comment along the lines of \"I honestly hate it when my *father in law* just casually drives in the left lane\" or something like that. I felt (and still feel) so angry and betrayed and heartbroken and so many other emotions that I don't think I can comprehend. I hate that I'm so insecure and lonely that I actually opened up to someone that I've only known for a short while. I hate that I\u2019m a hypocrite for saying that I\u2019m a feminist after all this. I just feel\u2026. Ashamed, disgusted, and alone and  I don\u2019t know what to do.

I\u2019m going to start this by acknowledging that the behaviors and feelings I have are unhealthy. I\u2019m aware of this. I\u2019m looking for others who have felt the same thing and gotten over it/accepted it. My first relationship was with a guy who was no bueno. I had just turned 14, he was almost 18, and I left the relationship feeling disgusting. He never raped me but I did feel like he assaulted me by getting angry and pressuring me. I\u2019ve accepted this and while I\u2019m not proud of it, I know it wasn\u2019t my fault. Fast forward 5 years, I\u2019m in a super awesome relationship. I met my guy in an honors program at school and he\u2019s my absolute best friend. I hate to gush about people but he\u2019s by far the most responsible, mature, and loving person I\u2019ve ever met. We\u2019ve been together for a year now and while we have no plans of tying the knot, Id say yes if he asked. He\u2019s the best influence I\u2019ve ever had in my life. He\u2019s been with one girl before. That didn\u2019t really bother me until he and I started having sex without condoms. Idk why. I waited about 2 months before we slept together, and then another 4 before I stopped using condoms because I\u2019m on birth control. I also let him finish inside me (sorry if that\u2019s tmi). I shouldn\u2019t have asked him this, but I asked if he didn\u2019t use condoms/finish inside of his last girlfriend. He said yes and it honestly broke my heart. This was a few months ago and I\u2019ve accepted it for the most part but I still feel sad about it sometimes. For me, I gave up the last meaningful thing to a person I love, thinking that it\u2019d be the first time for him and it wasn\u2019t. Listen, I know virginity isn\u2019t as important as people say but it is to me. I had something that was valuable to me taken away and decided to do something that was not only scary for me but just had a lot of meaning. We\u2019ve talked about it before and he isn\u2019t proud of doing what he did with his ex, but he made it clear that he can\u2019t change his past and neither can I. His past experiences don\u2019t change who he is now. He continues to be a good person through and through. I really admire him and his honesty, but I still feel sad that I never got to share my first time with a person I care about. I don\u2019t know what to do or how to get rid of feelings that I know are unhealthy. It hasn\u2019t damaged our relationship but I don\u2019t want it to either. I dunno. If you\u2019ve experienced something similar let me know, it\u2019s been a few months and I still get sad about it.

If she doesn't come forward and ask you for something, ask her what you can do to help.That said, also make sure you take care of yourself. If you feel you need professional help dealing with the emotional stress it puts you in, find someone who you can talk to about it. Don't go behind her back though because that will erode trust.

You're prioritizing her safety. Speaking as someone who was assaulted, the best you can be is supportive, and show her she can rely on you. It's going to take a lot of time for her to battle this out, but knowing that someone is in her corner, even if she's not talking about it, will make it that much better. Whenever I get romantic with a guy, I get terrified of telling him. What will he say? Will he be turned off? Think of me as \"damaged goods\" or \"too much drama\"? Should I tell him at all?So she was probably going through similar thoughts, or at least stressing about telling you. The fact that you've reacted so positively helps a lot. Don't pretend it didn't happen, but don't change the fundamental of the relationship you have now, if that makes sense. Also, anything sexual, just be patient. She may tense up. She will probably change her mind about one thing or another and may not know how to tell you, so be sure to look for clues- her getting quiet, stiffening, covering her face, or grabbing your hands or arms tightly if you move them to a direction she's not ready for them to go. She may also break down and start crying, shaking and having a panic attack. It was fairly common for me. You've already shown you're a great boyfriend who cares about her, just keep going and be there for her, and know that how you responded is fantastic. Also, don't forget to think about yourself in this. You sound very patient and loving already, so good for that! Just know that if there comes a time, or many times when it seems like she wants to be intimate then changes her mind, there's going to be a chance for frustration on both sides. My ex-boyfriend would get hurt/frustrated when this happened because he felt like I was treating him as though he was a rapist, even though I knew I was safe with him. Rationally, I did know I was safe. But there's also a part of me that was saying I was in danger from the trauma, and I would shake and cry and get quiet. So if she rejects you, it's not necessarily you. Her mind and body are telling her she's in danger, and getting angry or snapping at her when this happens is only going to reinforce what's stressing her out. I was also angry at myself for being unable to do what I wanted. I wanted to be intimate, but wouldn't be able to loosen up or just be in the moment, and it just takes time.

Be trustworthy.  Have a good feel for what she wants and is looking for, regarding sex and in her life in general, and be a friend to her first and foremost, human-to-human, Christian-values-like.  And have 0 tolerance for predatory behavior among your friends.2. Don't forget to respect yourself.  You're her suitor / lover / whatever your relationship is.  Trying to make it something it's not in order to help her is not really going to be helpful, I don't think.  I think love can do really amazing things for people, but don't lead her on like you're the kind of person who can help if you're not willing to be that committed.  Be honest about how much you care about her as a friend, and whether you'd honestly withdraw your support if you guys broke up.  And if you are committed, honor that commitment, because it might mean the world to her and be a big help in her life.  Be close with her and help with her healing to the extent you *want* to, and be very honest about what the relationship is to you.  And respect the other relationships, and desire for other relationships, in her life that are part of her support network.3.

You're prioritizing her safety. Speaking as someone who was assaulted, the best you can be is supportive, and show her she can rely on you. It's going to take a lot of time for her to battle this out, but knowing that someone is in her corner, even if she's not talking about it, will make it that much better. Whenever I get romantic with a guy, I get terrified of telling him. What will he say? Will he be turned off? Think of me as \"damaged goods\" or \"too much drama\"? Should I tell him at all?So she was probably going through similar thoughts, or at least stressing about telling you. The fact that you've reacted so positively helps a lot. Don't pretend it didn't happen, but don't change the fundamental of the relationship you have now, if that makes sense. Also, anything sexual, just be patient. She may tense up. She will probably change her mind about one thing or another and may not know how to tell you, so be sure to look for clues- her getting quiet, stiffening, covering her face, or grabbing your hands or arms tightly if you move them to a direction she's not ready for them to go. She may also break down and start crying, shaking and having a panic attack. It was fairly common for me. You've already shown you're a great boyfriend who cares about her, just keep going and be there for her, and know that how you responded is fantastic. Also, don't forget to think about yourself in this. You sound very patient and loving already, so good for that! Just know that if there comes a time, or many times when it seems like she wants to be intimate then changes her mind, there's going to be a chance for frustration on both sides. My ex-boyfriend would get hurt/frustrated when this happened because he felt like I was treating him as though he was a rapist, even though I knew I was safe with him. Rationally, I did know I was safe. But there's also a part of me that was saying I was in danger from the trauma, and I would shake and cry and get quiet. So if she rejects you, it's not necessarily you. Her mind and body are telling her she's in danger, and getting angry or snapping at her when this happens is only going to reinforce what's stressing her out. I was also angry at myself for being unable to do what I wanted. I wanted to be intimate, but wouldn't be able to loosen up or just be in the moment, and it just takes time.

I've posted elsewhere but would like some exclusively female input as well.  This occurred in my first semester of college. There was this girl who was really into me, and had gotten a number of our mutual friends to lobby me into hooking up with/becoming a thing with her at various times. So one night I was planning on staying in and just chilling with a couple of friends, but around 10:30 get a call from another friend, let's call him Elvis, who is pregaming with the girl, Morgan, and she told him that she wanted to hook up with me (not the first time she had expressed interest in me through mutual friends). So he convinces me to come out, and when I get to the place, Elvis and two other mutual friends immediately descend on me, grab me and steer me to Morgan and we start talking. Eventually we end up at her dorm at the end of the night.We start hooking up, she's really into it, actively engaging in and escalating foreplay which includes both of us undressing each other completely and fingering/handjob action. I go to get a condom, but as I start to open it she says \"no\". So I stop and ask what's up. She tells me we'd been drinking (though neither of us were more than buzzed) and that she's never done it with someone she wasn't in a relationship with. I say ok and put the condom away, and then start fingering her again at the same time putting her hand on my dick like we had been doing previously. She wasn't wet anymore, and didn't react (negatively or positively) except to remove her hand, but because of those two reasons I stopped fingering her after like a second or two because I wasn't sure if she was into it anymore, based on her reaction. I then decide to leave and that's that.Now that I'm older and more experienced I realize that I should have just talked to her instead of abruptly leaving, and should have asked her to clarify what exactly she was saying no to in order to avoid potential misunderstandings. Anyway, we continued being friendly after that, and she continued to occasionally text me, dm me on twitter, and send me snapchats (unprovoked), so it doesn't seem like she was really bothered. A few months after our hookup she also \"liked\" a facebooked status I posted against rape.  To this day she is still quite friendly as well.I'm not sure if I'm scum who accidentally sexually assaulted her with the second fingering or if anxiety (I have actual anxiety) is making me overthink things.I'm really worried that what I misinterpreted her saying she didn't want to have sex, but that she actually meant she didn't want to do anything including the fooling around we had just been doing.  *All of the names have been changed for privacy reasons.What do you think, ladies?

They may display arrogance and think lowly and negatively of others, and lack remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude to those they have harmed. Irresponsibility is a core characteristic of this disorder: they can have significant difficulties in maintaining stable employment as well as fulfilling their social and financial obligations, and people with this disorder often lead exploitative, unlawful, or parasitic lifestyles.Those with antisocial personality disorder are often impulsive and reckless, failing to consider or disregarding the consequences of their actions. They may repeatedly disregard and jeopardize their own safety and the safety of others, and place themselves and others in danger. They are often aggressive and hostile and display a disregulated temper, and can lash out violently with provocation or frustration.Serious problems with interpersonal relationships are often seen in those with the disorder. Attachments and emotional bonds are weak, and interpersonal relationships often revolve around the manipulation, exploitation and abuse of others.
