Now hear me out, I don't mean \"fuck the troops\" by a long shot. But glorification of service is reaching insane levels. It's almost cultish.

We vowed to never let that happen again and like they say, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\".It has gotten to the point where I doubt people actually truly care about the troops. I mean, surely if we cared about them we wouldn't be so eager to go to war even after being at war for the last 16 years. I feel like people use the troops to push their political agenda.For instance, does anyone remember when Caitlyn Jenner was being deemed as brave and Facebook had a meme war where one side decided that the only people deserving of being called brave were the troops? If you think that makes you a good and patriotic American, then you have a narrow definition of patriotism. We have a word for you in the service, you're called \"bootlickers\". The US military does not own bravery. That being said, I did not find CJ to be \"brave\". Y'all got duped, CJ is no hero. Come out as trans in rural America, that's fuckin' bravery. But that's neither here nor there.Then there was the dress and nobody could decide what color it was. Remember that? And then a certain side went to war on Facebook again \"[insert political party here] cares too much about the color of a dress. Can our troops get some love?\" Like seriously, what the fuck? How did the color of a goddamn dress have anything to do with supporting the troops?Then you have bootlickers on Facebook who post pictures of servicemembers who were KIA in the wars and it's a new one everyday. You're not supporting the troops, you're virtue signalling at the expense of someone (and their family) who died. You didn't know this person. You can't even tell me anything about them. I know a lot of people who would be rolling in their graves if they knew they became a fucking meme to push your political agenda.And this brings us to kneeling for the national anthem. Leave the troops out of it. You say people died for that anthem, for that flag? Fuck off. If anything, they died so you could have the right to kneel, the right to protest, the freedom to speak your mind. The Constitution doesn't begin and end with the 2nd Amendment. If I were there, I would kneel, if for no other reason than I don't like being told what to do, how to think, and how to feel.So yeah, troop worship is unhealthy for society.

I was desperate for human company and couldn't get the time of day from anyone else, so I was just going with it. So my birthday rolls around and I'm not REALLY a birthday person, I usually just go get some takeout and feel mildly cheerful about it. I don't plan parties or events or anything. But one girl in the group INSISTS that we do a dinner out \"for my birthday\" so I'm thinking maybe it's turning around, maybe I'm actually someone in this group. I pick my favorite place to go eat, which is NOT somewhere pricy or complicated, and we go. I'm feeling excited because the group is coming and the guy I have a crush on is coming too.We go eat and then it's time for the check. She announces that everyone is splitting my bill, and NUMEROUS people act surprised about it. It was very weird for me because I had consumed probably under $25 of food, so even though I was kinda broke at the time covering $25 of someone's food for their birthday even by myself I would not have made a big deal about it. People GRUDGINGLY cover my check and the mood is immediately sour. We proceed to her next stop, her apartment, where the guy I have a crush on leaves IMMEDIATELY.

The main thing I've learned is that people fall into different groups regarding weight/looks:Some people don't seem to notice or care. They can range from really nice and empathetic to completely self absorbed, so they aren't all wonderful.Some people notice, but don't seem to attach too much to it. These are people who will generally be concerned or give advice when you're overweight, which can be annoying but they're mostly trying to objectively help with what they perceive as a problem.The last group is really tough, and unfortunately makes up maybe a quarter to a third of people you meet. These are people who care a lot about appearances, and attach a whole bunch of meaning and psychology to them. So for these people, a beautiful person wearing nice clothes is totally put together and dependable, even if they are actually toxic or a total emotional wreck, for example. For these people, fat = lazy, stupid, slow, whatever negative stereotype you want. These people are sort of like racists, in that they can't stand when a fat person is smarter than them, more well-liked than them, etc, because 'damnit, they're fat so they should be beneath me!' I know that sounds hyperbolic and it sucks, but it's 100% true.Some other things are that people expect you to feel about yourself the way they feel about you, and can be surprised if you're self confident. Another comment in the thread pointed out that many, many overweight people are actually dealing with mental/physical illnesses that either have weight gain as a direct side effect or a side effect of medications. A lot of times these issues are super private, so people would rather take the abuse about their weight than reveal the truth.Overall, the biggest thing you learn from being both fit and overweight is that you're still the same person either way. We attach *so much* to how things appear that has no basis in reality (again reminds me of racism), and I guess many people will only learn once they're on the receiving end of some bullshit prejudice.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 18835, "stickied": false, "score": 85, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 09:15:51 2017", "ups": 85}, {"body": "Food is delicious", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 210860, "stickied": false, "score": 70, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 08:40:20 2017", "ups": 70}, {"body": "That I'm invisible and disgusting ", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 6978, "stickied": false, "score": 62, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 08:33:03 2017", "ups": 62}, {"body": "Overweight people seem to never believe me, but I used to get bullied alot for being a \"toothpick\" in high school.

Back in the bad days there were two different competing standards.  John Dalton first suggested using Hydrogen-1, and set that equal to '1' mass unit.

This was the standard for Chemistry for the early 20th century but unfortunately they didn't know that natural oxygen is a mixture of multiple isotopes, which is a non-trivial flaw.  In the late 50's various scientists decided this was kinda dumb, and an effort was made to standardize. Carbon-12 was chosen, somewhat arbitrarily but it does have a few advantages. It's between those two different measurements so 'no one wins' and also minimizes disruption of all the 'pre-unification' literature.

Peake was indicted on November 17, 2011, and went to trial in January 2012 for two weeks.> > [...] The Department of Justice said the conspiracy occurred during the years 2005 through 2008 and was between Sea Star Line, **Crowley Liner Services Inc. (a subsidiary of Crowley Maritime Corporation)** and Horizon Lines Inc.  Crowley operates large trailer barges in the Puerto Rico trade and several feeder-sized foreign flag containerships from the U.S. Gulf and East Coasts to foreign destinations in the Caribbean.

In addition, in April 2012 forty-six shippers in the Puerto Rico trade brought five overlapping civil actions against the three carriers seeking damages for the overcharging of freight rates, surcharges and other fees.  Thirty-seven shippers brought a single **class action law suit that resulted in the collective payment by the three carriers of $52.3 million**.  Nine major shippers did not join the class action suit but sued the carriers in four separate actions, all of which are pending.> > [...] The separate complaint by the food companies Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and The Kellogg Company named two prominent Jones Act lobbying and support groups \u2013 the Maritime Cabotage Task Force now known as the American Maritime Partnership and the Transportation Institute \u2013 as \u201cco-conspirator industry trade associations.\u201d  It noted that senior executives of Saltchuk, **Crowley** and Horizon were officers of the two organizations, and claimed the Transportation Institute\u2019s Domestic Shipping Council provided executives of the three carriers \u201cwith the cover for additional rump meetings and discussions in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d>> Although several corporate officers from the three carriers were named in the civil suits including **Thomas B.

An undercover FBI agent posing as someone associated with Aryan Nations allegedly recorded McDowell\u2019s statements about wanting to conduct a \u201cbig scale\u201d attack. Mc\u00acDowell, a convicted felon prohibited from owning a firearm, was arrested after allegedly buying a gun from the undercover agent. **2016** **East Kingdom, New Hampshire, January 2016:** An FBI sting operation resulted in the arrest of Daniel Musso and his indictment on four counts of receiving and possessing unregistered explosive devices (grenades).

One would assume Donald Trump would be in that top tier, and that is a substantial tax cut...But that's not what he'd be paying.A bit lower in the 9 page plan, it explains that any earnings from an LLC are going to be taxed at 25%. This is a big deal, because LLC are pass-through entities. Under the current tax system, income generated from an LLC go directly to the owner of the LLC and are taxed at their individual tax rate (up to the max of 39.6%). Under this new GOP plan, that income would go through the LLC direct to the owner, but would only be taxed at 25%.Here's the fun part: Donald Trump's entire empire is held under **The Trump Organization LLC**.Donald Trump owns a shitload of LLCs. He's not running a C-corporation. Every single dollar every single one of Donald Trump's LLCs earn in profit will flow out at a 25% tax rate, massively cutting his own taxes.And of course, he'll take advantage of every single possible loophole to bring his effective rate even lower.The GOP plan caps it all off with one simple little line:\"The framework repeals the death tax and the generation-skipping transfer tax.\"I'll give you three guesses what kind of individual is benefitted by the repeal of the death tax. If it helps you narrow it down, there's about about 5,500 families in the entire US who will directly benefit from the removal of the death tax.Donald Trump standing up there and saying this tax plan won't benefit him isn't just a lie... it's insane. There's no way to read this plan and not see that he's getting a massive break. This is such a bald-faced lie that you have to be willfully ignorant to believe it. The entire POINT of the GOP plan is to reduce taxes on business owners and the wealthy. That's their STATED objective. \"Small businesses drive our economy and our communities, and they deserve a significant tax cut. This framework creates a new tax structure for small businesses so they can better compete. Furthermore, America's outdated tax code has fallen behind the rest of the world - costing U.S. workers both jobs and higher wages. In response, this framework puts America's corporate tax rate below the average of other industrialized countries and promotes greater investment in American manufacturing.\"Is Donald Trump a business owner? Does he run his entire empire through an LLC? Even if you ignore EVERYTHING else, that's unquestionably true. The entire point of this tax plan is to directly benefit people like Donald Trump.

I have had the beyond burger, which is doing a very similar thing, but sells the burgers direct to consumer at places like safeway. It was interesting, but I wouldn\u2019t get them again. First off, they are really expensive. $6 for 2 patties. I would expect the price will come down, but at that price, it\u2019s a novelty. When you open the pack, the smell of metallic cat food is kind of overwhelming. Honestly, I almost threw them out because I thought they were bad. I cooked them in a fry pan, and things got better from there. They take a little longer to cook then regular burgers or other veggie burgers I have had. They brown up nicely on the outside, and where pink on the inside. It was a little different then a regular burger, in that The outside had a layer of brown then pink then brown. Taste wise, they are closer to a regular beef burger then other things that I have tried. I heard one person call it the uncanny valley of food, which was a great description. If you eat it plain, that cat food flavor is just barely present in the back ground. The texture is ok. But, you wouldn\u2019t want to just eat it. Once you put it in a bun and put some condiments on, it becomes edible, and pretty close to a burger. My son thought it was a regular hamburger. My wife is a vegetarian, and she would never eat these, tbh. She is not someone who \u201cmisses the taste of meat\u201d or anything like that.

Although I didn't taste it, I watched one of these \"Impossible\" burgers being cooked at a presentation hosted by the American Chemical Society's research conference in Boston a couple years ago. It's quite the grand - and potentially transformative - challenge that they've undertaken, trying to replace meat, since it so widely influences our environment (deforestation, emissions, pollution, etc...), yet being such an beloved part of many diets, the \"replacements\" often fall short. This is from one of their [patents](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2015153666A1?cl=en), describing the challenge:> Meat substitute compositions typically are extruded soy/grain mixtures that fail to replicate the experience of cooking and eating meat. Common limitations of plant-based meat substitute products include a texture and mouth-feel more homogenous than that of equivalent meat products. Furthermore, as these **products must largely be sold precooked, with artificial flavors and aromas pre-incorporated, they fail to replicate the aromas, flavors, and other key features, such as texture and mouth-feel, associated with cooking or cooked meat, and they also may have added off flavors.** As a result, these products mainly appeal to a limited consumer base that is already committed to vegetarianism, but have failed to appeal to the larger consumer segment accustomed to eating meat. It would be useful to have improved plant-based meat substitutes, which better replicate the fibrousness, texture, aromas and flavors of meat during and/or after cooking.The scientific 'trick' here is that the [leghemeglobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leghemoglobin) provides an [porphyrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrin)-bound iron, just like regular [heme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme) porphyrin in hemeglobin. It's not that we necessarily want the taste of that *iron*, but rather during the cooking process, it catalyzes numerous reactions, producing the scents and flavours that cooking meat naturally undergoes. Again, from their patent, edited for readability:> As described herein, the flavoring agents can be flavor precursors, flavor compounds produced from reacting flavor precursors with iron, or flavorings such as extracts [...] or flavor compounds, natural or synthetic. Flavor precursors can react, e.g., with the iron [...], with each other, or with flavorings, upon heating. [...] The flavor and/or aroma profile of the ground meat product can be modulated by the type and concentration of the flavor precursors, the pH of the reaction, the length of cooking, the type and amount of iron complex [...], the temperature of the reaction, and the amount of water activity in the product, among other factors.This avoids the massively complex analytical process of trying to match the olfactory (smell) and sapictive (taste) profiles through the sum effect of a laundry-list of chemical additives. Instead the flavours are largely generated in a process analogous to what already happens with meat: common biomolecules react, catalyzed by the metal compounds present. I think that will help to assuage the [chemophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia) response tendencies in some people, who complain about additives with \"weird\" names.

Even the comments in this thread are disappointing. There's an awful lot of \"the women had a choice/they were paid/they objectified themselves.\"Why are the women in playboy always so young? One, because they're easier to manipulate. When I was 17, I had a 40-yr old boyfriend. I was fully dependent on him, which gave him a lot of power. He used his leverage to get me to do things I didn't want to do. That was my \"choice.\" But now, as a grown woman, I can see him as the manipulative creep preying on young girls that he is/was. Many of Hugh's girlfriends paint a similar picture. Further, his popularization of the playboy lifestyle that uses women as decorative sex objects has done a lot of harm to both men and women. What does it mean when so many men see his empty, self-centered one-sided polyamorous \"relationships\" with piles of vulnerable young women as \"living the dream?\" How is this at all a healthy thing for women to aspire to? And if it's not healthy for women, how is it positive for men to idolize it? Edit: if you're still not convinced, google some of the girlfriends' perspectives on life in that mansion with strict 9pm curfews and required group sex. You can call it quid-pro-quo, but you sure as shit can't call it healthy.

It's *normal* to think about sex at your age, to be curious about the gender/sex you're attracted to, to want to try these things that make you feel good with people who make your stomach flutter and shit like that. You're a normal girl who was assaulted by someone who felt they could hurt you for their own gratification. That doesn't make you a slut, it doesn't make you loose, it doesn't make you a bitch or anything else your attackers may call you.This is not your fault. You only think you could've done more to prevent this because it's already happened, and hindsight is 20/20 as they say, which means basically you only realize all the things you could've done AFTER the fact.

One of the biggest lies that victims are made to believe either intentionally or not is that *people will not believe them because they are not as popular or as important or whatever as their attacker*. Tell what you've told us, complete strangers, to everyone who will listen, and most who can do something. If you go to the police, get a female officer to tell. SOmeone you can be comfortable with, at least enough to file a report without feeling like they may not take you seriously. Also, and this is serious **mention that you think they might 'try to do something' like harm you or discredit you*. Making someone fear for their life is a crime (In the US the crime of Assault and Battery covers this), and I'm sure that's true even in Canada.

You seem decently young, which to me is even worse (though it's not like rape/sexual assault is fun for any victim...). You were curious, *that is normal*. It's *normal* to think about sex at your age, to be curious about the gender/sex you're attracted to, to want to try these things that make you feel good with people who make your stomach flutter and shit like that. You're a normal girl who was assaulted by someone who felt they could hurt you for their own gratification. That doesn't make you a slut, it doesn't make you loose, it doesn't make you a bitch or anything else your attackers may call you.This is not your fault. You only think you could've done more to prevent this because it's already happened, and hindsight is 20/20 as they say, which means basically you only realize all the things you could've done AFTER the fact.

One of the biggest lies that victims are made to believe either intentionally or not is that *people will not believe them because they are not as popular or as important or whatever as their attacker*. Tell what you've told us, complete strangers, to everyone who will listen, and most who can do something. If you go to the police, get a female officer to tell. SOmeone you can be comfortable with, at least enough to file a report without feeling like they may not take you seriously. Also, and this is serious **mention that you think they might 'try to do something' like harm you or discredit you*. Making someone fear for their life is a crime (In the US the crime of Assault and Battery covers this), and I'm sure that's true even in Canada.

I don't want to sound needy, I don't want to come across as looking for attention. But my life has been spiralling out of control. These past three months or so I've been contemplating suicide because I was raped in the summer by a guy who I'll call Max. I had a slight crush on him and I considered my friend him. I was a slut and curious and wanted to try oral sex.Then the day after I was raped, I went to the gym and met a friend who I'll call Gabe. He told me how his one friend hated me and I started to try and I wanted to leave his house. He didn't let me leave his house. He pushed me to tell him I was raped. Now, we are not friends anymore because he got pissed off I kissed a guy at a club. All of his friends seriously hate me. He hates me. They stare at me every where I go. Gabe is telling everyone I'm a fake bitch. He's spreading rumours about me sleeping with guys and mentioned I was raped to people too. A friend of mine told me Gabe was talking and spreading lots of terrible rumours about me.Last week I confronted Max in person about the rape. He told me he remembered me pushing him off of me and saying no. Then he told me if I remembered when he asked me if he could and I said yes. That never happened. He never asked, he just did it. He kept asking me what's going to happen and what i was trying to say. Now today through text he is denying it that I pushed him off. He's saying I wanted it. I didn't want it.I'm not sure what to do next. I went everywhere I could. Talked to my friends, talked to Student Services at my school, I'm going to talk to a counsellor, I went to Sexual Assault Clinic. I really messed my life up. Max is on the soccer team at my school. Everyone knows him. Everyone loves him. I'm just an average girl. Who no one knows. So who will people believe? A miss nobody? or a Mr. somebody? I will loose all of my dear male friends. They'll hate me too. I never remotely did anything sexual. I was a virgin and he ripped it from me. I'm dead. From everything. From Gabe taunting me, his friends whispering about me, to Max denying he raped me, to me hating myself for never going to the Hospital after he raped me. God I hate myself. Why was I even born? Things have gotten even worse for me. I'm not sure what to do. I saw Max and Gabe together often this week. I feel that they are conspiring something against me. Gabe knows I was raped, and Max now knows I considered what he did to me as rape. Word spreads fast and I am sure the two stories collided. I don't know what to do. I can't go to the police because they can't do anything for me. I didn't get a rape kit done because I was dead and mortified. I have no physical proof of the rape happening. It'll be his word against mine. He makes it sound like I'm regretting having sex with him and now I'm the girl who's crying rape. Please, these dark thoughts have been gathering in my mind for a long time. I can't tell my friends about it because I know they'll tell my parents or someone else I know.

I remember having to miss days of school because my pain was so bad. It got *slightly* better when I started taking hormonal birth control. I was on HBC from about age 16 until last year, when I was diagnosed with a [benign hepatic hemangioma](http://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/benigntumors/). When I got the surgery, I was told in the post-op that I had uterine fibroids. This was in addition to having ovarian cysts, caused by HBC. I have had 2 emergency surgeries to stop internal bleeding caused by cysts bursting. Since there is no risk of me ever getting pregnant, my obgyn advised that I stop taking HBC. Ever since I stopped, my menstrual pain has been nearly unbearable, maybe around an 8 or 9 on the pain scale. I have to take the first 2-3 days of my cycle off of work. I also go through about 10 to 12 super tampons a day, and that still doesn't prevent me from soiling my clothes and bedsheets. I've been trying to get a hysterectomy since I was 18, and 2 days ago my obgyn said he would do it!! He said I would have to keep my ovaries because I'm too young for menopause, but at least my uterus will be gone!! As soon as i told my mom, she told me to try a D&C first, or an IUD. I get that as my mom, she's worried, but why would I want to go through two painful procedures that aren't guaranteed to work, when I could instead go through one painful procedure that will absolutely work? My friends say that surgery and anesthesia are very risky and I shouldn't do something so drastic until I've exhausted all other options. I actually understand where they are coming from,  surgery is always risky, but in my mind, I *have* exhausted all of the options that I'm willing to try. (there's one friend who thinks it's a good idea, because she had similar pain until she got her hysterectomy.) The only other person who supports my decision is my boyfriend. To be fair, he's the only one that has seen the extent of what I go through. He's the one that's had to rub my back for an hour so I can fall asleep, and the one that's had to scrub the blood out of the bedsheets because I can't stand up to clean them myself. To be honest I'm fucking sick of people telling me what to do with my body. They don't know what I experience, they don't know how bad it gets. I'm tired of having to tell people that it's not their choice to make. I guess I just expected a little more support from the people that claim to care about my well-being.

I am posting here in the hopes that one of you (maybe with similar experience) can give me some advice.I have known my best friend since we were 4.  We are now 20 / 21 and juniors in college.  I have a history of depression but am doing much better recently, she has a history of anxiety.  Our schools are about an hour away from each other.  She has other friends but they are mainly assholes (narcissistic, don't stick by her when the going gets tough) so she leans on me a lot.Her dad was a good, good man.  Funny and loving.  Not a mean bone in his body.  I loved him - everyone in his life did.  He was, as I learned only recently, an alcoholic.  Over the past three years he went in and out of rehab, got divorced from her mom, lost his job, moved back in with his parents.  Her mom is not the easiest person to deal with, and her dad was her only real source of support in that regard.  Though she lived with her mom, she and her dad shared an incredible, unbreakable bond.He committed suicide about a week ago.  I was in shock.  I thought things were getting better for him.  At first, she seemed to be doing *really* well.  She said she was very sad but that she still felt like herself.  She is religious and said that she was confident she would see him again some day soon.  We have been talking most every day since - lots of ups and downs.Today she called me and was a complete wreck.  She said she was furious at him for killing himself and that he was an asshole.  I did not agree with her but reminded her her emotions were valid.  She was crying, which made me cry.  She said she isn't eating or sleeping and that her friends aren't helpful.  She asked a few of them not to come to the burial service this Saturday (she only wanted me and one other person there) which I think pissed a lot of them off.She is scared she will never feel whole again.  That her family, when she has one, won't be whole the way her childhood family was.  She is seeing a psychiatrist already but she doesn't seem that helpful.  Her friends seem to be abandoning her.I don't know what to do because I am not emotionally equipped to bear this whole burden on my own.  I have my own supports and am no longer depressed as I once was, but this is taking a toll on me.  I am torn and miserable because I *absolutely positively refuse* to abandon her the way her other friends have.  At the same time, this is a really, really hard situation which is dragging me back to a place I have not been in a while.For those of you who have gone through something similar (either in my or my friend's shoes,) I have a few questions:1. What kinds of things should I be saying when she is sad or when she is angry?2. I want to tell her she will be whole again, I have been telling her that, but I don't know it for sure.  How can I console her without making stupid empty promises I can't in any way know the answers to?3. How do I be there for her while still taking care of myself?  I will *absolutely never* abandon her, but this is really, really, really hard and the formerly depressed side of me, to be honest, has definitely thought about it.Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.Edit: Looks like I failed to keep it brief - I am sorry.

I made my decision and I'll be sticking to it. Now, the state I live in has gone out of way to take away a woman's right to choose and I'm surrounded by states with similar views, which makes access tricky. I live no where near a provider and it requires multiple visits. But, I've got all the logistics and appoints made. In the meantime, the hormones have kicked into overdrive. I ended up telling the other party, even though I never really intended to. I was going through an emotional overload. I got more news I didn't want to hear today and I guess I was either trying to make him feel what I was going through in that moment or maybe I was looking for a little support. We had the \"what if\" discussion before, so I knew he his reaction wouldn't be good. I wouldn't want it to be good. I didn't even expect it to be nice. But now that I think about how he reacted, it actually seems cruel. The problem is, those damn hormones. I don't know if he was really being cruel or if I'm overreacting. First, there was the stupid, childish thing he did. He blocked me on Facebook. But somehow, when he did it, he also sent a friend request, which he withdrew after I got it. That was stupid and childish, but whatever. My first reaction wasn't all that great either. Unfortunately, I sent him a text asking about the friend request before I realized what was going on, which led to us talking. He told me that he didn't want to hear about any of this. That if I decided to have the kid, he wouldn't be involved and he wouldn't help in any way. Then he threw in that he'd be down for some sex though.Like I said, my initial reaction was pretty bad. I decided to run one of the trails near my house, stopped about halfway through, then laid in the woods crying until it started getting dark and went back to my house and drank wine straight out of the bottle while I was in the shower washing the wilderness out of my hair. So, by comparison, it's not all that bad. Plus I pretty much FEEL the same way. I don't want to know about any of this. I don't want any part in raising another kid. And, thanks to the hormones, I could really go for sex more often than not. Plus I was prepared for a less than enthusiastic reaction. But now that I've thought about it, it seems cruel. Sure, I FEEL the same way. But I wouldn't tell a pregnant woman that. Especially one that was crying at the time. That's just the way it feels to me. There is a small chance I may be blowing things out of proportion though. Yesterday at the grocery store, a lady took the last loaf of fresh garlic bread from the display and I was suddenly pretty sure I was willing to murder her over it. Keep in mind, I wasn't at the display when she took it so she had no idea I might have possibly even wanted it. I didn't go to the store with any intention of buying garlic bread and I really didn't want any until she took the last one. So, if you've made it this far, you now know what it's like inside the mind of a pregnant woman. Unfocused, rambling and often incoherent. Honestly, I cut this down by over half before posting, there's a lot going on in my head right now. But thanks for sticking around, I actually do have a question. Is it really to much to expect a little support? Even if he has to fake it? If I'm irrationally pissed off at him for no reason other than the fact that he is 50% responsible for this situation (even if he doesn't think so), should't I be allowed to call and bitch for a minute? When the hormones really start getting the better of me and reminding me of all of the reasons I really could raise another child if I wanted to, shouldn't I be able to expect a little help through it? It eventually subsides after reminding myself of all the reasons I don't want another kid, but it would help to have someone else to talk it through with.

I promise you she probably knows it's true but won't ruin the life she has built with him over it. I blamed myself for a long time too, justified it, told myself I wasn't remembering all those memories right, told myself it wasn't wrong, it wasn't really that bad. It was all lies.

My father is not my birth father. I actually have no father on my birth certificate. Just my mom. My mother is a wonderful woman. She is strong, willful, bright, an all around beautiful person. She got pregnant with me in her senior year of high school, and proceeded to give me a wonderful life. She met my Stepfather when I was only a year old, and they married within six months. Truly I have never seen a couple more in love and dedicated to one another.My step dad, we'll just call him B, worked hard to give us the life we deserved. He gave my mother to more amazing kids, my sister and brother. I love them with all my heart.I, however, hate myself. I've suffered from depression and anxiety from a young age. It's been a long, hard road, and it's been lonely. The reason I hate myself is B.Now, don't get me wrong, I appreciate everything B has given my family. A roof over our heads, food on the table, wonderful vacations. We had it all. We even adopted some kids, and now I have one more sister and two more little brothers.But it started when I was young. Maybe seven. The touching. B would touch me in places I didn't know were wrong at the time, down my panties, on my bum. I didn't know any better. It progressed as I got older. Once I blossomed and got breasts, his attentions went there as well. At one point he told me o had to remove my own pants of I wanted it to go further.My own stepfather, the one I counted on to protect me...That was when I was fourteen, in high school. I'd worked through this so many times in my head, and I finally told my mom, hoping she would help.She didn't believe me, B lied about it all.She even questioned me.\"He didn't do anything to your sister, why would he do anything to you?\"I pretended it never happened, but I started looking for love in all the wrong places. I was angry, I was hurt. I had sex with anyone who would look at me. Anyone who would whisper sweet nothing's to me. I was sixteen.I was in my junior year of high school.I hated myself.Did I make it up? Was it a continuous nightmare I couldn't wake from? My hate became scars on my arms and legs.Why would he lie? Didn't B care at all how I felt?I kept my mouth shut, and eventually the memories buried themselves deep down in my brain until I shut them out.But one night, at two AM, they emerged again and I was  a mess. I was a sobbing, shaking, crying mess because I finally knew it was wrong. What he did was wrong. And I would be forever scarred from it.I couldn't focus in school the next day, I broke down in my computer class. I wanted to die.I called my mom and asked her to meet me at a restaurant in town, only her.I told her again, much calmer this time, about what happened between B and I.She was angry.At me.Again, B denied it.Again, she believed him.What sucks? I've forgiven him. In my heart, I've forgiven him for everything he had done. I can't change him. I know I could try, but I can't. I've forgiven someone who has never given me an apology.I'm posting in here because I need to know someone, somewhere is listening... that what happened to me actually happened. That I'm not lying and that I'm broken and sad and depressed but I forgive him and I just want to move on.

However, there is one part of my past that I'm still hanging on to, and it's negatively impacting our physical relationship.I've had some shitty relationships and have gone through verbal and physical abuse. For the past 7 years, I've been at war with myself. I want sex, so I find someone. After a few months, I have a flashback or I start to get panic attacks when engaging in intimacy. I avoid it, leave the person, and start all over again. But now I'm in a serious relationship.I'm realizing this issue will never go away. I need to make peace with my past, but it's so much easier said than done. One of the worst days of my life was when I experienced a flashback while being intimidate with my SO. Once my subconscious made that connection, I feel like everything has been screwed up.When he mentions sex, or tries to initiate, my heartrate rises and I get defensive and throw out accusations. There is this voice in my head saying \"he only wants you for your body,\" etc. Sometimes I'll burst into tears when I feel the pressure is too much. From his perspective, we can't even discuss it without me crying or panicking.I've gone to talk therapy. I didn't get much out of it. I'm so scared that this will never get better. On the rare occasions that I am feeling up to trying something, I feel \"dirty\" and upset when we are done. Sex is incredibly painful as well. I can feel my vaginal muscles clenching in protest.Sex is a wonderful thing that I'd like to share with my SO, but for me it's not that wonderful. It's hell. I know I have to \"retrain my brain\" to not panic. My SO also works with me - he'll talk to me and go only up to the limits I set. But I feel like nothing is working, especially after years of trying.TLDR: I have flashbacks and PTSD experiences with my SO during sex and don't know what to do.Does anyone have experience with this?

This is the first time, however, that scientists have been able to account for changes from subtle natural and human-caused losses (degradation and disturbance) such as small-scale tree removal and mortality while also measuring gains from forest growth.The paper will be published online in the journal Science on Thursday, 28 September 2017.The findings by a team of scientists at the Woods Hole Research Center and Boston University add new urgency to the critical need for aggressive global and national-scale efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.

Forests are the only carbon capture and storage 'technology' we have in our grasp that is safe, proven, inexpensive, immediately available at scale, and capable of providing beneficial ripple effects\u2014from regulating rainfall patterns to providing livelihoods to indigenous communities.\"Using 12 years (2003-2014) of satellite imagery, laser remote sensing technology and field measurements, Baccini and his team were able to capture losses in forest carbon from wholesale deforestation as well as from more difficult-to-measure fine-scale degradation and disturbance, which has previously proven a challenge to the scientific community over large areas.\"It can be a challenge to map the forests that have been completely lost,\" said WHRC scientist Wayne Walker, one of the report's authors. \"However, it's even more difficult to measure small and more subtle losses of forest. In many cases throughout the tropics you have selective logging, or smallholder farmers removing individual trees for fuel wood. These losses can be relatively small in any one place, but added up across large areas they become considerable.\"Using this new capability, the researchers discovered that tropical regions are a net source of carbon to the atmosphere\u2014about 425 teragrams of carbon annually, which is more than the emissions from all cars and trucks in the United States. Gross annual losses were about 862 teragrams of carbon and while gains were approximately 437 teragrams of carbon.Losses and gains of carbon are not evenly distributed across the tropical belt, the report finds. On a continental scale, the majority of the loss (nearly 60 percent) occurred in Latin America, home to the Amazon\u2014the world's largest remaining intact rainforest. Nearly 24 percent of the loss is attributable to Africa while the forests of Asia experienced the least losses\u2014a little more than 16 percent of the tropical total.Just as most of the forest loss took place in the Americas, so, too did most of the forest gain. Nearly 43 percent of the tropical gain is attributable to the Americas. A little more than 30 percent was gained in Africa; about 26 percent was gained in Asia.The research showed that with the exception of Asia, degradation and disturbance were responsible for the majority of continental losses. In the Americas, 70 percent of losses were due to degradation and disturbance; in Africa, it was 81 percent. Less than half\u201446 percent\u2014of losses in Asia are linked to degradation and disturbance.As governments around the world develop plans to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement, the study shows the enormous potential of tropical forests as a climate change mitigation tool. The authors note that ending tropical deforestation and forest degradation would reduce annual emissions by at least 862 teragrams of carbon, or about 8% of annual global emissions.The United Nations' REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program provides incentives for countries to maintain forests intact. However, the program necessarily depends on regular access to accurate measurements of incremental gains and losses in forest carbon density.\"With this study, countries are now able not only to identify where degradation is taking place, but also, given the potential to now measure gains from growth, they can demonstrate their contribution to returning tropical forests to their more beneficial role as a carbon sink,\" Baccini said. \"We envision this tool improving the way countries across the tropics tackle the challenges of deforestation and degradation.\"", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 13851, "stickied": false, "score": 17, "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 00:45:29 2017", "ups": 17}, {"body": "Ranger Rick has to be a really fucked magazine.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 0, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 02:41:22 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Not my problem -baby boomers", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 20, "stickied": false, "score": 9, "submission_time": "Fri Sep 29 03:02:35 2017", "ups": 9}, {"body": "So basically.

My grandfather subscribed to playboy for decades.  When he was in his late 80's they upped the price quite a bit and he cancelled it.  Some poor woman called him to ask why he had cancelled, pointing out to him that the price may have gone up, but now he'd get a few videos included.  He told her that he was 80 something years old, had been getting the magazine for 40 years and at his age, he really did just read it for the articles and he didn't give a damn about any dirty videos.  She must have looked at his account and realized how old he was because she dropped the price back down to what he'd been paying.Then when i was in college, i'd come home to visit and before I left he'd call me over, slip me twenty bucks and some of those magazines in a bag telling me to bring them to my guy friends at school.  That may seem a little weird - giving porn to your granddaughter to give to her guy friends - but if you knew him you'd realize it was a good deed on his part - figuring my friends couldn't afford to buy their own.  Then again maybe he figured if they were busy with those they'd leave his granddaughter alone. LOLIn the last month of his life he was in a nursing home and showing signs of dementia.  I was going to visit him and wanted to bring him something but couldn't figure out what.  My uncle went into his attic and pulled out some old playboys from the 70's and gave them to me to bring to grandpa.  Some may think this is weird but i remember the smile on his face when he pulled them out of the bag.  He didn't know where he was or why he was there but those magazines he knew.  Was the last time I saw him alive and I'm glad that brought a smile to his face.  EDIT - since you are enjoying my memory of Grandpa - I should show you what a badass he was.  Here he is delivering milk in a flood in Lowell MA [My Grandpa - Gordon Cutler is the one standing](https://i.imgur.com/Da0nFVo.jpg)EDIT 2:  I appreciate and am overwhelmed by all the gildings.

If somebody from the US or another major world power dies in their custody, the potential repercussions are far too harsh for them to risk subjecting foreign prisoners to the same level of physical abuse they force upon their own people.Don't get me wrong; there are still stories of beatings, labor, and especially mental abuse coming out of North Korea from Americans who have been imprisoned there. But in recent years especially, North Korea has repeatedly sentenced foreign visitors to decades of labor and released them after around a month of relatively humane treatment.The government of North Korea wants to look tough, but they don't have the military might or political capital to pull it off and so they bluster in public and cower in private. They act like they aren't scared of the consequences of imprisoning and torturing an American citizen, but in reality that couldn't be further from the truth.The Otto Warmbier case is unusual, but the accusations of torture and abuse are difficult to prove. The Warmbier family and the coroner disagree on important details&mdash;notably Mr. Warmbier's description severe disfigurement of his bottom teeth which the coroner describes as in normal condition. The Warmbiers accuse North Korea of torture, but the coroner failed to find any evidence of fractures or injuries consistent with physical torture from scans.Given North Korea's typical treatment of American prisoners and the evidence the coroner has provided, the most likely explanation is that Otto's health began declining and, when the government saw his death as likely, he was shipped back to the United States so that North Korea didn't need to worry about the consequences of having a dead American on their soil (especially given the current political tension). The Warmbiers, justifiably angry at the treatment of their son, began unloading at North Korea with an exaggerated version of the truth, trying to instill the same anger and grief they feel over the death of their son in anybody who will listen.TL;DR NK is a bunch of pussies and didn't want a dead American on their hands, Warmbiers spouted a lot of hatred against NK out of grief and anger---**-=| SOURCES |=-***NK treatment of American prisoners*https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/19/north-korean-treatment-western-prisoners-bizarre-not-always-physically-brutal/103022748/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/world/asia/north-korea-otto-warmbier-.html?mcubz=3*Otto's condition*http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/27/otto-warmbiers-body-showed-no-signs-torture-coroners-reports-says.htmlhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/otto-warmbier-coroner-report-torture_us_59cbfb34e4b02aef6cd719b5https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/09/27/world/asia/27reuters-usa-northkorea-detainee.html?mcubz=3", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 948, "stickied": false, "score": 101, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 19:03:28 2017", "ups": 101}], "stickied": false, "title": "U.S. student held in North Korea died of oxygen starved brain: coroner", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-northkorea-detainee/u-s-student-held-in-north-korea-died-of-oxygen-starved-brain-coroner-idUSKCN1C22XM", "num_comments": 862, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 13:52:32 2017", "contest_mode": false, "subreddit": "news", "pinned": false, "permalink": "/r/news/comments/72z2pt/us_student_held_in_north_korea_died_of_oxygen/", "score": 4546, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "over_18": false, "selftext": "", "id": "72z2pt", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 3098, "gilded": 0, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "As if a 6-year-old knows why they're kneeling and isn't doing it because their parents told them to", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 50023, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Thu Sep 28 17:50:08 2017", "ups": 5}, {"body": "As a grown man I extremely respect that kid.

The parents of the cadet candidates havebeen contacted and Security Forces are investigating the incident.  In themeantime, Col Redacted has addressed students and permanent party at the PrepSchool, and has engaged with our Chief Diversity Officer to initiatefacilitated small group discussions with the cadet candidates as theinvestigation continues. Photos of the message boards were sent to some ofthe parents by the cadet candidates, and the photos have begun to appear insocial media.It is important to understand that concepts like Respect and Dignity are notnegotiable. They are central to our culture, and absolutely critical toleadership in today's Air Force.  That's the SUPTs and my red line, and itwill NOT be crossed. I know you share the same red line, but incidents suchas this serve as a reminder that we must continue to keep the conversationson these issues alive on our campus.  On that note, I would like to applaudthe Monday evening \"Critical Conversations\" event the Dean hosted where 145cadets and faculty attended to discuss current events, including race atUSAFA. We've all seen the ongoing controversy in the NFL and witnessed the falloutsince the riots and violence in Charlottesville, and we know theconversations that are happening in our society and in social media. I wouldlike us all to be engaging in these tough conversations, in a civil mannerthat spurs more discussion and reaches productive solutions. To that end andto be clear: do not avoid the topic. I expect you to have conversations withrespect and dignity. The discourse is how we grow and how we develop asfuture officers.Each year, 1,200 new cadets join us from around the country and across theworld, alongside the 200+ cadet candidates at the Prep School. But once wearrive here and get immersed in the Air Force culture, it must be absolutelyclear how we look out for and respect one another. This isn't about one incident at the prep school - it is about ensuring ourmessage is clear regarding the way we treat one another, every single day.Thank you for your leadership, for your active engagement, and for yourownership of the culture we foster at this Academy.
