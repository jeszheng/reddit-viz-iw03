The level of care the average resident factors into it as well, since the person who only needs help dressing, showering, and med reminders will take less time than the person that can't go to the toilet alone or move themselves in bed. I can't give you a number because it varies by the independence level of the residents. Look at the state averages and comparable facilities.* If your parent is with similarly abled people, it will be more even care. * If the aides all have CNA certifications, that's good. * If an LPN or RN directly does the pills- not done by aides under their direction- can be done, but nurses will be better and if aides are doing that and personal cares, they're going to be busy and distracted. * If there's housekeeping that brings them water and cleans, that frees up the CNAs to do personal cares. Your parent won't be getting dressed, showered or changed by a nurse the large majority of the time, their time is expensive.* How many standing or hoyer lifts does each area have? How many residents on that hall need a lift? If it's short, they have to wait. I'm certain that people have just picked up lighter residents that should have a lift, but that's super illegal. Might be quicker and more comfortable for the resident, but they risk getting badly hurt.* How long have the workers been there? If it's mostly <6months and a couple lifers, not good. It's high turnover, but higher turnover than other places is a bad sign. If it's stressful and low paid enough, they'll have trouble keeping the best workers unless they're really dedicated to the residents. Oh, if everybody that works there smokes, bad sign, in my opinion. (sign of overstretched staff)If your parent just needs help occasionally, most of this doesn't apply, this is for nursing home and memory care more than assisted living, but assisted living gets to be a pretty wide spectrum. Ask about their call-in policy- what do they do when someone doesn't show up? Do they have a plan to fill the shift, or are they short staffed that day? Are there policies to prevent workers from coming in sick? Do they do flu vaccinations in-house? Check to see if residents are shaven and hair is mostly combed, it's a good indicator of whether aides rush and do the minimum, or take time with the residents.I was a CNA, so probably biased, but pretty hands on. One place I worked was ~20 residents/2 aides and half the aides were doing meds, which took up a lot of their time. They were assigned to the more independent residents, but still... Know someone who regularly does 40 residents/2 aides on a hall when there's a call out. They have housekeepers that pass water and separate med aides, but most of the residents don't walk or transfer themselves.

For years Jim would call me at all hours saying how much he missed the hippie because she would just walk into his house and sleep with him. So he ended up ruining most of his relationships with other girls. But when he finally let the hippie go, she tried to stab him with a kitchen knife. I'm still friends with Jim but the hippie girl, she was my ex best friend. She also slept with my ex boyfriends as well. So she was never a good person.

Soon enough ellie\u2019s Other friends and a few of my own friends who knew her too were spending a bit less time with me or weren\u2019t as willing to listen when I told them I thought Ellie was behind it.A few months more of this and a few traps laid (like posts only Ellie knew the URL to, but she didn\u2019t know that, getting abusive anonymous posts) showed it was definitely her. I went nuclear, posted about it all publicly and lost a lot of friends in the process. Nobody wanted to believe Ellie was anything but the beautiful and loving front she presented. Found out just this year that Ellie was caught and jailed for interfering with one of her friend\u2019s children.

For example, a microstate of a classical ideal gas is specified by the positions and momenta of all the atoms, which range continuously over the real numbers. If we want to define \u03a9, we have to come up with a method of grouping the microstates together to obtain a countable set. This procedure is known as coarse graining.

As nicely laid out in this [Scientific American article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/critical-opalescence/what-happens-to-google-maps-when-tectonic-plates-move/), these two coordinate systems have different references. For NAD83, coordinates are tied to the North American plate so for the majority of the US (the portion of California on the Pacific plate would be an exception) coordinates move with the North American plate so do not change as a function of long-term plate motion (but could still change due to local tectonic effects not accounted for in the reference frame). For WGS84, the reference system is based on the Earth's center of mass and is not tied to any particular plate so the coordinates for locations change through time (i.e. the angular and distance relations between two coordinates do not change, so if the angular and distance relations between two points on land change, this means that they have new coordinates). As a consequence (and as illustrated in the Sci Am article) this means there is a gradual increasing disagreement between NAD83 coordinates and WGS84 in the US.As described in some level of technical detail in this set of [lecture slides](http://www.naref.org/transf/nad83_hydroscan2006.pdf), these days most coordinate systems are tied to the [International Terrestrial Reference Frame](http://itrf.ign.fr/general.php), which is a combination of a lot of things, but includes a regularly updated estimate of the location of the Earth's center of mass (for reference systems which use this as their zero point) and plate motion models so that one can specify a time and get a coordinate. As you can also see if you dig into those slides enough, both WGS84 and NAD83 have been updated periodically to account for changes, for WGS84 changing approximations of the Earth's center of mass mean slight changes in the coordinates and for NAD83, I think the big change was just a way to transform between NAD83 coordinates and ITRF based coordinates. Now, a related question might be, for the average person, does this matter? Probably not. If you were to measure your position with a handheld GPS in WGS84 coordinates (internally they all are using WGS84, if you have it display the coordinates in something else, it's doing a conversion anyway) at the exact same spot year after year, theoretically the coordinates would change, but in practice, using consumer grade GPS receivers, your position is never accurate enough for this to matter.

The exception might be in the case of rapid changes in location, like extreme surface deformation associated with an earthquake. Say, if you had driven a spike into the ground right next to a fault and measured your location in WGS84 and then an earthquake happened and there was 10 meters of motion on the fault at the surface and you then remeasured your location, you might see a change in your coordinates, again depending on the accuracy of your GPS receiver.

I was deeply inspired, as I had been on our trips to Texas, Louisiana and Florida to see the people in need and those tending to them. We are making progress. In Puerto Rico, urban search and rescue teams have covered 100% of the island, searched more than 2,600 structures, saved or assisted more than 840 individuals, and are continuing efforts. Power is being restored to hospitals, and all hospital assessments are complete. 59 hospitals are partially operational, either caring for the patients they have, or receiving patients. One hospital is fully operational. Drinking water is being restored. 45% of customers in Puerto Rico have access to drinking water. Stores are opening. 49% of grocery and big box stores are open in Puerto Rico. Nearly 700 retail gas stations are operating (with limitations). Food and water continues to be delivered and distributed. Puerto Rico established 11 regional staging areas around the island. Luis Munoz Marin International airport (SJU) three miles southeast of San Juan is accommodating daily commercial flights.Lack of power and the persistent commodity distribution problems on the island are major focuses right now. This is still an urgent situation.An EOP update call is scheduled for 3:00 pm today after the 12:30 FEMA call. Doug Fears will coordinate. These calls will continue throughout this week. And, thanks to the intervention of General Kelly, who made a personal phone call, John Daly will extend his service at the White House as Deputy Homeland Security Advisor for another couple weeks. Thank God!I hope to turn the corner on our public communications and want to thank Hope and Jessica Ditto and Mercy and Sarah Sanders for all that they and their team are doing. Jessica is working today with DHS to put together a multi-department external affairs plan, with multiple Secretaries, me, Brock, and Mick with coordinated general and specific Puerto Rico themes and department level details. I recommend that today and tomorrow we use the general theme of supporting the governor and standing with the people of Puerto Rico to get them food, water, shelter and emergency medical care. Monday and Tuesday we can pivot hopefully to a theme of stabilizing as we address temporary housing and sustaining the flow of commodities and basic government services, including temporary power. After that we focus on restoration of basic services throughout next week and next weekend. Then we start a theme of recovery planning for the bright future that lies ahead for Puerto Rico. Planned hits, tweets, tv bookings and other work will limit the need for reactionary efforts.The storm caused these problems, not our response to it. We have pushed about as much stuff and people through a tiny hole in as short a timeframe as possible.We will continue to support Governor Rossello, help Elaine Duke and Brock Long, and keep focused on the needs of the survivors. We have a strong ground game in place on the island with military leadership. Rossello should continue to get more public messaging support from us. His daily 8:00 am press conference on Puerto Rico is the definitive source for new updates.Say a prayer for those who died and those sleeping in shelters and in badly damaged homes today. Get some rest yourself if you can, and remember to rededicate yourself to this effort.The President's visit Tuesday will inspire the people and let them know we all care.In mid October, Mick and Marc will lead the effort to the Hill for more funds for emergency work, recovery programs and other offsets, and to replenish and hopefully reform the flood insurance program. In the meantime, we have plenty of ready money and another $6+ billion will be released to FEMA October 1st as part of our last supplemental deal.Thank you, keep it up!You people are actually fucking sickening, how you go through this memo and pick out the SINGLE sentence that can be picked out and quoted to mis represent the whole letter.You people make me fucking sick.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 9394, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  2 03:24:59 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Can we pinpoint the time this sub began viewing the government as father, mother, and provider?", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": -51, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  2 02:42:33 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "This is fake news!

The cycle seems to be:Republican administration comes in, America declines (Bush), Dem's are elected, slow progress is made (Obama), Americans are dissatisfied with progress, we go back to Republicans (Trump), we decline some more, and we'll switch back (hopefully...) to Dem's in 2018/20. Would not surprise me at all to go back to R after that. Edit- I forgot, a lot seem to support Trump based on a couple things (strong supporter of 2nd amendment, abortion, anti-immigration, anti-hand outs, lower taxes, anti-PC, etc.) As long as the thing they voted for him is getting done (whether it actually is doesn't matter, they just have to think it's getting done), they'll tune out all the bad stuff about Trump.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 8737, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Sun Oct  1 23:24:15 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "- insane- sociopathic- nazi- cultish- sexist- easy mark for con menPick as many as apply...", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 91891, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Sun Oct  1 21:44:59 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "trump voters would cheer armageddon.

If you don't know what to say, you will get a message on Battle for the Net on what to say to them or you can just make up your own sentences for example like this: > Ajit Pai should no longer be the chairman of the FCC because of his corporate stands against everyone in the USA. He was previously a lawyer for Verizon and became a favorite among them because he always looks for loophole in our current laws and finds a way around them. He wants to make the internet more expensive and inaccessible to people living in poor areas. If he continues to be the Chairman then he will do nothing but screw everyone else over while only benefits Comcast and Verzion. I also need the internet to help me with my future careers and for keeping me and my family entertained. The internet is a tool that everyone needs to use everyday. He should not be allowed to be part of government because he is only there to hurt everyone instead of supporting them. Every vote for him is a vote against everyone else in America.Shout out to [/u/jdtabish](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/739ta4/48_hours_left_to_help_get_fcc_chairman_ajit_pai/) and [Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/senator-launches-opposition-to-ajit-pais-fcc-re-confirmation/) for the info.If I made any mistakes, feel free to help me correct this.", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "over_18": false, "submission_time": "Sun Oct  1 07:44:49 2017", "id": "73jj49", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 8223, "gilded": 0, "controversial_comments": [{"body": ">  \"her husband doesn't even know how to do illegal downloads\"Of course not...

Few things: > This is where the distinction between algorithms and human judgment becomes crucial. A search engine query can quickly tell you a lot about VLC, its history, a few of the major players, and some published research in the field. But to make a business decision about whether to invest tens of millions of dollars in developing and marketing VLC products....The author of this article is conflating two very disparate things: AI and a Search Engine. They are **NOT** the same. Yes, an AI will utilize a search engine. Watson was formed to basically solve Jeopardy questions using data stores. But that's not the point. The point is that an AI will form hypotheses to the input it is given. This is called Confidence Level (as they relate to SemNet and NLP but that's another story). Current AI will form hypotheses and keep history of failed ones. This is sometimes referred to as Machine Learning at the 20,000 foot overview level. A search engine on its own doesn't do that. It just takes input and searches for relative data. But an AI is supposed to learn and store and keep testing. The thing is, the AI can only operate on what is currently known. It will never try things that would be considered \"Outside The Box\" because of confidence levels. It will never try a solution that has failed 0% of the time on all things even though it might actually be the answer to the problem right in front of it.

Few things: > This is where the distinction between algorithms and human judgment becomes crucial. A search engine query can quickly tell you a lot about VLC, its history, a few of the major players, and some published research in the field. But to make a business decision about whether to invest tens of millions of dollars in developing and marketing VLC products....The author of this article is conflating two very disparate things: AI and a Search Engine. They are **NOT** the same. Yes, an AI will utilize a search engine. Watson was formed to basically solve Jeopardy questions using data stores. But that's not the point. The point is that an AI will form hypotheses to the input it is given. This is called Confidence Level (as they relate to SemNet and NLP but that's another story). Current AI will form hypotheses and keep history of failed ones. This is sometimes referred to as Machine Learning at the 20,000 foot overview level. A search engine on its own doesn't do that. It just takes input and searches for relative data. But an AI is supposed to learn and store and keep testing. The thing is, the AI can only operate on what is currently known. It will never try things that would be considered \"Outside The Box\" because of confidence levels. It will never try a solution that has failed 0% of the time on all things even though it might actually be the answer to the problem right in front of it. It's not capable of abstraction to that level (yet). So yeah...

Your effort to argue for what you believe is right in the name of your religion is often startlingly unlike your leader. Maybe put down the sign that says, \"you're going to hell!\" And talk to the people you want to \"help.\" Ask them what they need.

We were fighting in the car on the ride over, and continued arguing when we got to the restaurant and parked. I was trying so hard to make everything better.

I took a few minutes to try to compose myself, then went in.I had a hard time finding the family, and as I was walking around a woman heading out stopped me and asked if she could hug me.

For some reason a friend told me to try sales at his dealership.Sales is a pretty hard job. You have to convince a person or group of people to purchase an expensive piece of property that they're going to finance for years to come. Well I work primarily with guys and I get told the same thing all the time:\"Stop trying to help people and send them to whoever they need to talk to.\"But that's not my style; I want the customer to feel they are getting some service instead of being passed around, which leads into this afternoon.A man and his wife were looking at cars around the back of the lot where new trades would be. Their salesperson was unavailable, and they were walking to an employee only area. Salespeople kept trying to talk to them and they turned them away. I decided to go over and simply told them \"Excuse me, you're heading to the employee lot.\" The man looked at me and said \"Would you show me these cars that [salesman] told me about?\"I told him that I would rather tell his manager, that way he could be informed who deserves the deal. The manager was going to take care of it, but the couple said they wanted me to help; that they trusted me.Well a salesman that kept pestering them got mad that they chose me to help them. After we found a car they like, we pulled up to the front. When he saw me he yelled really loud:\"Jeri's a skater! Jeri's a skater!\"A skater is a person that deliberately jumps on another person's customer. He was saying that I took the customer away from the original salesperson! I bit my lip and and tried to ignore him, but the man asked me who he was talking about. I very quietly whispered me, but it was okay.Well, the lady didn't think so. She got out of the car, went straight to the man and tell him to leave me alone! Then she and her husband pulled our manager and explained how disrespectful he was being and how they were not impressed with the dealership. They reasoned if guys like that worked here then the character of the dealership isn't high either.I didn't have the courage at the time, especially with all eyes (daggers?) on me but, thank you for your kind words!

You're prioritizing her safety. Speaking as someone who was assaulted, the best you can be is supportive, and show her she can rely on you. It's going to take a lot of time for her to battle this out, but knowing that someone is in her corner, even if she's not talking about it, will make it that much better. Whenever I get romantic with a guy, I get terrified of telling him. What will he say? Will he be turned off? Think of me as \"damaged goods\" or \"too much drama\"? Should I tell him at all?So she was probably going through similar thoughts, or at least stressing about telling you. The fact that you've reacted so positively helps a lot. Don't pretend it didn't happen, but don't change the fundamental of the relationship you have now, if that makes sense. Also, anything sexual, just be patient. She may tense up. She will probably change her mind about one thing or another and may not know how to tell you, so be sure to look for clues- her getting quiet, stiffening, covering her face, or grabbing your hands or arms tightly if you move them to a direction she's not ready for them to go. She may also break down and start crying, shaking and having a panic attack. It was fairly common for me. You've already shown you're a great boyfriend who cares about her, just keep going and be there for her, and know that how you responded is fantastic. Also, don't forget to think about yourself in this. You sound very patient and loving already, so good for that! Just know that if there comes a time, or many times when it seems like she wants to be intimate then changes her mind, there's going to be a chance for frustration on both sides. My ex-boyfriend would get hurt/frustrated when this happened because he felt like I was treating him as though he was a rapist, even though I knew I was safe with him. Rationally, I did know I was safe. But there's also a part of me that was saying I was in danger from the trauma, and I would shake and cry and get quiet. So if she rejects you, it's not necessarily you. Her mind and body are telling her she's in danger, and getting angry or snapping at her when this happens is only going to reinforce what's stressing her out. I was also angry at myself for being unable to do what I wanted. I wanted to be intimate, but wouldn't be able to loosen up or just be in the moment, and it just takes time.

You're prioritizing her safety. Speaking as someone who was assaulted, the best you can be is supportive, and show her she can rely on you. It's going to take a lot of time for her to battle this out, but knowing that someone is in her corner, even if she's not talking about it, will make it that much better. Whenever I get romantic with a guy, I get terrified of telling him. What will he say? Will he be turned off? Think of me as \"damaged goods\" or \"too much drama\"? Should I tell him at all?So she was probably going through similar thoughts, or at least stressing about telling you. The fact that you've reacted so positively helps a lot. Don't pretend it didn't happen, but don't change the fundamental of the relationship you have now, if that makes sense. Also, anything sexual, just be patient. She may tense up. She will probably change her mind about one thing or another and may not know how to tell you, so be sure to look for clues- her getting quiet, stiffening, covering her face, or grabbing your hands or arms tightly if you move them to a direction she's not ready for them to go. She may also break down and start crying, shaking and having a panic attack. It was fairly common for me. You've already shown you're a great boyfriend who cares about her, just keep going and be there for her, and know that how you responded is fantastic. Also, don't forget to think about yourself in this. You sound very patient and loving already, so good for that! Just know that if there comes a time, or many times when it seems like she wants to be intimate then changes her mind, there's going to be a chance for frustration on both sides. My ex-boyfriend would get hurt/frustrated when this happened because he felt like I was treating him as though he was a rapist, even though I knew I was safe with him. Rationally, I did know I was safe. But there's also a part of me that was saying I was in danger from the trauma, and I would shake and cry and get quiet. So if she rejects you, it's not necessarily you. Her mind and body are telling her she's in danger, and getting angry or snapping at her when this happens is only going to reinforce what's stressing her out. I was also angry at myself for being unable to do what I wanted. I wanted to be intimate, but wouldn't be able to loosen up or just be in the moment, and it just takes time.

I\u2019m going to start this by acknowledging that the behaviors and feelings I have are unhealthy. I\u2019m aware of this. I\u2019m looking for others who have felt the same thing and gotten over it/accepted it. My first relationship was with a guy who was no bueno. I had just turned 14, he was almost 18, and I left the relationship feeling disgusting. He never raped me but I did feel like he assaulted me by getting angry and pressuring me. I\u2019ve accepted this and while I\u2019m not proud of it, I know it wasn\u2019t my fault. Fast forward 5 years, I\u2019m in a super awesome relationship. I met my guy in an honors program at school and he\u2019s my absolute best friend. I hate to gush about people but he\u2019s by far the most responsible, mature, and loving person I\u2019ve ever met. We\u2019ve been together for a year now and while we have no plans of tying the knot, Id say yes if he asked. He\u2019s the best influence I\u2019ve ever had in my life. He\u2019s been with one girl before. That didn\u2019t really bother me until he and I started having sex without condoms. Idk why. I waited about 2 months before we slept together, and then another 4 before I stopped using condoms because I\u2019m on birth control. I also let him finish inside me (sorry if that\u2019s tmi). I shouldn\u2019t have asked him this, but I asked if he didn\u2019t use condoms/finish inside of his last girlfriend. He said yes and it honestly broke my heart. This was a few months ago and I\u2019ve accepted it for the most part but I still feel sad about it sometimes. For me, I gave up the last meaningful thing to a person I love, thinking that it\u2019d be the first time for him and it wasn\u2019t. Listen, I know virginity isn\u2019t as important as people say but it is to me. I had something that was valuable to me taken away and decided to do something that was not only scary for me but just had a lot of meaning. We\u2019ve talked about it before and he isn\u2019t proud of doing what he did with his ex, but he made it clear that he can\u2019t change his past and neither can I. His past experiences don\u2019t change who he is now. He continues to be a good person through and through. I really admire him and his honesty, but I still feel sad that I never got to share my first time with a person I care about. I don\u2019t know what to do or how to get rid of feelings that I know are unhealthy. It hasn\u2019t damaged our relationship but I don\u2019t want it to either. I dunno. If you\u2019ve experienced something similar let me know, it\u2019s been a few months and I still get sad about it.

Around 2 weeks ago, I forgot to take my pill but took it the very next day when I woke up, so around 15 hours later. I'm not sure if it affected my hormone levels, but a google search told me it should've been fine.Recently I've been having irregular period cycles. Usually my period lasts 7 days with a cycle length of 28 days. In late August to early September my period lasted 9 days, ending on September 5th. Then, on September 17-23, I got my period again. This time however, the blood was darker/browner than usual and it didn't flow like my regular periods. However, today on September 30th I got what I think is my period again. Again, the blood is more of a dark brown colour. I'm not sure if it is actually my period or spotting, or possibly signs of implantation bleeding.As for symptoms, I feel more bloated lately whenever I eat, and my breasts are a bit tender but that usually happens whenever I get my period. Other than that, I haven't noticed anything else.I'm not sure if I'm just overthinking this because of the irregular periods. I thought that it was irregular at first because of the stress I've been experiencing for the past week or two, but I don't think that stress would cause me to have 2 periods so soon. Another reason for my irregular periods could be hypothyroidism; I was diagnosed with mild carpal tunnel syndrome 2 months ago and I was supposed to get a blood test for hypothyroidism but I haven't done so yet.Sorry if this was confusing to read and understand, but I'm not quite sure what I should do now. I'm planning on taking a blood test for hypothyroidism this week and I've already bought the Clearblue pregnancy test, but I haven't used it yet because of the period/spotting thing and because I'm not sure when I should use it.

Things will be awful and awkward and Handsy may be a pissy little bitch who will complain about you behind your back. It'll make you sick to your stomach for, like, a month. Handsy will, post-snit, try to be super friendly and helpful for a bit. Be polite back but don't fucking touch. Then you'll be back to normal and you will have kept your job and Handsy will hopefully have moved on with his spite and shite. If at any point this does not work or he gets aggressive or makes threatening comments, you're gonna have to get HR involved. I'm sorry. Sometimes despite doing everything to handle this at the lowest possible level it doesn't work.

Anyway he comes into the office .sees me, throws his arms out to give me a hug. I give into the hug .. no big deal..although when I pull away he just kind of holds me for a second and I'm thinking well this is weird , but then he lets me go pretty quickly and I think nothing else of it .Then we chat,  I get his paperwork together and everything is .. fine . Awhile later Im putting my copies away and apparently I was in the way, because suddenly I am smacked on my ass followed by a , \" move your big ole butt\". I was momentarily frozen from shock .I got my shit together , stood up and laughed it off,  but inside I was stewing. I was/am really bothered about it . I've had similar experiences with guys in the   past, but this felt ... worse. Like aren't cops suppose to know better than to do that..  I was sooo intimidated.  It felt like I had zero power times a thousand. So anyway this event just stuck with me all day...Then the next day the same cop comes into the office for follow up . I do my job . Provide him with the items he needs,  speak to him respectfully,  pretend I'm not bothered and go about my business. I'm talking to customers when he ( the ass smacking cop) approaches me. He walks up from behind me and throws his arms around me and gives me a side hug , while his hand finds its way to side boob. I pulled away pretty hard and he pulled me back into him twice as hard .That's when I get a feeling of panic.  Like great I'm going to have to stand here until he decides to let me go ... so a few seconds later I pull away again and he won't let up . In the midst of this the customer I was speaking to asked me to show them something and it was then that he let me go ....\"He let me go \" ...Wtf.

In 2011 they broke odds and came in second place, their best showing ever.After a poor performance in 2015 they did an independent review that found that the party was out of synch with what Canadians wanted. They had no central values, were limited by a promise for a balanced budget and had issues dealing with their stance on the niqab  To explain further the NDP tried to emulate the Liberal big tent by dropping the socialist tag. They attempted to move to the centre and in doing so abandoned their identity.They promised a balanced budget to try and court right leaning voters in the Toronto and Edmonton area because that is the main issue for these Canadians.Finally in Quebec (their bread and butter) they were trying to court Quebec Separatists. Once they said they were pro niqab they basically lost that vote. Quebec Separatists are very Catholic and strongly believe in Quebecois Franco European values.The recommendation was to focus a Quebe strategy in the next election to reclaim Quebec. In the NDP voting system It is based on popular vote meaning that whoever signs up the most members wins.  It's a much smaller party with only 60,000 votes cast (1/3 of the other parties). So whoever came with more members won... which was Jagmeet Singh.There is now a worry for the NDP that Jagmeet Singh will lose Quebec.  The Bloc Quebecois wanted Singh to win so they could reclaim their separatist voters.  While Jack Layton and Tom Mulcair courted separatists.... there would be no way for Singh to do so.It's a tricky spot for the NDP and they just might be headed back to fourth place.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 71984, "stickied": false, "score": 5, "submission_time": "Mon Oct  2 03:19:24 2017", "ups": 5}, {"body": "How can we get media to report what people say?

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these ColoniesFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
