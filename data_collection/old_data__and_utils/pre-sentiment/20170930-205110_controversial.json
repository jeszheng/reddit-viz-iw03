There may be times of feeling left out but it's nothing compared to what others endure because of what whites put them through *in the past* which still ripples today.   What ever side you lean on, the fact is that white people brought black people, unwillingly, to America.  Then Whites let the Blacks go free and had nothing really given as an opportunity because of the hatred in the areas where law required them to be free.Someone mentioned scared to walk in a black neighborhood and be shot if you're white.  That could happen if you're doing something stupid and no reason to be there. But whites gave the black free housing, with good intentions but a bad outcome, by grouping together way too many bodies per square foot in one concentrated area.. How do you blend in a full community of whites and blacks, where everyone wins, when everyone's segregated? And most still are today.  Today! White police officers patrol those areas and all kids see are family members being pulled away for an unknown reason and eventually seeing opportunity.  All some kids are able to honestly see as possible way to make it in life is doing bad things.  I'm in no way saying that's right, or that it's totally possible to combat that and still go to school and succeed. It happens a lot but not enough. Not nearly enough and takes strength where as whites are seen as just being able to glide through school by being pushed by everyone from parents to teachers to succeed.  There's just no arguing that point. Sure many white families are torn apart everyday and sent to foster care.  But no one is being racist towards them for it, like blacks encounter.  If anything, you'll see a black family living in an non-air conditioned apartment on the 4th floor with no elevator, living in horrible conditions and unlikely to even be given the chance to go to foster care where they may be better off than being left alone and doing nothing.Conservatives believe it requires the black community to make the changes they need.  After all, you have to look out for yourself in this world and not blame- no matter what the situation, and just deal with it head on.  It's simple :just put your boots on the ground.  Liberals believe it's the whites who caused all issues in black communities. After all, I made a case above how it's pretty much true that we did start it and are morally obligated to help.  It's simple: just charge the upperclass more in taxes because they make more.Neither are right.  Put them together somehow and we have an answer.  But too bad there's money involved in politics. If there wasn't,  people would make decisions like a teacher or police officer does without feeling guilty and come to their senses for a common ground that works better than what's working now, with an intent on always improving.This became nothing about prejudice sorry for the rant.Huge TLDR...The right has good ideas and bad ideas. The left has good ideas and bad ideas. They both suck for letting money decide almost every policy for obvious reasons: they think with their wallet instead of people as a whole living in the US.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 6069, "stickied": false, "score": 0, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 07:32:39 2017", "ups": 0}, {"body": "Because of prejudice against white people.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 190, "stickied": false, "score": 3, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 06:16:37 2017", "ups": 3}, {"body": "White folks tend to have it pretty good in comparison to POC.

And then more for THAT extra fuel, etc. This is called the [tyranny of rockets](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html). A Saturn-V can accelerate 140 tons of payload to 18.6 km/s with 5600 tons of fuel. Imagine our payload was an extra 5600 tons of fuel instead!So how big would a rocket with 5km/s exhaust speed have to be to accelerate by 1464km/s as required by our two day trip to Mars? Well, plugging bigger and bigger numbers into the initial rocket weight (all fuel!) you eventually get to the nonsense value of 1e130kg to get enough delta-v, which is amusingly many times more than the mass of the observable universe, so it doesn't really matter what size engine/fuel tank you bolt on a Saturn-V tech rocket, it won't be able to make the 1g Mars trip.But let's say we can use more effective engines, that means engines that can shoot the propellant out at much faster speeds. The best engines we have tried are ion-engines, and wikipedia suggests that there might be a citation-needed one with an exhaust velocity of 210km/s. Let's say we manage to scale that up to ridiculous sizes, and put an engine capable of accelerating a ludicrous sized rocket at 1g (and generating the power required for this), and have whole fuel-less assembly weigh in at 140 tons, we arrive at a much more managable [fuel quantity of 150,000,000kg](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rocket+equation&rawformassumption=%7B\"FS\"%7D+->+%7B%7B\"RocketEquation\",+\"mi\"%7D%7D&rawformassumption=%7B\"F\",+\"RocketEquation\",+\"vi\"%7D+->\"0+km%2Fs\"&rawformassumption=%7B\"F\",+\"RocketEquation\",+\"ve\"%7D+->\"210+km%2Fs\"&rawformassumption=%7B\"F\",+\"RocketEquation\",+\"vf\"%7D+->\"1464km%2Fs\"&rawformassumption=%7B\"F\",+\"RocketEquation\",+\"mf\"%7D+->\"140000kg\"), only about 50 times as heavy as a Saturn-V rocket.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 40087, "stickied": false, "score": 18, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 18:03:15 2017", "ups": 18}, {"body": "There are already a couple of good answers.

That isn't entirely true , feminism is about women's rights first , the equality of rights is only the basis by which the advocacy of equal rights was built on. Why aren't feminists against prison rape ? Why aren't they against male rape? Feminist arguments start by saying etc etc females getting raped on campus, not people getting . If feminists really want to be for both genders they need to drop the fem tag and make it gender neutral. Men do not feel included in feminism , so men will hate it. Some women don't feel discriminated,  so they will hate it. If you don't want it to be hated stop the bad feminists giving you guys bad names.

They then start with various accusations and excuses as to why feminism is bad and feminists are evil. Here is a conversation I've just had here on reddit:-person: I disagree with the feminist movement in almost every way. I see my self more as an egalitarian than a feminist-me: Then you don't understand what feminism is. It's the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities. If you're for equality between sexes you're a feminist.-person: They might believe that but it's not what they're trying to get. They don't advocate equality at all, just look at how they talk about rape for instance, they NEVER take into account male victims of rape. The majority of the movement advocates that females are the only victimsI advocate real equality be it race or sex/gender. I take offense to being labelled as a feminist for having that beliefWhy is it that they seem to want to hate feminism with such a *passion*? It feels to me like those particular individuals can't accept a movement that isn't all about them. That as soon as their gender isn't the center of attention they can't cope. If you really are for equality as you say you are, why can't you accept feminsim? After all, that's its purpose. I'm sure many people have had experiences with this, do you have any theories on why this happens?

She's much older than me, and I still have yet to finish college and move out from the parent's house, so it's hard for me to consider things from that kind of perspective.So to start off, she's 35, I'm 21. I don't want to explain everything, but essentially we met while walking our dogs, continued to walk our dogs together every night for almost a week before we started ending the walk at her place & fooling around. After the third time, I realized there was a picture in her living room of her getting married. She didn't wear a wedding ring, so I assumed they were divorced, but I got suspicious and kept my eyes open. Noticed men's shoes and clothes in the closet and a few male products in the bathroom (shampoo, body wash, etc).So last night there were a pair of men's jeans next to her bed, and decided it was the perfect time to ask. She instantly broke down crying talking about how her husband doesn't pay attention to her anymore and barely even acknowledges her existence, especially when he's playing video games (his addiction). He shot down the idea of a marriage counselor but refuses to try and fix anything, and she's dependent on him so she can't really leave him unless she wants to try to live on a $11/hr wage. I assumed this was the end of things, and told her we can still go on walks and just talk if she'd like, but she doesn't want it to end. In all honesty, I don't want it to either, I've experienced a huge boost in self confidence and happiness since it all started (obviously) and I really enjoyed her company even before we slept together. If she's stuck in a relationship where her SO won't even look away from a computer screen to talk to her, let alone watch TV with her, take her on a date, or try and fix their issues, am I really doing something so wrong? I don't want to be a homewrecker, although I might already be, but if anyone has advice as to what to do in this situation or has experienced something similar before, I'd love to hear it.EDIT: To clarify, she's told me she doesn't want anything more than company and sex, and I feel the same way.

You made me feel weak and dirty, as if I asked for something like this to happen to me. You made me doubt my self worth and place in this society. You stuck a knife into an already open wound and dug it in even farther, with no care as to how I would recover. To the coward:I wanted so bad to give you benefit of the doubt. I really thought you understood the seriousness of that night and would have done things differently had you known someone decided that I needed something \u201cextra\u201d in my drink. I wanted to think you were remorseful and were going to be more careful in the future. I mean society tells us \u201cboys will be boys\u201d, so I thought you just couldn\u2019t help yourself. But it has become clear to me that either you don\u2019t care or don\u2019t understand that if a girl is throwing up, or sleeping, she cannot consent to any activities you may want to pursue.\u200bBefore involving anybody in this situation, I reached out to you to give you a chance to redeem yourself, to express regret, or simply acknowledge that you probably could have done things differently that night. Instead, you denied your role in this incident and insisted that I just forget about it and move on. You defended yourself and made no attempt to make amends, even though I had not even accused you of anything. That was when it clicked that you did NOT feel bad about what had happened and there was a chance you did what you did with full intent.\u200bI won\u2019t go into detail about the event that happened or the investigation that followed. It happened and nothing can change that. I will, however, comment on your cowardly approach to a sensitive topic. When I went to Title IX to finally release the emotion and details of a story that had been haunting me for years, you decided to attack. You lied about almost every detail involved and acted like a victim. You decided to use your platform to paint me as slut and put me on trial, to defend myself against accusations that I couldn\u2019t possibly remember since I had been unknowingly drugged and taken advantage of. Instead of owning up to your actions and explaining yourself, you took the coward\u2019s way out and made up a story that would make you look a whole lot better, without any care for my well being. You decided that your reputation and sense of self was a whole lot more important than the complications that were affecting my life. As if assaulting an unconscious women wasn\u2019t bad enough, you had the audacity to lie about it and add to the pain she was already experiencing. To the office that protected him:\u200bYou are even worse. You preach inclusivity and equality but it does not seem to be one of your actual priorities. You say that you protect those who have been treated disrespectfully or unfairly, but I felt so much worse after being involved with your office. It felt like the only thing you were protecting was the school\u2019s reputation and my aggressor.\u200bI came to your office because time and time again, you tell students that it is what you should do if you find yourself in these situations. Haven and orientation presentations drill into our heads the meaning of consent and the resources available to those whose consent has been ignored. But this must be a fa\u00e7ade because the only thing I got out of my time with you was that men are the priority for protection and that I must have been mistaken about what happened to me. Apparently a woman\u2019s word does not really mean anything. Apparently a group of witnesses observing my intoxicated vomiting does not mean that I was under the influence of anything. Apparently the word of one stupid man means more than the words of seven women.\u200bI had nothing to gain from reporting this incident except for peace of mind and a step towards recovery. I had been suffering for two years from nightmares, panic attacks, and stomachaches so bad I would throw up and all I wanted to do was take back control of my body. Instead, you made me feel like a liar and a slut. You made me feel like you didn\u2019t want to hear a word I had to say because the coward had told you the easier story that made the university look better. I understand you are supposed to be a neutral resource, but the language used in your report was so completely biased against me that I was in shock reading your findings. I felt judged and worthless, as if I had made a mistake in bringing to light the very real events that are happening on this campus. But apparently I told my story to a group that was more concerned with hiding the truth than consoling a hurting victim. You ignored my struggles and pushed the messages of rape culture deeper into mind. According to you, it really doesn\u2019t matter if someone gives consent or if they are even capable of doing so, just as long as they don\u2019t make a fuss about it. Apparently, women are confused and don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying when they believe they have been sexually assaulted. Apparently, it\u2019s ok for a man to invasively touch a sleeping girl, as long as he lies about it afterwards. And, because your office decided I was making this whole thing up (which I am not sure how that would benefit me in any way) it could very well happen again and again because this coward sees that he can get away with it. So you have really failed us all. The \u201cprotection\u201d you advertise means nothing. Women\u2019s safety is not a concern at this university. Until you prove that our words mean something and that our right to consent is valid, you cannot say that you are an office for equality. To the coward who couldn\u2019t own up to his mistakes and the office that protected him: you may have decided that this incident didn\u2019t happen to me, but it is an experience I will unfortunately never forget.

The pharmacy technician grabbed it and asked for my ID. Bewildered, I asked if I needed to be 18 or older to purchase it. She replied yes.As I was walking away, I researched about Plan B and I realized it was available for people under the age of 18 and it could be purchased easily over the counter. The state of Texas has no specific age limit that was different from what is stated National Conference of State Legislatures.I went back and informed the pharmacy technician of my findings and showed her (also mentioned that I was 17). She told me she will talk to the pharmacist, and the pharmacist approached me and told me that I was still not allowed to purchase their emergency contraceptive as they only had one brand. I asked if it was Plan B Onestep and she replied yes. I told her there should be no problems regarding my age as I found on the National Conference of State Legislatures website and how \"In December 2011, the FDA approved the over-the-counter sale of Plan B One-Step for all women of child-bearing age.

She then proceeded to tell me to find a friend over the age of 18 to purchase Plan B and to give it to me instead of referring me to another pharmacy. I walked away after waiting in Tom Thumb for over half an hour and managed to purchase Plan B Onestep at the CVS pharmacy in Target within 5 minutes (grabbed the box, some snacks, stood in line and checked out).I feel extremely angered and do not understand why the pharmacist rejected me and provided me with ways to purchase Plan B through a friend instead of understanding that Plan B isn't just for people ages 18 and over.", "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "over_18": false, "submission_time": "Sat Sep 30 22:35:25 2017", "id": "73gm9b", "spoiler": false}, {"author_link_karma": 16, "gilded": 0, "controversial_comments": [{"body": "He could be not that skilled at pleasing you, or maybe not.Give porn a rest.

I eat usually one small meal a day, or something like a bowl of cereal and a ham sandwich. No snacks, sweets, chips, or anything else at all. I'm afraid this isn't healthy. My PCP is aware but we've never discussed it. I'm *terrified* of gaining it back. I don't  get a \"feeling\" of control, like it's quantifiable by an emotion like anorexia. I think it's a factor of my personality. I'm obsessively neat and organized and have a ton of made up \"rules\" on how everything should be done. I have been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive *personality* disorder in the past. Among other things. This happened before when I felt like I wasn't in control of my life. I often forget to eat and almost never have food cravings. The thing is I don't want to get better because I'm so invested in this weight loss. I don't feel any different, my health is the same (very healthy) but I still think I'm too fat and afraid of getting fatter. Even at my lowest weight of 129 (I have a large frame) I still felt fat. All I can see is my lumps and bumps and saggy bits. My only enjoyment out of this is fitting into smaller, more fashionable clothes. Everyone says I look great, but it feels like everyones just saying I'm not as fat. I went from a 16 (US) to a 12. I can fit into junior sizes again. I don't feel better or \"lighter\" or have more energy. I don't work out at all- my fibromyalgia makes me too tired to do much of anything.

Not saying my schools were perfect, but we were actually pretty focused on learning and moving on to college and developing marketable skills in order to find a good job. Kids these days have a ridiculous amount of issues to deal with. It's no wonder our education system has been circling the drain.
