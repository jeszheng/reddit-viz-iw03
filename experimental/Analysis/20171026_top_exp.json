Part of the reason, he went on, \u201cis the commander in chief has used Russian active measures at times against his opponents.\u201d**>To buttress the claim that Trump (unwittingly or not) aided Russian disinformation efforts, Watts cited several instances. Among them: Trump\u2019s citation of an apparently false Sputnik story at an October 2016 campaign appearance; his ongoing denial before and after the campaign of U.S. intelligence of Russian interference in the election; his claims of voter fraud and election rigging, which Watts said was pushed by RT and Sputnik; and Trump\u2019s questioning of the citizenship of former President Barack Obama and even his primary rival Ted Cruz.>Watts added that one of the reasons such tactics are working is that Trump and/or his surrogates have repeated some of the claims, further spreading them through social media accounts that are owned both by real people and bots. Thus, the disinformation is kept alive and gradually becomes more real and plausible. **\u201cPart of the reason active measures work is because they parrot the same lines,\u201d Watts said.**^^[[1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/03/30/todays-russia-hearings-actually-revealed-something-new-and-important/)]-^^1\\.

Let's not forget his disdain for John McCain and soldiers who get caught, but in 2017, the president of the united states is praising a defunct nation that no longer exists for having a \"great heritage\".Jesus H. Tap Dancing Christ.He's the apex of stupidity and his words are an insult to the entire history of American soldiers from Marshall Sherman to drummer boys. I'll be damned if he thinks the fleeing 28th Virginia and the flag they still cry about are worthy of praise and honor. They threw down their flag in retreat and were forced to walk home in shame. This is heritage worthy of honoring? FUCK THAT.Marshall Sherman earned the fucking Medal of Honor for his theft of the 28th Virginian battle flag [(which sits in a MN museum to this day)](http://www.twincities.com/2017/08/20/minnesota-has-a-confederate-symbol-and-it-is-going-to-keep-it/). These are the type of people who define mine heritage. Men who sacrificed so much in order to stand up to a enemy nation. Men who went to battle without shoes, when modern medicine didn't exist, to protect their brothers, their sisters, families and most importantly, their ideals. And guess what happened to those men? Most died at Gettysburg before the flag was stolen. 47 men of the 250 man company saw the sun rise the next day. 82% of the unit was killed, one of the highest rates in US history. Those 47 men, numbering too few to fill a fighting brigade, joined another troop at Cemetary Ridge. These motherfuckers just lost almost everyone they knew, and came back the next day, ready to fight.Robert E. Lee saw a weak point and ordered a charge against Cemetary Hill where he saw an opportunity to flank and route the enemy. Lee called for Pickett to charge, and the 1st Minnesota was called again to a seemingly impossible mission ending with certain death. Outnumbered almost 5 to 1, Major General Hancock of the Union, knowing time was running out, ordered the 1st MN Colonel William Colville to charge the advancing army. Hancock made a suicidal call, but it was a necessary one. Colville immediately followed the orders. Pickett was repulsed 3 times trying to break the Union line buying time for reinforcements to arrive on the ridge ensuring a victory at Gettysburg. Now I'm sure Trump doesn't know this story, but this is the heritage of the states that deserves to be taken away from the civil was. Why is it Marshall Sherman has only 3 memorials, all located at Gettysburg? What does Trump have to say about that badass motherfuckers statues? Will he build more?This is absolutely one of my favorite Civil War stories and apologies if I've made an error. I would jump for joy if Trump tried to get MN to return the flag. Virginia has been trying to a hundred plus years. Litigation, threat of lawsuits, etc and it still sits in Minnesota. Please Donny, get involved and attempt to force Minnesota to return the flag citing heritage.

The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held electronic poll book data and ballot definitions for counties, to demonstrate the system's unreliability.>Wiping the server clean \"forestalls any forensic investigation at all,\" said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist who has closely followed the case. \"People who have nothing to hide don't behave this way.\">The server data could have revealed whether Georgia's most recent elections were compromised by malicious hackers.

I don't think I've ever seen a ~5 upvote post buried in a 500 comment thread get so much attention before. All the real posters on r/politics should keep their heads up and be aware of this kind of activity.Edit 2: More fun observations about blatant vote manipulation:  For almost an hour now, I would check in every few minutes while doing other work on my computer, click refresh on my comment a few times. Every time I clicked refresh the comment score would change from 1-3 votes, up or down. But the total would always change on every refresh. In my experience, that never happens for comments this low scored, buried in a post like this. At least not for any legitimate reason. The last time I saw comment scores change every refresh it was because I had a comment that eventually got thousands of upvotes, in a popular post. In other words, the comment had about 100 times the exposure and activity. But, this? Just keeps hovering. With lots and lots of variance....So, if I get about 1-3 votes every refresh, that works out to about 2 votes... let's say every 3 seconds? That's about 20 votes a second or about 2400 votes per hour. I still have about 10 upvotes. That's pretty interesting. Because that means the upvote and downvote activity have to be basically perfectly aligned in opposition to each other. Even a 1% difference in upvote or downvote rate would produce about 20 difference in votes by now. So the rates would have to be calibrated PERFECTLY. It's simply amazing to think that my little 10 upvote comment could be getting thousands of upvotes per hour of activity, buried in a 500 comment thread, all with the outcome of being perfectly balanced in the same spot... but never too high. It's just so so interesting....", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 82171, "stickied": false, "score": 7, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 26 19:02:02 2017", "ups": 7}, {"body": "Every comment section discussing Dubbya has people saying how much better he looks in the rearview mirror.

Edit: Watching the vote count on my comment vacillate up and down like crazy after [confronting a probable Russian troll](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/78vkw4/george_w_bush_is_not_the_resistance_hes_part_of/doxh5kh/?context=3) (who deleted their comment) sure is interesting! I don't think I've ever seen a ~5 upvote post buried in a 500 comment thread get so much attention before. All the real posters on r/politics should keep their heads up and be aware of this kind of activity.Edit 2: More fun observations about blatant vote manipulation:  For almost an hour now, I would check in every few minutes while doing other work on my computer, click refresh on my comment a few times. Every time I clicked refresh the comment score would change from 1-3 votes, up or down. But the total would always change on every refresh. In my experience, that never happens for comments this low scored, buried in a post like this. At least not for any legitimate reason. The last time I saw comment scores change every refresh it was because I had a comment that eventually got thousands of upvotes, in a popular post. In other words, the comment had about 100 times the exposure and activity. But, this? Just keeps hovering. With lots and lots of variance....So, if I get about 1-3 votes every refresh, that works out to about 2 votes... let's say every 3 seconds? That's about 20 votes a second or about 2400 votes per hour. I still have about 10 upvotes. That's pretty interesting. Because that means the upvote and downvote activity have to be basically perfectly aligned in opposition to each other. Even a 1% difference in upvote or downvote rate would produce about 20 difference in votes by now. So the rates would have to be calibrated PERFECTLY. It's simply amazing to think that my little 10 upvote comment could be getting thousands of upvotes per hour of activity, buried in a 500 comment thread, all with the outcome of being perfectly balanced in the same spot... but never too high. It's just so so interesting....", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 82171, "stickied": false, "score": 8, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 26 19:02:02 2017", "ups": 8}, {"body": "I totally agree and am so scared that the Republicans will be able to successfully separate themselves from Trump.

Right now the rules for duopolies are that there need to be at least 8 independently owned stations in a market for duopolies to be allowed. Also a company cannot own 2 of the 4 highest rated stations in the market. These rules essentially mean that only larger markets (Cities like Houston and LA are obviously going to have more stations than cities like Syracuse, NY and Fargo, ND) can have duopolies and they are usually limited to a smaller station (CW, MyNetworkTV, Univision, Independent, etc) being pared with a big 4 station (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox). However Sinclair wants unlimited duopolies no matter how small the market is, and they want duopolies to be allowed between the big 4 stations as well.

That's when the moderator put up posts saying \"Its just a fetish\". Its not just a fetish subreddit.For people who aren't aware, this is a subreddit that shares information on how to rape, blackmail, steal from, and emotionally and physically abuse sex workers. If that doesn't count as violent I don't know what does. As a former escort, this really does happen and more often than anyone wants to admit, and the information coming from the mod and some of the users is... too accurate. Serial killers and rapists target sex workers because of the social apathy and negativity towards them, and of the illegality of the profession- sex workers are hiding where they are and who they are with, and don't want to call the police. Sex work can be rewarding if you are a very particular type of person, but its illegality creates the vast majority of the danger. Please feel free to ask questions about this on /r/askanescort or check out the top posts of all time to gain a little perspective. I started /r/askanescort so people can see escorts are human beings from all walks of life and as such, deserve basic respect and protection. Members of the sub are friendly and want to talk about this kind of thing! (just stop asking how to hire an escort, there are other subs for that)**Edit: This sub gives people a chance to see a real world example of how the legalization of independent prostitution would save lives. If it were safe for sex workers go to the police, these sickos would not have as easy a time doing things like this. If they could go to the police, workers would not \"need\" pimps/brothels/protection/management- A sex worker could be her own business (which is what independent sex work is). Between legalization and implementing mandatory reporting laws for clients and other escorts if they believe someone is being forced into the industry or underage, we could change the lives of thousands of people.**", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 30324, "stickied": false, "score": 3839, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 26 19:05:01 2017", "ups": 3839}, {"body": "I looked back at the history of the nazi subreddit using the way back machine.

The present study recruited 5,777 American adults and applied self-determination theory to examine how motivational factors influence, and are influenced by, IGD and health across a six month period. Following a preregistered analysis plan, results confirmed our hypotheses that IGD criteria are moderately stable and that they and basic psychological need satisfaction have a reciprocal relationship over time. Results also showed need satisfaction promoted health and served as a protective factor against IGD. Contrary to what was hypothesized, results provided no evidence directly linking IGD to health over time. Exploratory analyses suggested that IGD may have indirect effects on health by way of its impact on basic needs. Implications are discussed in terms of existing gaming addiction and motivational frameworks.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 51055, "stickied": false, "score": 8, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 26 16:14:51 2017", "ups": 8}, {"body": "People can become addicted to anything if it makes them feel good.

The present study recruited 5,777 American adults and applied self-determination theory to examine how motivational factors influence, and are influenced by, IGD and health across a six month period. Following a preregistered analysis plan, results confirmed our hypotheses that IGD criteria are moderately stable and that they and basic psychological need satisfaction have a reciprocal relationship over time. Results also showed need satisfaction promoted health and served as a protective factor against IGD. Contrary to what was hypothesized, results provided no evidence directly linking IGD to health over time. Exploratory analyses suggested that IGD may have indirect effects on health by way of its impact on basic needs. Implications are discussed in terms of existing gaming addiction and motivational frameworks.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 51055, "stickied": false, "score": 6, "submission_time": "Thu Oct 26 16:14:51 2017", "ups": 6}, {"body": "Well, with the latest advent of randomized microtransactions, it's going to start causing literal gambling addiction through the gaming software.

In ten years, no one has EVER answered it honestly. It\u2019s a simple scenario with two outcomes. No one ever wants to pick one, because the correct answer destroys their argument.

Or a million. Because they are not the same, not morally, not ethically, not biologically. This question absolutely eviscerates their arguments, and their refusal to answer confirms that they know it to be true.>    No one, anywhere, actually believes an embryo is equivalent to a child. That person does not exist. They are lying to you. They are lying to you to try and evoke an emotional response, a paternal response, using false-equivalency.>    No one believes life begins at conception.

He apparently recognized a personal bias and attempted to issue a blanket recusal rather than take on cases where he knew he had a personal bias. At least, that\u2019s how it\u2019s being portrayed. The issue in this particular case, according to the article, is that blanket recusals are not allowed. They should be done on a case-by-case basis. Also, he apparently instructed lawyers that they would need to seek a \u201cspecial judge\u201d to have their gay clients\u2019 cases heard - also not allowed. So, in a sense, he seems to have thought he was doing the right thing to ensure those families got a fair trial in front of an unbiased judge. In a way, it\u2019s too bad more judges don\u2019t do that. However, if all judges were to start recusing themselves due to personal bias, it would create utter chaos in the justice system.  Likely many cases would go unheard due to inability to secure a willing judge. But this is why we have so many finely detailed laws and courtroom procedures: to ensure that checks and balances are in place and recourse is available to overcome instances of personal bias among judges.  Also, there is a principle here. Any given person should be able to go to court and feel assured of a fair hearing no matter what personal bias a judge may have. A judge should be good enough to be cognizant of his or her biases and keep them in check. No one should ever have to suffer the humiliation of being told they have to wait for a special judge to take their case because the regular judge has a bias against their race, gender, sexual orientation, etc., and no one should ever have their hearing delayed for these same reasons.

He apparently recognized a personal bias and attempted to issue a blanket recusal rather than take on cases where he knew he had a personal bias. At least, that\u2019s how it\u2019s being portrayed. The issue in this particular case, according to the article, is that blanket recusals are not allowed. They should be done on a case-by-case basis. Also, he apparently instructed lawyers that they would need to seek a \u201cspecial judge\u201d to have their gay clients\u2019 cases heard - also not allowed. So, in a sense, he seems to have thought he was doing the right thing to ensure those families got a fair trial in front of an unbiased judge. In a way, it\u2019s too bad more judges don\u2019t do that. However, if all judges were to start recusing themselves due to personal bias, it would create utter chaos in the justice system.  Likely many cases would go unheard due to inability to secure a willing judge. But this is why we have so many finely detailed laws and courtroom procedures: to ensure that checks and balances are in place and recourse is available to overcome instances of personal bias among judges.  Also, there is a principle here. Any given person should be able to go to court and feel assured of a fair hearing no matter what personal bias a judge may have. A judge should be good enough to be cognizant of his or her biases and keep them in check. No one should ever have to suffer the humiliation of being told they have to wait for a special judge to take their case because the regular judge has a bias against their race, gender, sexual orientation, etc., and no one should ever have their hearing delayed for these same reasons.
