Hint, if you believe the north is full of greedy elites willing to do anything to get money. What makes you believe they would turn down slavery if it is profitable? Now that is in the past, this is the future. If racism was profitable Trump fans, why has the country only gotten poorer even as black Americans received less? You can see through Trump's own tax plan his cuts hurt his voters the worse. His voters maybe not in totality but majority happen to be white. The end results in racist governance for poor white people have always been economic serfdom. That has always been the republicans way of being. They opposed Truman's fair deal and pulled Democrats away from the democratic party. The splinter cell that left the democratic party to side against Truman with the Republicans against the Fair Deal were called Dixiecrats. And what would be so divisive that blue color workers would go against their Democratic President's proposal to push New Deal ideas and benefits forward to bolster the poor and middle class?Racism, Truman wanted the fair deal to go to black people, and the southern Dixiecrats sided with the Corporate lobby bought Republicans solely on the idea it would keep black people down. The middle class white democratic southern ignored the facts that bankers and corporations did not care about color but only see value and cost. The fair deal failed, and you continue to see America stagnation and destruction of the middle class, follow each time civil liberties justice fall to the wayside. The pattern is evident in every generation. When given the choice between true liberty and freedom. Or price controls that impoverish all, starting with black people first.

Unquestionably he died a hero and saved the lives of his teammates with his sacrifice.Her and I have spent many tearful and drunken nights talking about her brother. Sometimes she slips into thinking about his choices and devastating what-ifs. I try, when those topics come up, to gently remind her that we both know he died doing what he loved and even if he could change his choices he probably wouldn't.  It was because of his tremendous reactions, skills and split second decision making that over a dozen of his \"brothers\" are still alive.

When I talk with her about his choices and his death I am doing it from an informed place and with high confidence it will be a consolation. The way I take what Trump said, and the way the family appears to have taken it, is almost certainly not as a consolation. It was flippant and tone deaf. It's not something you say in a five minute conversation. It may be true, but he doesn't EVEN KNOW. It's fucking dismissive!  It's Trump basically saying: Oh, his sacrifice, his death... He's just doing the job I pay him to do!  I'll also add her words here. This is after Trump showed up in Arlington last Memorial Day. His secret service bumped a widow and her children from her spot in front of her dead husband's grave \"These people sacrificed. They gave everything!  They left us behind and we'll never be okay. Nothing is ever the same again and my fucking brother is gone.  I'd give anything to have him back. You've never given anything. You don't know anything about sacrifice!\"We actually discussed what she would say to Trump if he spoke to her at Arlington (real possibility). My suggestion: \"There are only two kinds of people: the ones using you and the ones laughing at you\"She got so angry at her friend getting bumped from the grave that they left before Trump arrived and got shit faced. Her brother would have approved.

Additionally, if we're going to play the \"you've done your time so you're now a full fledged member of society with all the rights of anyone else\" game, then we must be consistent. Sex offenders who \"do their time\" still have to be on the \"sex offenders list\" even though they've served their sentence (correct me if I'm missing something here please). If we're going to give felons like a person convicted of armed robbery a clean slate then we have to also give sex offenders a clean slate too. I doubt very many people would be OK with that. I certainly am not OK with either case.

We are now in a situation where many of those that we rely on for our very protection and defense are unable to see objective reality. How terrifying is that? What does that say to the daily decisions they have to make regarding their military duties? Remember and keep in mind that the ideas and perceptions that go against objective reality that these generals perceive are being regimented daily into our armed forces.

While working in Moscow I learned that Russian oligarchs stole from shareholders, which included the fund I advised. Consequently, I had an interest in fighting this endemic corruption, so my firm started doing detailed research on exactly how the oligarchs stole the vast amounts of money that they did. When we were finished with our research we would share it with the domestic and international media.> > For a time, this naming and shaming campaign worked remarkably well and led to less corruption and increased share prices in the companies we invested in. Why? Because President Vladimir Putin and I shared the same set of enemies. When Putin was first elected in 2000, he found that the oligarchs had misappropriated much of the president\u2019s power as well. They stole power from him while stealing money from my investors. In Russia, your enemy\u2019s enemy is your friend, and even though I\u2019ve never met Putin, he would often step into my battles with the oligarchs and crack down on them.> > That all changed in July 2003, when Putin arrested Russia\u2019s biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin grabbed Khodorkovsky off his private jet, took him back to Moscow, put him on trial, and allowed television cameras to film Khodorkovsky sitting in a cage right in the middle of the courtroom. That image was extremely powerful, because none of the other oligarchs wanted to be in the same position. After Khodorkovsky\u2019s conviction, the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky. From what followed, it appeared that Putin\u2019s answer was, \u201cFifty percent.\u201d He wasn\u2019t saying 50 percent for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50 percent for Vladimir Putin personally. From that moment on, Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world, and my anti-corruption activities would no longer be tolerated.> > The results of this change came very quickly.

Noble> The Telegraph Online> Every now and then, a highly publicised case surfaces involving the use of INTERPOL by one of its 190 member countries in a way that could be considered political. When it happens, various commentators rush to criticise INTERPOL, proposing reforms which demonstrate that their knowledge of the organisation and of its functioning is frequently incomplete, or just plain wrong.> A close examination of INTERPOL's handling of these types of cases, however, should reinforce the view that INTERPOL needs no major reforms.> The case involving William Browder, head of the Hermitage Capital Investment Foundation, provides an opportunity to both correct the public record and demonstrate how INTERPOL's handling of the personal data transmitted via its channels and stored in its databases helps to keep the world safer, while protecting both the rights of individuals and the national sovereignty of INTERPOL member countries.> Earlier this month, the Russian Federation sought the location of Mr Browder via INTERPOL channels in connection with proceedings against him by a Moscow court. Russia neither sought his arrest nor asked INTERPOL to issue its own formal notification seeking member countries' assistance to locate Mr Browder. Russia did everything under the name of the Russian Federation.> Nonetheless, since INTERPOL channels were used, safeguards exist that would have permitted the UK \u2013 where Mr Browder is a citizen \u2013 or any other INTERPOL member country, in addition to Mr Browder himself, to challenge the use of INTERPOL channels for this purpose.> In fact, none of INTERPOL\u2019s 190 member countries objected to the Russian Federation's attempt to locate Mr Browder via INTERPOL.> Yet the strength of INTERPOL's Constitution and rules is that it takes just one individual to challenge the sending of his personal data through INTERPOL channels. And this is exactly what William Browder did.> Because of the strength of Mr Browder\u2019s challenge, when the Russian Federation used Interpol\u2019s channels to seek his location, that very same day Interpol\u2019s General Secretariat exercised its discretion to make the Russian request inaccessible to all member countries, while advising them of its actions. No member country searching Interpol\u2019s databases would have found any information on Mr Browder once the technical steps were taken to implement that decision.> Such measures by the General Secretariat reduce the possibility of a person being detained or arrested based on a request received via INTERPOL channels but under consideration by either the Office of Legal Affairs and/or the independent Commission for the Control of INTERPOL's Files (CCF).> If, despite being aware of such ongoing review, a member country still decides to take action on the information in question, then that is its decision, and one for which it alone must be accountable for.> On Friday 24 May, the CCF ruled that the Russian Federation's request to seek the location of William Browder was predominantly political in nature and therefore prohibited under INTERPOL's rules and regulations. It recommended that all data relating to the Russian Federation's request and to Mr Browder be deleted. A decision INTERPOL\u2019s General Secretariat endorsed and immediately implemented.> Unfortunately, based on a misunderstanding of INTERPOL or of the facts, some commentators on this case made one of the most dangerous proposals I have heard as Secretary General of INTERPOL: that the Russian Federation and other countries not be permitted to use INTERPOL's communication channels as \u2018punishment\u2019 if they are found to have used INTERPOL in violation of its rules.> Imagine if the Russian Federation wanted to share information on a suspected terrorist \u2013 as it did on Boston marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev \u2013 but could not use INTERPOL's network. Or that a dangerous criminal was on his way to the Russian Federation to escape justice, but its authorities could not be alerted via INTERPOL channels. Luckily, this wasn\u2019t the case last February, when a suspect in an attempted murder in Bucharest was arrested by Russian police at Romania\u2019s request.> Wouldn't these same commentators want their countries to be warned by the Russian Federation about suspected child sex offenders, human traffickers, rapists or murderers? Wouldn\u2019t they want their police to have access to the tens of thousands of records shared via INTERPOL by member countries? Of course, they would.> INTERPOL's network allows countries to share information about people both under investigation or sought for arrest. But that information does not legally bind any member country to take any action.> Any country that does not wish to receive any information or request for arrest from another country can simply direct its law enforcement authorities to ignore such requests. Similarly, INTERPOL\u2019s rules allow countries to decide with which countries they wish to cooperate, and under what circumstances.> INTERPOL cannot compel any member country to seek the arrest of any person. Countries acting or not acting on information received via INTERPOL do so voluntarily and according to their national laws, which take precedence over INTERPOL's rules at the national level.> If any country chooses to do or not do something with information received via INTERPOL channels, it should explain why to its citizens and the world. If the information comes from a country it does not trust, it can put in place whatever safeguards it wishes at the national level.> But all countries that use INTERPOL channels must comply with its Constitution and rules concerning the treatment and processing of personal data if they wish that personal data to remain accessible to other countries.> In our ever-changing world, INTERPOL is constantly reviewing and refining its systems and controls. For example, in 2008 INTERPOL strengthened the CCF's status, and in 2012 we adopted a new set of data processing rules which continue to conform to the highest standards of data protection.> In other words, if one takes the time to closely and objectively examine even the most highly publicised and controversial of cases involving INTERPOL, one would conclude that commentators and the public need to be better informed about INTERPOL, not that INTERPOL needs to be reformed.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 44934, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 02:18:21 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "What in the hell is going on in this world, where I'm upvoting NRO.", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 64110, "stickied": false, "score": 1, "submission_time": "Mon Oct 23 01:44:58 2017", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Because he is banned from Russia.

While working in Moscow I learned that Russian oligarchs stole from shareholders, which included the fund I advised. Consequently, I had an interest in fighting this endemic corruption, so my firm started doing detailed research on exactly how the oligarchs stole the vast amounts of money that they did. When we were finished with our research we would share it with the domestic and international media.> > For a time, this naming and shaming campaign worked remarkably well and led to less corruption and increased share prices in the companies we invested in. Why? Because President Vladimir Putin and I shared the same set of enemies. When Putin was first elected in 2000, he found that the oligarchs had misappropriated much of the president\u2019s power as well. They stole power from him while stealing money from my investors. In Russia, your enemy\u2019s enemy is your friend, and even though I\u2019ve never met Putin, he would often step into my battles with the oligarchs and crack down on them.> > That all changed in July 2003, when Putin arrested Russia\u2019s biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin grabbed Khodorkovsky off his private jet, took him back to Moscow, put him on trial, and allowed television cameras to film Khodorkovsky sitting in a cage right in the middle of the courtroom. That image was extremely powerful, because none of the other oligarchs wanted to be in the same position. After Khodorkovsky\u2019s conviction, the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky. From what followed, it appeared that Putin\u2019s answer was, \u201cFifty percent.\u201d He wasn\u2019t saying 50 percent for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50 percent for Vladimir Putin personally. From that moment on, Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world, and my anti-corruption activities would no longer be tolerated.> > The results of this change came very quickly.

The index went down by 17.2 % compared to 2014 and by 12.4 % compared to the average of the previous 5 yearsSo by getting rid of market regulations ('subsides'), production surged, the price tanked, farmers went out of business, then production dropped, demand skyrocketed, and suddenly there's a shortage of butter and spiking prices. Meanwhile, the farms that went out of business aren't coming back because the initial investments are way too large to just stop and start on a whim, plus the lead time of production is about 2 years.Welcome to the new normal EU.

We are taught to view their brainwashing program as a product of insanity from their leaders, when it is a brutal and cold process of calculation and control. They are far from insane, and assuming they are is to make a grievous error.The Trump administration, just like every other US \"democratically elected administration\", has the goal of pursuing the agenda of breaking East-Asia, particularly China. This entire debacle is a gradual escalation into a nuclear strike, or use of any other WMD, into China and East-Asia.The whites that run the US, have never cooperated with any other people, and instead have always resorted to using violence and aggression. It is no different with East-Asia. The Europeans, Scandinavians and white Americans are completely incapable of cooperation and will resort to using WMDs and nuclear weapons on any culture or people that are different from them. They will always strategize towards the destruction of peoples they consider different.The only country willing to use nuclear weapons on cities to achieve their ends is the US. They have proven this already twice. They have proven their willingness to use WMDs on defenseless populations, such as the Native Americans when they applied one of the first uses of militarized biological warfare for their goal of colonization through the complete genocide and destruction of a peoples and culture.Through just these small samplings of _facts_, it is glaringly apparent that this alarmism from a director of an intelligence agency that has lost every kind of credibility, is simply preparing and signalling to the American public the justification for the use of WMDs in East-Asia.Understanding the nature of the US, historical _facts_ that establish their core _behavior_,  and their continued relentless pursuit of a nuclear arsenal capable of destroying every major city in the world, it is not a question of IF the US will again use a WMD such as a nuclear weapon.

That might be true if other actors, directors, or whoever that is working in Hollywood stopped it when it happens, called it out, informed police, and made it clear this isn't something Hollywood allows.No one in Hollywood (or very very few) actually do any of this. Actors will openly ignore the abuse going on. So will directors etc. During award shows they applaud people they know to be abusers, and they still give them awards!When children go to audition for commercials, movies, or shows they have to give the film producers or whoever is auditioning them headshots. You will be surprised to find out that these headshots get sold on Ebay for hundreds of dollars. They do not get kept secret, they get sold on Ebay. You can find this out yourself right now by googling \"Child actor headshots\". Now when you think of \"headshots\" you think of just pictures of a persons face. This is not true. Some are just pictures of a child's face, but they can also be children laying in different positions. With or without t-shirts etc. You get the point. These children are not anyone you would recognize most likely. They are either in small commercials, a side in a show, or in a small film. A lot of the children they sell of the headshots aren't even in anything at all, and got turned down after the audition, but the headshots still get sold!Why are children's headshots sold on Ebay? Who the fuck knows. But it's pretty fucking disgusting tbqh. The documentary goes over this btw, and like I said you don't even need the documentary for proof, google yourself. So what can we do as normal people? Cut your cable off. You do not need it anyways. You can literally find everything online. Movies, shows, and music you can all find online streaming or even download it. Any channels you can also find online to stream if you want. If you need any of this kind of stuff, you can find it 100% online free, streamed for free.This isn't me saying that people who work, produce something we shouldn't pay for. This is me saying, that these people that are producing something for us to buy are involved in basically a child sex ring, and we shouldn't support it in anyway. In fact we should work and fight against it the best that we can.If a coach, a priest, a teacher, or anyone who has power over children, abuse that power, we stand up against it 100%.

They are fighting and dying for the interests of cowardly and sociopathic old men sitting in board rooms.  It's always been a council of elders, since hunter-gatherer times.  It's so difficult especially with older vets.  We hold our vets in an untouchable status - no one can tell them shit - because the ordinary citizen doesn't know what it's like to see their best friend die in war right next to them.  Or anything else like that.  But so many vets, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq... just cannot come to terms with the fact that all of these sacrifices, arguably post-WWII, were for no honorable objective.  They were the results of lies cooked up by the elite to push the military industrial complex a few more bucks.  It's terribly sad but it's the truth.  The entire reason we are in the ME was based on a series of deliberate lies from the US government to the taxpayers...and we are still there years after finding out!  WTF.

Most people have no idea how bad and unjust the UAE is; words won't do it justice so I will just go straight into examples. While you read this massive post, just keep in mind the whole time that a man went to jail for just touching an Emirati man. Now look at what the local Emiratis get up to: 4 Emirati men kidnapped an Ethiopian maid, gang-raped her twice in different locations, then ran her over with a car and then proceeded to stone her to death with large rocks which smashed her skull into pieces. After paying 200k dirhams ($50k) \"blood money\" in total (so around $12.5k each, a few months salary for an Emirati), they were released from prison. One of the attackers 13 years prior had raped and murdered a Pakistani little girl, but her father who was an imam forgave him.So just to be clear, 4 Emirati men, one of whom was already a known rapist and murderer, gang raped and then brutally murdered an Ethiopian housemaid, smashing her skull into pieces, and they were released after paying just over $10k each. Because in the UAE foreign victims are practically forced into accepting blood money by their lawyers (always Emirati), none of them received their sentence. This was the \"Al Dhaid murder\", I strongly insist people look it up because it's even worse than you think. Search \"Al Dhaid murder\" on google for a proper set of results on how serious it was, it's even more grotesque than you think. So basically, this disgusting crime is not as bad as just normal consensual sex because as we know, Emiratis can do no wrong.Here's a story of how a French 15 year old teenage boy \"Alex\" was gang-raped by 3 Emirati men and it turns out that they gave him HIV/AIDS. Anyway, before outcry from human rights groups, it was he, rather than the rapists, that was arrested and blamed. The boy was actually quite lucky his mother was well connected with the diplomatic circles otherwise like the vast majority of other cases he would have been jailed for being raped.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/world/middleeast/01dubai.htmlA doctor examined Alex the night of the rape, taking swabs of DNA for traces of the rapists\u2019 sperm.

The doctor, an Egyptian, wrote in his legal report that he had found no evidence of forced penetration, which Alex\u2019s family says is a false assessment that could hurt the case against the assailants.In early September, after the family learned about the older attacker\u2019s H.I.V. status and the French government lodged complaints with the United Arab Emirates authorities, the Dubai attorney general\u2019s office assigned a new prosecutor to the case. Only then were forensic tests performed to confirm that sperm from all three attackers had been found in Alex.Alex stayed in Dubai in order to testify against his attackers, and went back to school in September, despite suffering unsettling flashbacks.

She woke up in the middle of the desert found by a police officer and apparently she had bruises all over her stomach and private parts. Anyway the most shocking thing about this was that Saoud Abou Sultan, being an Emirati, was not convincted of rape but for \"consensual sex\". He did receive 6 months of jail time which is impressive for a local who usually get nothing, but it was only because of \"consensual sex\" not rape. How the fuck is spiking a girl's drink, gang-raping her and dumping her in the desert consensual\"? Is that worth 6 months in jail?Rape victims, usually maids, are arrested for \"seduction\" or \"extramarital sex\" in the UAE while the rapist Emiratis have impunity: https://news.vice.com/article/rape-victims-are-being-jailed-under-extramarital-sex-laws-in-the-uae One BBC article apparently showed a rape victim being chained up after revealing her rape: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/hundreds-of-women-prosecuted-for-extramarital-sex-in-uae-finds-bbc Apparently one Ethiopian servant who was raped was arrested and when they found she was pregnant, chained her to the hospital bed to prevent her from absconding from her crime of being raped.Another recent story in the UAE where an Emirati woman gruesomely tortured an Indonesian maid for months and then starved her to death. The police recovered her starved, battered and bruised body with torture marks everywhere and found blood stains all over the house. They then realized the Emirati woman had been torturing and starving maids for a decade but they did not punish her or even arrest her, because the maids did not end up dead. Only when the Emirati finally managed to starve a maid to death did the Emirati police bother arresting her. There was a similar case which happened slightly before, where an Emirati tortured an African woman to death after months of abuse. Neighbours siad they heard screams and wails for months through the walls. Read it: http://www.emirates247.com/crime/local/woman-starves-maid-to-death-dubai-court-told-2016-02-26-1.622369Another case of what Emiratis are allowed to do with impunity: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroad\u201cMy employer was like a lion with no mercy,\u201d she says. Marina says she was forced to work 22 hours a day without rest. She woke at 4am to start cleaning the family\u2019s fleet of cars and worked through to 2am the following morning. \u201cI had no time off, no time to rest ever. Even when I was trying to eat, she would be calling me: \u2018You are not here to rest. I paid a lot of money for you.\u2019 To her, I was a slave. I was not a human.\u201dAfter a month of working constantly on two hours sleep and little food, Marina\u2019s health was deteriorating fast. She lost sensation in the right half of her body and couldn\u2019t use her hands. \u201cI was so tired it felt like I couldn\u2019t control my brain. After a few weeks I was in so much pain, I couldn\u2019t walk or lift anything. I didn\u2019t know if my children were OK. I felt so alone.\u201dYet her female Emirati employer told her, \u2018You can\u2019t go back to the Philippines because I paid money for you,\u2019\u201d Marina says. She claims her employer threatened to get her sent to jail, or kill her, and screamed that she would dump her in the desert. \u201cShe told me, \u2018If I killed you, nobody would care and nobody would find you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Madam, if you want to kill me, go ahead.\u2019\u201d After this, Marina says, her boss tried to poison her. The husband of the house then threatened to beat her with a baton, and locked her in a prayer room for three days and nights with no food or water.\u201cI would just say to anyone who is thinking of going to work abroad, don\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will kill you and nobody will do anything to help.\u201dhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroadIn short what I am trying to say is that if you are not an Emirati, you are a subhuman slave to them, a beast of burden. The Gulf states are truly the most racist and dehumanizing places on earth for non-locals. Anyone who has lived in the Arab world for more than a few months knows full well that many of them genuinely and sincerely do not view migrant workers from Asia/Africa as fully human and treat them as animals. E.g. http://www.99media.org/slavery-in-the-arab-world/ \"The host, the mother of my acquaintance, reeled around laughing. \"This is not a human being, she [her maid] is an animal and will be treated as such\" Sometimes the level of prejudice is actually quite amusing because it's so farcical. For instance (and if you don't believe me on this, ask anyone who has lived in the Gulf), the way the police figure out who is responsible for a crime is not based on evidence but based on nationality. So for instance, if an Emirati man crashes into the car of an expat or migrant worker etc, that would be the fault of the expat because he's not Emirati and the former would be arrested. Always remember these incidents before you go to Dubai. Or just don't go at all. Don't give these kinds of people your money.

Read it: http://www.emirates247.com/crime/local/woman-starves-maid-to-death-dubai-court-told-2016-02-26-1.622369Another case of what Emiratis are allowed to do with impunity: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroad\u201cMy employer was like a lion with no mercy,\u201d she says. Marina says she was forced to work 22 hours a day without rest. She woke at 4am to start cleaning the family\u2019s fleet of cars and worked through to 2am the following morning. \u201cI had no time off, no time to rest ever. Even when I was trying to eat, she would be calling me: \u2018You are not here to rest. I paid a lot of money for you.\u2019 To her, I was a slave. I was not a human.\u201dAfter a month of working constantly on two hours sleep and little food, Marina\u2019s health was deteriorating fast. She lost sensation in the right half of her body and couldn\u2019t use her hands. \u201cI was so tired it felt like I couldn\u2019t control my brain. After a few weeks I was in so much pain, I couldn\u2019t walk or lift anything. I didn\u2019t know if my children were OK. I felt so alone.\u201dYet her female Emirati employer told her, \u2018You can\u2019t go back to the Philippines because I paid money for you,\u2019\u201d Marina says. She claims her employer threatened to get her sent to jail, or kill her, and screamed that she would dump her in the desert. \u201cShe told me, \u2018If I killed you, nobody would care and nobody would find you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Madam, if you want to kill me, go ahead.\u2019\u201d After this, Marina says, her boss tried to poison her. The husband of the house then threatened to beat her with a baton, and locked her in a prayer room for three days and nights with no food or water.\u201cI would just say to anyone who is thinking of going to work abroad, don\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will kill you and nobody will do anything to help.\u201dhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroadIn short what I am trying to say is that if you are not an Emirati, you are a subhuman slave to them, a beast of burden. The Gulf states are truly the most racist and dehumanizing places on earth for non-locals. Anyone who has lived in the Arab world for more than a few months knows full well that many of them genuinely and sincerely do not view migrant workers from Asia/Africa as fully human and treat them as animals. E.g. http://www.99media.org/slavery-in-the-arab-world/ \"The host, the mother of my acquaintance, reeled around laughing. \"This is not a human being, she [her maid] is an animal and will be treated as such\" Sometimes the level of prejudice is actually quite amusing because it's so farcical. For instance (and if you don't believe me on this, ask anyone who has lived in the Gulf), the way the police figure out who is responsible for a crime is not based on evidence but based on nationality. So for instance, if an Emirati man crashes into the car of an expat or migrant worker etc, that would be the fault of the expat because he's not Emirati and the former would be arrested. Always remember these incidents before you go to Dubai. Or just don't go at all. Don't give these kinds of people your money.
