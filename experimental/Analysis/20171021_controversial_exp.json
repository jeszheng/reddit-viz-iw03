Clearly our democracy is not suited for this era. When it took weeks or months to travel between states and the government was just a basic framework to keep society running, sure it made sense to have a governing body that moves at a snail's pace. Now, though? In a society where we know enough about the world and have the requisite resources to fix almost every basic issue we are still struggling with? In a society with billionaires and homeless people? A society with the means and motive to mine asteroids and solve most of our resource needs? An intelligent, benevolent dictator right now would result in the greatest progress in human history. We need something where decisions are tailored for the best results and based on evidence and facts instead of emotions - a feat which I don't think our current government will ever be capable of. Perhaps we could design an AI that is programmed with our societal values and knowledge of various aspects of the economy, with specialized AI for different sectors. We could reprogram it every couple of years as a society to change the basic things we are aiming for and then have the AI figure out the best way to achieve that, with some form of human intervention team that is subject to a great amount of scrutiny. Obviously you then run into the issue of who is writing the code and other similar issues around control of the AI, but surely we could solve for that much more easily than we can for the amount of idiots currently in our government.It is so incredibly frustrating to live in a world where we could automate away vast swathes of the labor force and yet we don't because...what? We need people to have jobs? We haven't ponied up the cash? If we took a concerted effort towards automating everything we can and providing every citizen the basic needs of life I am absolutely certain we could make great strides in the span of a decade. We could be essentially living in a utopia if we but tried.

'Self determination' is not a mere phrase; it is an imperative principle of action.\"[6]>During World War II, **the principle was included in the Atlantic Charter**, signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter.[7] The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation.[8] Neither does it state what the delimitation between peoples should be\u2014nor what constitutes a people. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination.[9]>Chapter 1, Article 1, part 2 states that purpose of the **UN Charter is: \"To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples,** and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.\"[18]", "gilded": 0, "author_comment_karma": 87422, "stickied": false, "score": -5, "submission_time": "Sun Oct 22 04:49:26 2017", "ups": -5}, {"body": "Good, you deserve your own rule, your own culture, as is evidenced by Spain's response.

Meanwhile, the anti-independence parties (C with 17,9%, PSC with 12,72% and PP (which btw is the governing party in Spain) with 8,49%) have 39,11% of the vote. The last one, CSQP, has 8,94% of the vote and while they aren't in favor of independence, they are pro-referendum. Sumarizing:* Pro independence parties have 47,8% of the vote* Pro referendum parties have 56,74% of the vote* Anti referendum (and anti independence) parties have 39,11% of the voteYes, it doesn't add up to 100% but that's normal because not every party managed to get representation in parlament.Let's move on to parlamentary seats. JxSi has 62, C has 25, PSC has 16, CSQP has 11, PP has 11 and CUP has 10. That makes:* Pro independence parties have 72 Seats* Pro referendum parties have 83 Seats* Anti referendum (and anti independence) parties have 52 Seats(Total of seats is 135)One thing has to be noted here, both JxSi and CUP made it very explicit that if they got over 50% of the vote together they would have unliaterally declared independence. As they \"only\" got 47%, they decided on making a referendum to let the people decide as there was a clear majority (56%, according to recent polls 82% granted that it's a legal one) in favor of doing the referendum, and that's how 2 years later we are here.Source: https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleccions_al_Parlament_de_Catalunya_de_2015BTW, this is how the catalan map looks like if we look at what party has the majority vote in each area; JxSi is green, C is orange, PSC is red and CUP is yellow. PP didn't win anywhere and they are now taking control of the region.https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitxer:Election_Map_Catalonia_2015.svgAnother BTW, let's talk about what the numbers are for the mayors of Catalonia (important for understanding how there was support for this in all political levels in Catalonia). Recently, 712 (of 947) mayors signed a declaration saying they will provide the voting spaces for the referendum and are now being investigated for it. That's 75% of catalan mayors. The distribution of mayors in Catalonia looks like this:* CiU 437 mayors, 46,1% (CIU is part of JxSi and is now called PDeCat)* PSC-CP 122 mayors, 12,9%* ERC-AM 259 mayors, 27,3 (ERC is part of JxSi)  * ICV-EUiA-Entesa 21 mayors, 2,2%  * CUP-PA 19 mayors, 2%  * PP 1 mayor, 0.1%  * C's 0 mayors  * Other parties and independents, 88 mayors, 9.3%Notice how 2 of the 3 anti-referendum, anti-independece parties have 1 and 0 mayors respectively. And the one with 0 will be taking control of the region until elections happen.

Meanwhile, the anti-independence parties (C with 17,9%, PSC with 12,72% and PP (which btw is the governing party in Spain) with 8,49%) have 39,11% of the vote. The last one, CSQP, has 8,94% of the vote and while they aren't in favor of independence, they are pro-referendum. Sumarizing:* Pro independence parties have 47,8% of the vote* Pro referendum parties have 56,74% of the vote* Anti referendum (and anti independence) parties have 39,11% of the voteYes, it doesn't add up to 100% but that's normal because not every party managed to get representation in parlament.Let's move on to parlamentary seats. JxSi has 62, C has 25, PSC has 16, CSQP has 11, PP has 11 and CUP has 10. That makes:* Pro independence parties have 72 Seats* Pro referendum parties have 83 Seats* Anti referendum (and anti independence) parties have 52 Seats(Total of seats is 135)One thing has to be noted here, both JxSi and CUP made it very explicit that if they got over 50% of the vote together they would have unliaterally declared independence. As they \"only\" got 47%, they decided on making a referendum to let the people decide as there was a clear majority (56%, according to recent polls 82% granted that it's a legal one) in favor of doing the referendum, and that's how 2 years later we are here.Source: https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleccions_al_Parlament_de_Catalunya_de_2015BTW, this is how the catalan map looks like if we look at what party has the majority vote in each area; JxSi is green, C is orange, PSC is red and CUP is yellow. PP didn't win anywhere and they are now taking control of the region.https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitxer:Election_Map_Catalonia_2015.svgAnother BTW, let's talk about what the numbers are for the mayors of Catalonia (important for understanding how there was support for this in all political levels in Catalonia). Recently, 712 (of 947) mayors signed a declaration saying they will provide the voting spaces for the referendum and are now being investigated for it. That's 75% of catalan mayors. The distribution of mayors in Catalonia looks like this:* CiU 437 mayors, 46,1% (CIU is part of JxSi and is now called PDeCat)* PSC-CP 122 mayors, 12,9%* ERC-AM 259 mayors, 27,3 (ERC is part of JxSi)  * ICV-EUiA-Entesa 21 mayors, 2,2%  * CUP-PA 19 mayors, 2%  * PP 1 mayor, 0.1%  * C's 0 mayors  * Other parties and independents, 88 mayors, 9.3%Notice how 2 of the 3 anti-referendum, anti-independece parties have 1 and 0 mayors respectively. And the one with 0 will be taking control of the region until elections happen.

Apparently they use to be really chummy which led to Michelle developing a crush on Kevin, thing is Kevin was already in a relationship. So Michelle found out who Kevin was dating, created a fake facebook account and added Kevin's girlfriend. Michelle would message this girl telling her that Kevin is a womanizer and that he treats women like shit etc, etc. Naturally Kevin's girlfriend tells her about the messages and upon reading them Kevin instantly knew it was Michelle because she types the way she speaks (Michelle is Asian and doesn't speak English very well). Kevin sends an email to Michelle telling her that that isn't cool and she should never speak to him again. There were many other instances that made Michelle a nut job but this really solidified it for me. The fact that she went through all that trouble to try and ruin a relationship for someone because she couldn't have him is crazy. I didn't really like Kevin but that still isn't right.
